He diligently sprayed his fields with 'Malathion 50 EC', a pesticide recommended for controlling the planthoppers. He mixed it according to the instructions, 10 ml per liter of water, and carefully sprayed every corner of his 1 acre (approx. 43,560 sq ft) plot.

He suggested integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, focusing on natural predators and minimal pesticide application.", "normalised": "One morning, he found a dead snake near the irrigation channel.

{"unnormalised": "Ramulu realised the short-sightedness of his approach. He had saved his crop, perhaps, but at what cost? The soil, the water, the very life around him - all affected by his reliance on chemical solutions. He vowed to learn more about IPM and sustainable farming practices. He knew it wouldn’t be easy, but for the sake of his land, his community, and future generations, he had to change. He would start by planting marigolds around his fields, attracting beneficial insects that would naturally control pests, a lesson learned at a significant cost. The taste of a good harvest would be even sweeter, knowing it came without poisoning the earth.", "normalised": "Ramulu realized the short-sightedness of his approach.
