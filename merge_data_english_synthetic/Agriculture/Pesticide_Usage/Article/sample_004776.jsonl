He tilled his 5 acres with unwavering dedication, growing rice and lentils, staples for families across Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "The air in the village of Rampur always carried a certain fragrance – a mix of earthy soil, blooming jasmine from Sita aunty's courtyard, and, unfortunately, the acrid tang of pesticides.

Back then, the focus was solely on yield. More crop meant more Rs. in the bank, a better life for his family. He used pesticides recommended by the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra, unaware of the long-term consequences.", "normalised": "I remember as a child, watching him carefully mix the pesticide, a bright blue liquid, in a large drum.

Experts spoke about sustainable farming practices, integrated pest management, and the dangers of over-reliance on chemical pesticides. Kishan Lal, initially skeptical, listened intently.

The yield was lower, and the pests were more persistent. But he persevered, driven by the desire to leave a healthier land for his grandchildren. He even convinced a few other farmers in Rampur to join him. Slowly but surely, they were reclaiming their land from the grip of harmful chemicals.", "normalised": "That day, he returned a changed man.

Kishan Lal now also plants marigolds on the border of his fields to ward off insects in his 2000 sq ft plot, inspired by traditional knowledge his mother used to tell him about. The change is slow, but visible, demonstrating the power of knowledge and dedication to a better, chemical-free tomorrow.
