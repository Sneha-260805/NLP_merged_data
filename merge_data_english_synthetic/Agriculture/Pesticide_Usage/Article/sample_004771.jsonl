{"unnormalised": "Raman Nair, though, was reluctant to completely abandon what he knew. The pressure to repay his Rs. 50,000 loan from the local cooperative bank was immense. A failed harvest would be devastating. He secretly sprayed 'Dhanush Baan', a potent, older pesticide, on a section of his field, hoping for a quick fix. The next morning, he saw dead planthoppers, but also dead frogs and fewer earthworms in the treated area.", "normalised": "Raman Nair, though, was reluctant to completely abandon what he knew.

{"unnormalised": "That was a turning point. He finally understood the long-term consequences. Together, Raman Nair and Krishnan started implementing IPM on the rest of the land. They introduced a crop rotation system, planting pulses after the rice harvest to improve soil fertility. They released ladybugs purchased from a local bio-control agent in a 1000 sq ft area. They still used pesticides, but sparingly, and only when necessary, always choosing the least toxic option. The yield wasn't quite as high as the year before, but the rice was healthy, and the land felt alive again. The price they got at the Ernakulam market was good. Maybe, Raman Nair thought, tradition and technology could walk hand in hand, securing both the harvest and the future. He knew it wouldn't be easy, and the fight against pests was a continuous battle, but this time, they were fighting smarter, not harder.", "normalised": "That was a turning point.
