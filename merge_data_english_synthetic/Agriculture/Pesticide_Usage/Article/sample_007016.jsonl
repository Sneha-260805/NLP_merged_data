{"unnormalised": "Gopal's approach was simple: if you see a pest, kill it. He relied heavily on readily available pesticides, often opting for cheaper, sometimes even banned, options. He'd argue, “Rs. 500 spent on pesticide now is better than losing Rs. 5000 in crops later.” Ramayya understood the logic, the desperate economics that drove farmers like Gopal.

{"unnormalised": "Ramayya, though, was hesitant. He remembered his grandfather's tales of abundant fireflies and dragonflies, creatures that naturally kept pest populations in check. He knew excessive pesticide use killed not just the pests but beneficial insects too, disrupting the delicate ecosystem. Dr. Sharma had explained this beautifully, comparing the field to a complex raga, where each element played a crucial role. Disrupt one note, and the entire melody suffers.", "normalised": "Ramayya, though, was hesitant.

It was slower, more labor-intensive, but he hoped it would be sustainable.", "normalised": "He decided to take a middle path.

Gopal's field, however, looked barren, the initial surge of pest eradication followed by a resurgence of a different, resistant variety.

Perhaps, just perhaps, he could find a way to feed his village and protect the land for future generations, proving that a balanced approach was the best harvest of all.
