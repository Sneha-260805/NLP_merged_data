{"unnormalised": "The monsoon hung heavy over the paddy fields of Karimnagar, Telangana. Farmer Ramesh, his brow furrowed with worry, surveyed his plot. The dreaded brown plant hopper, a pest that could devastate his entire crop, had made its unwelcome appearance. He remembered his grandfather, a wizened veteran of countless harvests, shaking his head and muttering about the “old days” when neem oil and cow dung were the only weapons against such infestations. Now, though, the pressure to produce a high yield, to compete in the market, forced Ramesh’s hand. He reached for the bottle of Cypermethrin, a potent insecticide he’d bought from the local Krishi Kendra.", "normalised": "The monsoon hung heavy over the paddy fields of Karimnagar, Telangana.

He’d organized several awareness camps, highlighting the dangers of chemical runoff polluting the nearby Godavari river and the potential for pesticide resistance to develop in pests. He’d even showcased organic farming methods, demonstrating how integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, like introducing ladybugs to control aphids, could be effective and sustainable. But Ramesh, like many other farmers in the region, felt trapped. The immediate threat of losing his crop, and with it his family's livelihood, outweighed the long-term risks.", "normalised": "Doctor Patil, the agriculture officer at the block level, had warned about the overuse of pesticides.

He recalled the tragic story of Ramu, a farmer in the neighboring village of Siricilla, who’d used a much higher concentration of pesticide in a desperate attempt to eradicate bollworms in his cotton field. Ramu’s cotton crop was indeed saved, but at the cost of contaminating his land for years to come. The soil, once fertile, was now barren. The cost? Rs. 50,000 in lost income and irreversible damage to 1 acre (43,560 sq ft) of his land.", "normalised": "He carefully mixed the insecticide, following the instructions on the label – a seemingly small detail that many farmers overlooked.

{"unnormalised": "Ramesh sprayed the paddy, the pungent smell of the chemical filling the air. He knew that with each application, he was contributing to the complex problem of pesticide resistance and environmental degradation. He sighed. The solution, he realized, wasn’t simply about eradicating pests; it was about finding a balance, a way to protect his crops while safeguarding the future of his land and the health of his community. He hoped the ongoing research at the Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University would yield more sustainable solutions soon. Maybe then, he could tell his own grandchildren stories of thriving fields without the need for such potent chemicals.", "normalised": "Ramesh sprayed the paddy, the pungent smell of the chemical filling the air.
