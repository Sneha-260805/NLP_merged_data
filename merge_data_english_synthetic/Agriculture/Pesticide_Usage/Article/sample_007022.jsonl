Back then, they relied on traditional methods, like neem oil sprays and crop rotation. But Thatha’s yields were significantly lower, and the labor involved was back-breaking. Modern agriculture, with its high-yielding varieties, demanded intensive inputs, and pesticides were often seen as the quickest and most effective solution.", "normalised": "He remembered his grandfather, fondly called Thatha, sharing stories of bountiful harvests without synthetic pesticides.
