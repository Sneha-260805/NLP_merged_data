He surveyed his 2-acre paddy field, a vibrant green tapestry against the earthy backdrop. This year, he hoped, would be different. Last year, the stem borer had wreaked havoc, decimating nearly 40% of his crop despite his best efforts. He’d consulted Dr. Rao at the agricultural university and followed his recommendations to the letter: application of specific pesticides at regular intervals.", "normalised": "The scent of monsoon hung heavy in the air of Karimnagar, Telangana, a familiar comfort for farmer Rajesh.

Without it, yields plummet, and families like his struggle to make ends meet. The Rs. 20,000 investment in seeds, fertilizer, and labor would all go to waste if pests devoured the harvest. He remembers his grandfather's stories of near-famine years, times when locust swarms blackened the sky and left fields barren. Pesticides are, in a sense, a modern shield against that old terror.", "normalised": "Rajesh, like many farmers in India, understands the complex reality of pesticide usage.

He’s allocated a small patch, about 500 sq ft, for a trial run with bio-pesticides, encouraged by Bhumi Suraksha. It's a gamble, a calculated risk he hopes will pay off. He knows that moving away from traditional pesticides is a long journey, one filled with challenges and uncertainties. But he also believes that the future of agriculture, and the health of his land and family, depends on finding a more sustainable path.
