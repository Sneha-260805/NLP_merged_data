{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's an article on pesticide usage in agriculture, targeting Indian readers with a slightly informal tone, raw data, and Indian references, aiming for around 400 words:", "normalised": "Look, let us be real. Talking about pesticides in farming is like discussing chai without sugar – you kinda have to, but it is not always a sweet conversation. For generations, farmers across India, from Punjab to Tamil Nadu, have relied on these chemicals to protect their crops and livelihoods. Imagine a farmer like Ramlal from Haryana, who has been tilling his land since he was a kid. He has seen locust swarms decimate fields in days, costing him lakhs of rupees. For him, pesticides are a frontline defense."}
{"unnormalised": "Pesticide Usage: A Necessary Evil in Indian Agriculture?", "normalised": "But here is the kicker: are we overdoing it? The Green Revolution, starting around nineteen sixties, pushed for high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, which meant also upping the pesticide game. Suddenly, everyone was spraying like it was Diwali fireworks. And while yields did go up, so did the concerns about the long-term effects. Think about the water contamination in places like Bhatinda, Punjab. Reports suggest pesticide runoff has seeped into the groundwater, causing serious health issues. It is a scary thought, isn't it?"}

They might not know the correct dosage or the right time to spray. For example, some farmers spray at three p m when it is windy, leading to pesticide drift that affects neighboring farms and even residential areas. And let us not forget the issue of counterfeit pesticides flooding the market. These spurious products, often containing harmful chemicals, can damage crops and pose serious risks to human health. I remember reading a report from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I A R I) dated twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty highlighting the dangers of unregistered pesticides."}

That would be unrealistic and could lead to massive crop losses. Instead, we need a more sustainable and integrated approach. Think of it like finding the right balance in a perfectly spiced biryani. We need to promote Integrated Pest Management (I P M) techniques, which involve using a combination of methods like biological control (introducing natural predators), crop rotation, and judicious use of pesticides only when necessary."}

They need to invest in research and development of eco-friendly pesticides, provide better training and education to farmers, and enforce stricter regulations on pesticide production and sales. Moreover, creating awareness about organic farming and providing subsidies to farmers who adopt organic practices could encourage a shift towards more sustainable agriculture. We can learn from states like Sikkim, which became fully organic on fifteenth August two thousand and sixteen. Let us strive for a future where our fields are green and healthy, and our food is safe for everyone. Maybe by two thousand and thirty at nine o clock we can have a national policy in place."}
