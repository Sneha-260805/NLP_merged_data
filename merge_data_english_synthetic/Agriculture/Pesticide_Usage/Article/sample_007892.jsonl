{"unnormalised": "Alright, so let's talk about pesticides in agriculture, especially in the context of India. It’s a bit of a double-edged sword, you know? Farmers like Ramlal from Punjab swear by them, saying they're the only way to protect their precious crops from being devoured by pests. Think of those lush green fields of wheat; without pesticides, they could be decimated by locusts or some other nasty bug. Nobody wants a repeat of the infamous Bengal famine!", "normalised": "Alright, so let's talk about pesticides in agriculture, especially in the context of India.

{"unnormalised": "The truth is, pesticides help increase yield, which means more food on our plates and hopefully, better incomes for farmers. Rs. 5000 per acre is nothing if you are going to increase your yield by 50%. They're used on everything from rice paddies in Tamil Nadu to mango orchards in Maharashtra. The local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agricultural Science Centre) in my village held a workshop on Integrated Pest Management on 20/10/2023, advising folks on responsible usage. They emphasized using the right amount, at the right time, and following the safety guidelines. Like wearing gloves and masks – very important!", "normalised": "The truth is, pesticides help increase yield, which means more food on our plates and hopefully, better incomes for farmers.

{"unnormalised": "But here's the rub: overuse of pesticides has serious consequences. We're talking about contaminated water sources, harming beneficial insects like honeybees (essential for pollination, yaar!), and even posing health risks to humans. Remember the whole endosulfan tragedy in Kerala? That was a wake-up call. Plus, pests are becoming resistant to pesticides, which means farmers need to use stronger and stronger chemicals – a vicious cycle.", "normalised": "But here's the rub: overuse of pesticides has serious consequences.

Responsible pesticide use, combined with alternative methods and strong government regulations, is the way forward. Farmers need more training and support to adopt sustainable practices. It’s not just about short-term gains; it's about protecting our land for future generations. My grandfather always said, \"Dharti Maa ko sanjho ke rakho\" (Take care of Mother Earth).
