The young tomato plants, meant to bring in Rs. 50,000 profit this season, were already showing signs of blight. His neighbor, Laxman Kaka, had lost half his crop to similar infestation last year.

Increased population, demanding yields, and the introduction of new, resistant pests had pushed farmers like him towards chemical solutions. Dr. Sharma from the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra had advised him to use ‘Chlorpyrifos 20 EC’ if the blight persisted beyond a week. He’d resisted at first, trying organic methods, a diluted solution of ‘panchagavya’ hoping for a miracle.", "normalised": "He remembered his grandfather’s stories of simpler times, when cow dung and neem extracts were enough to ward off pests.

The land felt less alive, the taste of the tomatoes somehow different. He resolved to attend the upcoming workshop on integrated pest management at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in Delhi, hoping to learn more eco-friendly methods. He dreamed of a future where his grandchildren could roam freely in his fields, picking fruits without the fear of chemical contamination, a return to the simpler, healthier times his grandfather had described. He hoped for a ‘Krishi Kranti’, a revolution in farming that prioritized both yield and the well-being of the land.", "normalised": "A week later, the tomatoes looked healthier, plump and red.
