He remembered his father using traditional methods, neem oil and cow dung solutions, but those seemed inadequate now, against the increasingly resistant pests and the pressure to maximize yield. He consulted Dr. Krishnan from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, a local agricultural extension center. Dr. Krishnan, a stern but helpful man, recommended a specific cocktail of insecticides for the current infestation, emphasizing the importance of following the prescribed dosage.", "normalised": "Raman, like many farmers in India, relied heavily on pesticides.
