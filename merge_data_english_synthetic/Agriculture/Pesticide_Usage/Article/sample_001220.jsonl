He harvested a significantly larger yield from that small plot, enough to cover the cost of the pesticide and provide a small profit.", "normalised": "Finally, after consulting with Doctor Patil from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Pune, Dada Ji reluctantly decided to experiment with a carefully selected pesticide, Emamectin benzoate, on a small one thousand square feet patch of his land.

The local pesticide dealer, Mr. Sharma, always had a new “miracle cure” to sell, promising even higher yields and pest resistance.", "normalised": "This success, however, opened a Pandora's Box.
