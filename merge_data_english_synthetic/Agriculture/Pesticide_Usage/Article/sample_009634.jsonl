He mixed the potent chemicals – Chlorpyrifos and Cypermethrin, names he knew better than his own relatives in Hyderabad, it seemed – in a plastic drum, the smell sharp and acrid, hanging heavy in the humid air. This year, though, Ramulu felt a prickle of unease. Dr. Patil, the agricultural extension officer from the Agricultural University of Hyderabad, had warned about the overuse of pesticides. He spoke of resistant pests, of the dwindling bee population, and of the long-term damage to the soil.", "normalised": "Protecting his crop, in Ramulu's world, meant pesticides.

Perhaps, just perhaps, he could find a way to protect his crop without poisoning the very land that sustained him.
