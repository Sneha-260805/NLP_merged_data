You know, the stuff your dada ji probably used back in the day, and your kids are probably learning about in environmental science class. We’re in the middle of kharif season, two thousand and twenty four, and everyone's worried about their paddy crop. Are pests eating everything again? Time for pesticides!"}

On one hand, you save your crop from those pesky insects, fungus, and weeds. Imagine a field of tomatoes getting completely wiped out by some bug – you’d be singing the blues all the way to Diwali! But on the other hand, overuse is a major problem. Professor Sharma at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I I R I) in Delhi has been saying this for years: too much pesticide ends up in the water, in the soil, and even in the food we eat."}

Scary stuff! That’s why everyone's talking about integrated pest management (I P M).

Things like neem oil sprays can work wonders, you know, if you catch the problem early enough. My nani used to swear by it!"}
