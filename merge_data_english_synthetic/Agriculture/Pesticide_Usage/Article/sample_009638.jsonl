{"unnormalised": "I remember summer vacations spent shadowing Dada ji, watching him carefully mix the pesticide solution, the air pungent with its chemical tang. He’d explain, “Beta, these pests are relentless. Without these, our mangoes will be lost.” He used to purchase \"Malathon\" from the local Krishak Seva Kendra, always haggling for the best price. Last year it cost him Rs. 1200 for a 5-liter can. The yield increased, of course, but at what cost? The well water, once crystal clear, had started to taste… different.", "normalised": "I remember summer vacations spent shadowing Dada ji, watching him carefully mix the pesticide solution, the air pungent with its chemical tang.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Patil from the Regional Agricultural Research Station in Dapoli often held workshops, cautioning farmers about overuse. He'd explain about integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, introducing beneficial insects and crop rotation. But Dada ji, entrenched in his ways, found these methods slow and uncertain compared to the immediate impact of a pesticide spray. He even proudly showed me his sprayer, covering his 2 acres of land (roughly 87,120 sq ft) in a matter of hours.", "normalised": "Doctor Patil from the Regional Agricultural Research Station in Dapoli often held workshops, cautioning farmers about overuse.

The journey is long, but the sweetness of success, when it arrives, will be all the more rewarding, preserving both the mangoes and the land for generations to come.
