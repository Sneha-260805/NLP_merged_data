{"unnormalised": "But Ramrao, like many farmers in the region, sometimes cut corners. The heat was stifling, the protective gear cumbersome. He'd heard rumours – whispers really – about farmers using stronger, cheaper, and often illegal pesticides to combat particularly resistant infestations. Stories of entire fields being wiped out by overuse were common, followed by the tragic suicides of debt-ridden farmers. He hoped he wouldn’t come to that.", "normalised": "But Ramrao, like many farmers in the region, sometimes cut corners. The heat was stifling, the protective gear cumbersome.

He felt a pang of guilt, a nagging worry about the long-term consequences for his land, for his family’s health, and for the health of the consumers who would eventually buy his cotton. He knew this cycle couldn't continue forever. He hoped, prayed even, for a better, sustainable way. Perhaps, next season, he'd try planting marigolds around his 1000 sq ft vegetable patch, just like Bala Kaka. He needed a plan, a roadmap away from this chemical dependency.
