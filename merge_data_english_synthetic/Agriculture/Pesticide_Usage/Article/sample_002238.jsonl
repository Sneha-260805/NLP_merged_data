From Punjab's wheat fields to Tamil Nadu's rice paddies, pesticides have become almost synonymous with farming.

He'd say, \"Ramesh, nature provides the best protection!\" And he'd have a point, crops were healthy, though yields were lower. Now, farmers in my village, Ramnagar, routinely spray all sorts of concoctions – brand names I can barely pronounce, let alone understand! They're chasing higher yields, bigger profits, especially around harvest time, say, around twentieth April two thousand and twenty four."}

The mandi price fluctuations in Delhi are enough to give anyone a heart attack. A good crop, free of pests, fetches a decent price. A bad one? You're staring at debt. This is where the pesticides come in. They promise a quick fix, a shield against those pesky insects and diseases that can devastate a field overnight."}

I remember attending a Krishi Mela in Pusa, Delhi on tenth October two thousand and twenty three. An agriculture officer from I A R I was giving a talk.

My cousin, Priya, who's studying agriculture at G B Pant University, says integrated pest management (I P M) is the way forward. It's all about using a combination of methods – natural predators, crop rotation, and targeted pesticide application only when absolutely necessary. She says training programs are crucial, and they need to be more accessible to small farmers in remote areas."}

We need to feed a growing population, but not at the cost of our health and environment. A shift towards sustainable practices, along with stricter regulations and better farmer education, is crucial. Maybe then, we can find a way to farm smarter, not harder, and leave a healthy land for our future generations. After all, what's the point of earning more if we're all sick?"}
