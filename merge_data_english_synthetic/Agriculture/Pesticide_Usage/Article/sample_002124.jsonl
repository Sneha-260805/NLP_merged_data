It is a topic hotter than a Delhi summer in June. On one hand, you have got your crops, beautiful bounty promised after months of hard work under the scorching sun – think fields of golden wheat shimmering near Amritsar, or lush green paddy terraces in Kerala. On the other, you have got pests – those little buggers (literally!) that want to chow down on your hard-earned livelihood."}

They are like that spicy masala we add to everything – a little bit makes the dish amazing, too much and B A M! Stomach upset, or worse. The same goes for our crops. We spray these chemicals, thinking we are protecting our yield, ensuring a good harvest that will fetch a good price at the mandi. Rupee two thousand per quintal sounds nice, doesn’t it?"}

My nani used to say, \"Slow and steady wins the race.\" Slathering everything in pesticide might seem like a quick fix, like applying Fair and Lovely cream before a wedding on twelfth december two thousand and twenty four, but what about the long-term effects?"}

It is not just dirt, it is a living, breathing ecosystem! All those helpful microbes that keep things healthy? Pesticides can wipe them out, leaving us with dead, infertile land. And what about the water? Pesticide runoff can contaminate our rivers and groundwater, affecting everyone from the farmer irrigating his fields to the chaiwala making your morning brew at six zero zero hours."}

I P M is all about using a variety of methods to control pests, minimizing the need for harsh chemicals. Think things like crop rotation, introducing beneficial insects, and using targeted pesticides only when absolutely necessary. Like using a neem-based spray rather than the heavy stuff, right? Even Doctor Sharma from my village, after attending a Krishi Mela at ten thirty A M on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty three, switched to organic methods on a small patch of his land. He says the taste of the vegetables is just out of this world."}

Let us aim for a balanced approach, a “Goldilocks zone” where we protect our crops without poisoning our planet. Jai Kisan! Let us aim for yields that benefit our families, not just chemical companies."}
