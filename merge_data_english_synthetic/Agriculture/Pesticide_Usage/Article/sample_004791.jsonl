Ramlal, however, was already on his third round of sprays, his initial success fading as the bollworms returned, now even more resistant. Kisanrao managed a respectable harvest, enough to cover Lakshmi’s fees and provide for his family. He felt a sense of quiet satisfaction, knowing he had chosen a path that was sustainable, albeit less immediately rewarding. He had protected his land, a patch of about 20,000 sq ft, and contributed, in his small way, to a healthier future for his community.
