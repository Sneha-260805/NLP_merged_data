The problem is complex, requiring a multifaceted approach involving education, regulation, and a shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices. For now, Sardar Gurpreet Singh stands at a crossroads, caught between tradition, economic pressure, and the need to protect his land and his family's future. He knows, deep down, that another year of blindly spraying chemicals might yield a harvest, but it would also sow the seeds of a more significant, more lasting problem.
