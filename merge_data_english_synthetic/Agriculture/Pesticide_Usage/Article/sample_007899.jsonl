We all know that pesticides, those sprays and powders we use on our crops, are kind of a double-edged sword. On one hand, they protect our hard-earned harvest from pests like those pesky bollworms that can devastate cotton crops in Vidarbha, or the locust swarms that threaten Rajasthan. Imagine spending months nurturing your rice paddy, only to have it wiped out by brown planthoppers. That's where pesticides come in, right? A quick spray, and poof, problem solved (at least for a while)."}

Back in his day, before the Green Revolution really took off, yields were low, and crop loss due to pests was a constant worry. Pesticides, along with high-yielding varieties, helped change all that. Remember the nineteen sixties? The push for self-sufficiency? Yeah, pesticides played a big role."}

We've all heard stories about the negative effects of pesticides. From the tragic Bhopal Gas Tragedy on third december nineteen eighty four, although not directly related to agriculture but a major eye-opener, to concerns about residues in our food and water, the worries are real. Many small farmers in places like Bihar and U P, sometimes don’t get proper training on safe usage. They might use too much, or the wrong kind, or not wear protective gear. I read a report from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I A R I) that said improper pesticide use is a major issue, especially among marginal farmers with less than two hectares of land."}

The bugs, being the clever little things they are, evolve and become immune to the chemicals we throw at them. So, we need stronger and stronger pesticides, leading to a vicious cycle. My neighbor, Sharmaji, was complaining just last week (on fourteenth july two thousand and twenty three, around fourteen hundred hours) that the pesticides he used to use on his tomato crop aren't working anymore."}

Abandon pesticides altogether? Probably not realistic in the short term, especially if we want to feed a billion-plus population. But we need to be smarter about it. Integrated Pest Management (I P M), which combines different strategies like using natural predators and biopesticides, could be a good way forward. The Punjab Agricultural University (P A U) has some great resources on this. We need more training and awareness programs for farmers, especially in remote areas. The Krishi Vigyan Kendras (K V Ks) are doing good work, but we need more of them! And hey, let's not forget good old traditional methods like crop rotation. Our grandmothers knew a thing or two about keeping pests away! Maybe we should listen to them more often. I saw a government ad on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four promoting organic farming in Chattisgarh. It looked promising. Let's hope more farmers are encouraged to adopt such practices."}
