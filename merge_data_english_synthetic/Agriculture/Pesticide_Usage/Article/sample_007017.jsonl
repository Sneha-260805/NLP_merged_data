{"unnormalised": "Gurpreet remembered his grandfather's methods – a mix of traditional practices and minimal pesticide use. They relied on crop rotation, neem-based solutions, and fervent prayers to the rain gods for pest control. Back then, yields were lower, but so was the reliance on chemical inputs. Things had changed since then. The Green Revolution promised higher yields, and with it came a dependence on pesticides.", "normalised": "Gurpreet remembered his grandfather's methods – a mix of traditional practices and minimal pesticide use.

{"unnormalised": "The temptation to blanket his field with pesticides was strong. Neighbor Ramlal had already sprayed his paddy crop twice this season, boasting of its pest-free appearance. \"Look at my field, Gurpreet,\" Ramlal had said, \"Not a single pest in sight!

{"unnormalised": "Gurpreet decided to try a middle path. He started with careful monitoring, walking through his field every morning, checking the underside of leaves for pests. He noticed a small infestation of brown planthoppers in a section covering approximately 500 sq ft. Instead of spraying the entire field, he targeted only that area with a recommended dose of a less harmful pesticide, as suggested in the PAU guidelines.", "normalised": "Gurpreet decided to try a middle path.
