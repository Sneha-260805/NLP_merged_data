Like many farmers in the region, Mr. Sharma has seen yields decline over the years. Initially, the Green Revolution promised prosperity, and part of that promise was the increased use of pesticides. They seemed like a silver bullet against pests like the stem borer and the brown plant hopper that threatened his paddy crop.", "normalised": "The scent of freshly tilled earth in Mister Sharma's five acre farm in Haryana used to be intoxicating.

Back then, yields were lower, but so were the input costs, and the soil felt… alive. Now, even after spraying expensive pesticides recommended by the local agricultural officer from PAU (Punjab Agricultural University), he sees resistant pests thriving.", "normalised": "He remembers his father, a traditional farmer, relying on neem-based concoctions and crop rotation to manage pests.
