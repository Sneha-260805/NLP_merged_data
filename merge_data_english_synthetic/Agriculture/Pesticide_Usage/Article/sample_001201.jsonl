Farmer Ramrao Patil, a weathered man with hands as tough as teak wood, surveyed his cotton field with a worried frown. His 5 acres, usually a sea of green, were dotted with patches of wilted plants, victims of a stubborn bollworm infestation.

He remembered his grandfather’s days, when indigenous methods like neem oil and cow dung concoctions were enough to ward off insects. But with the introduction of high-yielding Bt cotton varieties and the pressure to increase yields, the old ways had fallen by the wayside. Now, he consulted the Krishi Kendra, a government agricultural extension center, and Dr. Sharma, the local agriculture officer, on which pesticide to use. This time, it was a cocktail of chemicals – a mix of organophosphates and pyrethroids, as prescribed on the leaflet.", "normalised": "Ramrao, like many farmers in his village near Nagpur, relied on pesticides as a shield against the relentless onslaught of pests.

The smell of the chemicals was sharp and metallic, a constant reminder of the potential risks. He covered his face with a gamcha, a traditional Indian towel, but the protection felt flimsy.

The cost of pesticides was a constant burden, often pushing them deeper into debt with local moneylenders who charged exorbitant interest rates (Rs. 5 per Rs. 100 per month). One farmer, Govind, mentioned a training program organized by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on integrated pest management (IPM), a more sustainable approach.
