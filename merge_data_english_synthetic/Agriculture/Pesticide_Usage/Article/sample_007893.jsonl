Let's talk pesticides, a topic that’s as common as chai at a roadside dhaba during harvest season. Every farmer, from Punjab to Tamil Nadu, knows about them. We all use them, right? But how much is too much, and are we actually hurting ourselves in the long run?"}

Imagine a bumper crop of rice in your fields in Bihar, all ready for harvest, and then boom! A sudden locust attack on twenty third july two thousand and twenty three wipes out half of it overnight. That’s where pesticides come in, offering a quick fix. Who wouldn’t reach for a bottle of something that promises to save their livelihood?"}

Farmers, sometimes without proper training or understanding, might overdose pesticides hoping for better results. Or, they might not follow the recommended waiting periods between spraying and harvesting. This leads to pesticide residue in our food, and that's a big problem for all of us, isn't it?
