He’d spent the last few weeks meticulously tending his paddy fields, hoping for a good yield this Kharif season.

The local Agri-input shop, run by Mr. Sharma, had a whole shelf dedicated to various formulations, each promising miraculous results. Ramanna, despite his reservations about the increasing cost (Rs. 500 for a small bottle!), purchased a recommended dose. He carefully followed the instructions, spraying the pesticide across his 2 acres of land, the pungent smell lingering in the air.", "normalised": "His neighbor, Govind Reddy, swore by a particular brand, claiming it had saved his chili crop last year.

But yields were lower then, and the pressure to produce more, to feed a growing nation, was immense.

Perhaps next season, he thought, he would seriously consider Dr. Patil's IPM recommendations and reduce his reliance on these potent, albeit temporary, solutions. Maybe, just maybe, he could find a way to protect his crops and the land that sustained him, without solely relying on the crutch of pesticides. He wished for a healthier future, a future where the yield wasn't measured just in quintals per hectare, but also in the well-being of his family and the health of the soil – every inch of his 87,120 sq ft plot.", "normalised": "Ramanna felt a pang of guilt as he looked at his fields, now coated in a fine layer of chemicals.
