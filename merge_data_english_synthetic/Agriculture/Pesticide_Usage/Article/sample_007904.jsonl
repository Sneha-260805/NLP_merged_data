Let's talk pesticides. You know, the stuff we spray on our crops to keep those pesky insects and weeds away.

Remember all those high-yielding varieties developed at places like the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I A R I) in Delhi? They were amazing, boosted our yields, but also needed more protection from pests. Think of it like this: you get a fancy new car, you also need a good car alarm."}

Imagine if all the locusts that threatened Rajasthan back in two thousand and twenty had actually succeeded in wiping out the crops! We would've been in serious trouble.

It's all about using a mix of methods – natural predators, crop rotation, and yes, pesticides – but only when absolutely necessary, and in the right amounts. Like using Neem oil instead of the stronger chemical ones, when possible. A lot of farmers in Vidarbha are experimenting with organic farming techniques, and they are seeing decent results."}
