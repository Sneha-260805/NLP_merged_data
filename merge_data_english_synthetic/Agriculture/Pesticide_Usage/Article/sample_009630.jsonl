It was a good year; the monsoon had been kind, filling the fields with just enough water. But Kamal's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. The stem borers, those tiny, rice-eating pests, were back. He knew what he had to do – spray.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamal's back as he walked through his rice paddy in Burdwan, West Bengal.

{"unnormalised": "Kamal remembered his grandfather, Dada, tilling the land, relying on natural methods. Dada would use neem leaves and ash to ward off insects, methods passed down through generations. But yields were low, often barely enough to feed the family. When the Green Revolution swept through India, promising higher yields and greater prosperity, Kamal's father embraced chemical pesticides wholeheartedly. DDT, Endosulfan, you name it, he used it. The initial results were astounding. Production soared.", "normalised": "Kamal remembered his grandfather, Dada, tilling the land, relying on natural methods.

{"unnormalised": "Now, Kamal, a modern farmer, armed with a degree in Agriculture from Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, felt the weight of that legacy. He knew the dangers of indiscriminate pesticide use. He'd seen the fish die in the village pond after heavy rains washed the chemicals away. He'd heard Dr. Sharma at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra talk about the long-term effects on soil health and human health. Rs. 1000 for a litre of Chlorpyrifos felt like a necessary evil.", "normalised": "Now, Kamal, a modern farmer, armed with a degree in Agriculture from Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, felt the weight of that legacy.

They helped, but not enough. His neighbour, Ramlal, had already sprayed twice, and his fields looked pristine. The pressure to keep up was immense. A bad harvest meant debt, hardship for his family, and shame in the village.", "normalised": "He’d tried integrated pest management, as taught in college.

{"unnormalised": "Kamal carefully measured the pesticide, mixing it with water in the correct proportions. He used a knapsack sprayer, its nozzle hissing as he walked row by row. He wore a mask, a small victory against the invisible threat. He knew that one day, perhaps with newer technologies and more research from ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research), he wouldn't have to rely so heavily on these chemicals. He dreamt of a day when he could manage his 5000 sq ft plot with only the wisdom of his Dada and the knowledge of modern science, a perfect blend. He looked up at the scorching sun, praying for a better way, a safer way.", "normalised": "Kamal carefully measured the pesticide, mixing it with water in the correct proportions.
