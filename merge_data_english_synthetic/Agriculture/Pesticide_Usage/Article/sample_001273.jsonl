{"unnormalised": "The monsoon hung heavy over the fields of Punjab, promising a bountiful harvest. But for farmers like Balwinder Singh of village Khiala Kalan, the green shoots brought a familiar anxiety: pests. For generations, Balwinder’s family had relied on pesticides to protect their rice crop, a practice deeply ingrained in the agricultural landscape. The local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Ludhiana had, for years, advised on the ‘right’ dosage and ‘appropriate’ chemical for each infestation. Balwinder vividly remembers his grandfather recounting stories of losing entire crops to locust swarms before the widespread adoption of synthetic pesticides. Now, the fear of financial ruin due to pest damage kept him spraying, sometimes more than the recommended Rs. 2000/acre worth.", "normalised": "The monsoon hung heavy over the fields of Punjab, promising a bountiful harvest.

Farmers, often with limited access to alternative pest control methods or comprehensive training, perceive pesticides as a quick and effective solution. Dr. Sharma, an entomologist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, acknowledges the predicament. “Pesticides are a double-edged sword,” he explains. “They provide immediate relief but prolonged, indiscriminate use can lead to resistance in pests, soil degradation, and potential health hazards.”", "normalised": "The narrative isn't unique to Balwinder.
