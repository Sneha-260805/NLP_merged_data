We sprayed it as instructed, twice, first on 22/07/2023 and then again on 01/08/2023 at 17:00 hrs. It seemed to work initially, but the pests came back with a vengeance, even stronger!", "normalised": "Last year, after the monsoon season, we had a really bad infestation of stem borers.

Any suggestions or experiences you can share would be highly appreciated! Especially interested in knowing about any government schemes or subsidies for farmers trying to reduce pesticide usage. Thinking of attending the Krishi Mela on 15/08/2024, hoping to find some answers there. Thanks in advance! Jai Kisan!", "normalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues? What are some alternatives?
