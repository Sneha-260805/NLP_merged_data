My baingan (eggplant) crop in my farm near Nashik is getting hammered by some kinda pest. Yield's down like crazy. Last year, I got almost fifty quintals, this time maybe half?"}

My neighbour, Sharmaji, mentioned something about a pesticide called \"RangerX\" from a company based out of Bangalore he used last year after consulting someone from the I A R I (Indian Agricultural Research Institute) but I don't remember the dosage."}

Or suggestions for effective but reasonably responsible pesticides for eggplant? Is it even worth spraying this late, its already twenty eighth july two thousand and twenty four? Ideally, I'd like to spray before the weekly market at two P M on first august two thousand and twenty four. Also, any advice on application – dosage per acre, timing of spray (morning versus evening etc.). Trying to balance yield with environmental responsibility. Also, the local kheti kendra guy said something about needing to adjust for the monsoon, which starts around tenth june two thousand and twenty four usually. Thanks in advance, Jai Hind!"}
