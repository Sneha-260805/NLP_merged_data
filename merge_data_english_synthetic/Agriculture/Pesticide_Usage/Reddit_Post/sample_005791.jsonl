He buys it from some shady supplier near the mandi in Akola on market days.

{"unnormalised": "Is anyone else facing this issue? Any tips on how to convince older farmers to use less pesticide, or even better, explore organic farming? I know the yield might be lower initially, but surely it's better for everyone in the long run, right? Considering maybe looking into courses at IARI, Pusa, but honestly, the resources seem geared towards large-scale farms. Maybe someone has experience after training sometime on 26/01/2010, and can help out? Any advice would be appreciated!
