I sprayed like mad, using the recommended stuff from the agri centre near my village, something called 'Combat 505' (yeah, sounds like a Rajinikanth movie!). But honestly, it felt like I was just spraying water. Barely made a dent!", "normalised": "So, I am a small-time farmer in Maharashtra, growing mainly bajra and some toor dal.

{"unnormalised": "I'm thinking of trying some IPM (Integrated Pest Management) stuff this year, like releasing ladybugs (they eat the aphids, right?). Anyone have experience with that near Pune? I've read stuff from the IARI website, but practical advice from fellow farmers is always better. I've also been seeing ads for some \"organic\" pesticides that cost an arm and a leg – are they actually worth the Rs.? Planning to attend a Krishi Mela on 26/01/2024 near Nasik, maybe I'll find some answers there. Any recs? I need to protect my crops, harvest time is around 10/10/2024 and I can't afford another bad year. Thinking about visiting my local agriculture officer at 11:00 hrs on 01/05/2024 as well.
