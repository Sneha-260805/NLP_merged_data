{"unnormalised": "Crop insurance, huh? My kisan friend Ramesh from Kerala says it's a mixed bag. Sometimes it helps after heavy rains, like during Onam season, damaging the paddy fields. Other times, the claim process feels longer than waiting for the monsoon! Heard the payouts from that scheme near Nashik weren't great either. He needs it for his rice crop. Hopefully, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana works better next time. Even a small claim of Rs. 5000 makes a difference, especially for small land holdings. Makes you wanna just eat biryani and forget about it!", "normalised": "Crop insurance, huh? My farmer friend Ramesh from Kerala says it is a mixed bag.
