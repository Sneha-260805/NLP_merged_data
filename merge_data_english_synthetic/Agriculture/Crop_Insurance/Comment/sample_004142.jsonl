{"unnormalised": "Crop insurance, huh? My kisan friend, Rajesh from Kerala, nearly lost his whole paddy crop last year due to floods. Luckily, he had PMFBY. Getting the claim was a bit of a hassle, took like 3 months and numerous visits to the Bank of India branch in Kochi. He almost missed Onam sadhya because of the tension. Hope they streamline the process, especially for small farmers facing issues in places like Bihar. Rs. 2 lakh relief hardly covers the actual loss of a good crop.", "normalised": "Crop insurance, huh? My kisan friend, Rajesh from Kerala, nearly lost his whole paddy crop last year due to floods.
