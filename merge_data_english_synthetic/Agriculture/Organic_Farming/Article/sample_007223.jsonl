But something had shifted. The chemical fertilizers, once hailed as miracle workers, were now leaving the soil barren and her family's health compromised. That's when Kamala, inspired by a Krishi Vigyan Kendra workshop in Kochi, decided to make a change: to embrace organic farming.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamala's face as she surveyed her small plot in Kerala.

This is Kali Yuga; you need chemicals to survive!\" But Kamala persevered. She learned about composting techniques, using cow dung and discarded vegetable matter to enrich the soil. She introduced companion planting, growing marigolds alongside her tomatoes to deter pests, a practice recommended by Dr. Sharma at the agricultural university.", "normalised": "Her journey wasn't easy.

People began to appreciate the richer taste and the peace of mind that came with knowing their food was free from harmful pesticides.

He was right, wasn't he?\" The extra Rs. 5000/month profit doesn’t hurt either! It proved that even in this age, traditional wisdom, coupled with modern knowledge, can flourish.
