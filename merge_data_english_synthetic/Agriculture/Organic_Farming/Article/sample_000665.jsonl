Instead, we’re talking about good old-fashioned cow dung manure, compost, and natural pest control methods like using neem oil. Think of it as giving Mother Nature a big hug and letting her do her thing.", "normalised": "So, what’s the big deal? Well, basically, it's farming without the nasties.

{"unnormalised": "Farmers like Mr. Sharma from Haryana are leading the charge. He's been practicing organic farming for over 10 years now and swears by it. He says his soil is healthier than ever and his produce tastes way better – think juicy, sun-ripened mangoes that explode with flavour, unlike the ones you get pumped with chemicals from the market. He even sells his produce directly to consumers at a higher price, earning himself a tidy profit.", "normalised": "Farmers like Mister Sharma from Haryana are leading the charge.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses. Converting to organic farming can be tough initially. Yields might drop in the first couple of years as the soil adjusts.

It reduces soil erosion, conserves water, and promotes biodiversity. Plus, it creates a more sustainable system in the long run.
