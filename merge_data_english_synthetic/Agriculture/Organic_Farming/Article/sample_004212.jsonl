{"unnormalised": "Now, organic farming ain’t just a trend; it's a philosophy. Instead of dousing fields with chemicals, we’re talking about using stuff like cow dung (gomutra too, sometimes!), compost, and crop rotation to enrich the soil. Remember that dusty old agriculture textbook from school? Well, it’s probably more relevant now than ever! We're basically mimicking nature's own processes. Think of it like this: instead of forcing the plants to grow with artificial boosters, we're giving them a nutritious \"desi\" diet.", "normalised": "Now, organic farming ain’t just a trend; it's a philosophy.

{"unnormalised": "Why should we bother, you ask? Well, for starters, organic produce is often packed with more nutrients and tastes better, says Dr. Patil from the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth in Rahuri. Plus, it's kinder to the environment. No more chemical runoff polluting our rivers or harming the beneficial insects. Remember those fireflies we used to see as kids? Organic farming helps bring them back!", "normalised": "Why should we bother, you ask?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn’t a walk in the park. It requires patience, careful planning, and a bit of trial and error. Initially, yields might be a bit lower, and you might have to deal with more weeds and pests. But the long-term benefits – healthier soil, healthier food, and a healthier planet – are totally worth it. The initial investment might seem high, say around Rs. 50,000 for a 1-acre plot, but think of the savings on chemical fertilizers and pesticides!", "normalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn’t a walk in the park.
