Her journey hadn't been easy. A few years ago, she'd been completely reliant on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, just like her father and grandfather before her. Yields seemed good, initially. But the soil was degrading, and her input costs – buying fertilizers and pesticides from the local Ramanna Traders – were eating into her profits.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamala's back as she carefully inspected her tomato plants.
