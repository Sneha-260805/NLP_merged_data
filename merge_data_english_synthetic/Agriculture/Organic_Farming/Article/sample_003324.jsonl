{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, a system that prioritizes ecological balance and natural processes over synthetic inputs, is gaining significant traction in Indian agriculture. As concerns regarding environmental degradation and food safety rise, more farmers are exploring organic methods as a viable and sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices. This shift is driven by a growing consumer demand for pesticide-free and naturally grown produce.", "normalised": "Organic farming, a system that prioritizes ecological balance and natural processes over synthetic inputs, is gaining significant traction in Indian agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "The core principles of organic farming revolve around building healthy soil, conserving water, and promoting biodiversity. Instead of relying on chemical fertilizers, organic farmers in states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh enrich their soil with organic manures, compost, and green manure. Traditional practices like crop rotation and intercropping are also employed to enhance soil fertility and control pests naturally. For example, farmers in Kerala often use neem-based pesticides and cow dung manure, reflecting deeply rooted agricultural traditions.", "normalised": "The core principles of organic farming revolve around building healthy soil, conserving water, and promoting biodiversity.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major benefits of organic farming is its positive impact on the environment. It reduces pollution of water bodies and soil, while also conserving valuable resources. Furthermore, organic farming promotes biodiversity by providing habitats for beneficial insects, birds, and other wildlife. This contrasts sharply with conventional farming which can lead to soil erosion, water contamination from chemical runoff and a loss of biodiversity.", "normalised": "One of the major benefits of organic farming is its positive impact on the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Several institutions in India, including the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and state agricultural universities, are actively involved in research and development to support organic farming. Dr. Sharma, a leading researcher at the Punjab Agricultural University, has dedicated years to developing organic farming techniques suitable for the region's climate. Government initiatives like the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) are providing subsidies and support to farmers transitioning to organic practices. The scheme offers Rs. 50,000 per hectare over a period of three years for adopting organic methods.", "normalised": "Several institutions in India, including the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (I C A R) and state agricultural universities, are actively involved in research and development to support organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "While organic farming presents numerous advantages, challenges remain. One of the main hurdles is the lower initial yields often experienced during the transition period. Farmers may also face difficulties in sourcing organic inputs and accessing markets for their produce. The certification process, crucial for labeling produce as organic, can also be lengthy and expensive for small-scale farmers. The certification body APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) regulates organic standards for export.", "normalised": "While organic farming presents numerous advantages, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of organic farming far outweigh the drawbacks. The improved soil health, reduced input costs, and premium prices for organic produce make it an economically viable option for farmers. A study in Rajasthan showed that even with lower initial yields, farmers practicing organic farming earned a higher net profit per acre than those using conventional methods. The increasing awareness among consumers about the health benefits of organic food is further driving demand and supporting the growth of the organic sector. Many urban dwellers are even opting for terrace gardening in spaces as small as 100 sq ft, growing organic vegetables for their own consumption. Ultimately, organic farming represents a pathway towards a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system in India, ensuring food security while safeguarding the environment for future generations. The journey might be long, spanning across thousands of km, but the destination - a healthy and thriving agricultural landscape - is worth the effort.", "normalised": "Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of organic farming far outweigh the drawbacks.
