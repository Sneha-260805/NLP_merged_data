{"unnormalised": "Now, after 5 years, Kamala's farm is a thriving ecosystem. Butterflies flit through her flowering marigold plants, acting as natural pest repellents. Her yields, while still slightly lower than those achieved with chemical farming, are of significantly higher quality and fetch a better price at the local farmers market in Nasik. She sells her organic produce - plump tomatoes, vibrant spinach, and fragrant basmati rice - for Rs. 50 per kg more than conventionally grown produce. More importantly, her soil is alive again, teeming with beneficial microbes.", "normalised": "Now, after five years, Kamala's farm is a thriving ecosystem.
