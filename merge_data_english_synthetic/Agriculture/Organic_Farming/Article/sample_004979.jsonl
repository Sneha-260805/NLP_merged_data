Generations of her family had tilled this land, relying on the age-old wisdom passed down through whispers and lived experience.

She battled pests without the quick fix of pesticides, relying instead on neem oil sprays, companion planting (marigolds to deter nematodes!), and the ancient practice of using cow dung manure from her own cattle.", "normalised": "\"Initially, everyone thought I was crazy,\" Kamala chuckled, recalling the raised eyebrows and skeptical comments from her neighbours. \"They said organic was only for those with ancestral wealth, not for a farmer like me struggling to make ends meet.\" The first year was undeniably challenging.
