It was October, and the village of Palampur in Himachal Pradesh buzzed with the activity of the harvest season. But unlike her neighbors, whose fields reeked faintly of pesticides, Kamala's farm smelled earthy and sweet. She practiced organic farming, a conscious choice she'd made five years ago, influenced by a workshop conducted by Dr. Sharma from the CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamala's back as she carefully inspected her brinjal crop.

How will we earn enough to send Raju to Delhi for his engineering studies?\" he'd grumbled. The yields were lower in the first couple of years, that much was true. Where Ramlal’s conventionally farmed land yielded, say, 500 kg of wheat per acre, Kamala’s initially produced only 350 kg. But Kamala persisted, remembering Dr. Sharma’s words about long-term sustainability and the health benefits of chemical-free produce.", "normalised": "Initially, her family, especially her husband, Ramlal, had been skeptical. \"Organic?

She also learned about vermicomposting, converting kitchen waste and agricultural residue into nutrient-rich fertilizer.

She now sold her brinjals, tomatoes, and spinach for Rs. 20-30 more per kg than the chemically-grown alternatives.

The journey hadn't been easy, but the sweet taste of success, and the knowledge that she was contributing to a healthier environment, made it all worthwhile. Organic farming wasn’t just a farming method for her; it was a way of life, a return to the roots, a promise to the land and to future generations. The charkha, a symbol of self-reliance, spun silently in the corner of her courtyard, a reminder of the principles that guided her life. The gentle breeze carried the scent of marigolds, a testament to the bounty of nature and the wisdom of organic farming.", "normalised": "Ramlal, now a staunch supporter, proudly showed off their thriving vegetable patch. “See, Kamala was right,” he beamed. “Our son, Raju, is indeed in Delhi, and we are even saving for our daughter Priya’s wedding!” Kamala smiled, her face etched with satisfaction.
