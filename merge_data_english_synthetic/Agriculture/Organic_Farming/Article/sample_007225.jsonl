For generations, his family had tilled this very soil, coaxing forth bountiful harvests using the methods passed down to them. But something shifted about a decade ago. He saw the land growing weary, the yields dwindling despite the increasing doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. His expenses were shooting up, his profits shrinking, and the health of his family, particularly his grandchildren, seemed to be affected by the chemically laden produce.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Ramlal's face, a familiar warmth that had accompanied him for over forty years in the fields of his ancestral land in Rajasthan.

{"unnormalised": "One evening, sipping chai under the Neem tree with his friend, Govind, Ramlal heard about a workshop on organic farming conducted by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Jaipur. Govind, who had attended the workshop, spoke with passionate conviction about the benefits of returning to nature's ways. He talked about using cow dung manure (gobar khad), vermicompost, and natural pest repellents like neem oil. The idea of abandoning the familiar comfort of chemical fertilizers felt daunting, but Ramlal was desperate.", "normalised": "One evening, sipping chai under the Neem tree with his friend, Govind, Ramlal heard about a workshop on organic farming conducted by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Jaipur.

{"unnormalised": "He decided to take the plunge. With the help of experts from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), he started converting a small portion of his land, about 5000 sq ft, to organic practices. The initial months were challenging. The yields were lower, and he had to constantly monitor the fields for pests. But slowly, surely, he noticed a change. The soil became richer, teeming with earthworms. The crops, though smaller in size initially, were healthier and tastier. He used Jeevamrutham, a fermented concoction of cow dung, cow urine, jaggery, pulse flour, and soil, as a natural fertilizer.", "normalised": "He decided to take the plunge.

{"unnormalised": "Today, Ramlal cultivates his entire 5-acre farm using organic methods. His family’s health has improved significantly. He earns a better income now, selling his produce directly to consumers in Jaipur at a premium price. He even exports some of his speciality crops, like organic cumin and fenugreek, to buyers in Mumbai. He proudly displays the \"Jaivik Bharat\" organic certification on his products. The initial investment of Rs. 20,000 for setting up the vermicomposting unit and the ongoing operational costs are well offset by the increased profits and the satisfaction of cultivating healthy, sustainable food for his community. He often reflects on the journey, realising that going back to his roots, guided by modern knowledge, was the best decision he ever made. He now travels around Rajasthan, sharing his experience with other farmers, inspiring them to embrace organic farming, one field at a time. It's a slow journey, but for Ramlal, it's a journey worth taking, a return to the wisdom of the land.", "normalised": "Today, Ramlal cultivates his entire five-acre farm using organic methods.
