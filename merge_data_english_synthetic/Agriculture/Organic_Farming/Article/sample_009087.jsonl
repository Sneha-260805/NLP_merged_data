{"unnormalised": "Forget those harsh chemicals and synthetic fertilizers! Organic farming, in its essence, is about working *with* nature, not against it. Think of it as our dadi's (grandmother's) way of farming, but with a bit of modern science sprinkled in.

Plus, getting that organic certification from organizations like the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) can be a bit of a hassle. But the long-term gains? Worth it!
