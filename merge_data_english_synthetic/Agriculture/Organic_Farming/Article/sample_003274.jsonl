{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems, and people, is gaining significant traction in India. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity, and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. In a country like India, where agriculture is the backbone of the economy and the livelihood of millions like farmer Ramesh from Maharashtra, the importance of sustainable farming practices cannot be overstated.", "normalised": "Organic farming, a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems, and people, is gaining significant traction in India.

{"unnormalised": "The core principles of organic farming involve minimizing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, organic farmers like Mrs. Devi from Kerala employ techniques such as crop rotation, green manures, compost, and biological pest control. These practices not only improve soil health but also enhance the nutritional value of the crops produced. For instance, studies conducted at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi have demonstrated that organically grown produce often contains higher levels of antioxidants and vitamins compared to conventionally grown crops.", "normalised": "The core principles of organic farming involve minimizing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (G M O s).

{"unnormalised": "The transition to organic farming requires a significant shift in mindset and practices. Farmers need to learn new skills and techniques, adapt to changing climatic conditions, and often face initial yield reductions. Organizations like the National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF) in Ghaziabad play a vital role in providing training, certification, and support to farmers transitioning to organic methods. NCOF promotes schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), encouraging cluster-based organic farming and providing financial assistance to participating farmers, typically around Rs. 50,000 per hectare over 3 years.", "normalised": "The transition to organic farming requires a significant shift in mindset and practices.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain. One significant hurdle is the relatively lower yields in the initial years of conversion. Another is the higher cost of organic inputs like vermicompost. Market access and price premiums for organic produce are also crucial for the economic viability of organic farming. While consumer awareness is increasing, many consumers are still hesitant to pay the extra price for organic products.", "normalised": "Challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "However, the long-term benefits of organic farming are undeniable. Reduced environmental pollution, improved soil fertility, enhanced biodiversity, and healthier food are just some of the advantages. Moreover, organic farming can be particularly beneficial for small and marginal farmers in India, as it reduces their dependence on expensive external inputs and promotes self-sufficiency.", "normalised": "However, the long-term benefits of organic farming are undeniable.

{"unnormalised": "Successful organic farms like the one run by Dr. Sharma near Jaipur, Rajasthan, which spans over 10 acres (approximately 435,600 sq ft), serve as inspiration and demonstration sites for other farmers. He uses integrated farming systems, incorporating livestock and poultry to create a closed-loop system and reduce waste. He markets his produce directly to consumers through local farmers' markets, achieving significantly higher prices.", "normalised": "Successful organic farms like the one run by Doctor Sharma near Jaipur, Rajasthan, which spans over ten acres (approximately four hundred thirty five thousand six hundred square feet), serve as inspiration and demonstration sites for other farmers.
