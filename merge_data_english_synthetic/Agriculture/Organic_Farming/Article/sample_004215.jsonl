{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, simply put, is growing crops and raising livestock without using synthetic inputs. Think about it – our grandfathers didn't have access to all these chemicals, and they still managed to feed their families, right? They relied on natural methods like compost, manure, and crop rotation to keep their farms thriving.", "normalised": "Organic farming, simply put, is growing crops and raising livestock without using synthetic inputs.

{"unnormalised": "Now, why should a farmer like Ramlal from Rajasthan or Geeta Devi from Bihar consider making the switch? Well, for starters, organic produce fetches a better price in the market. Consumers are becoming more aware of the harmful effects of chemicals and are willing to pay extra for organic fruits and vegetables. Imagine selling your organic tomatoes for Rs. 50 per kg instead of Rs. 30! That's a big difference, especially for small landholders.", "normalised": "Now, why should a farmer like Ramlal from Rajasthan or Geeta Devi from Bihar consider making the switch?

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, organic farming is better for the environment. Chemical fertilizers can contaminate our water sources and damage the soil structure. Organic methods, on the other hand, improve soil fertility and water retention. Plus, they promote biodiversity – attracting beneficial insects and pollinators to your farm.", "normalised": "Secondly, organic farming is better for the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn't a cakewalk. It takes time and effort. You need to build up your soil health, learn about natural pest control methods, and be prepared for lower yields in the initial years. Institutions like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) are doing some fantastic work providing training and support to farmers who want to go organic. They even have schemes that provide subsidies and incentives to help you get started.", "normalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn't a cakewalk. It takes time and effort.
