{"unnormalised": "Think about it. Our ancestors in villages like Krishnapur, Bihar, weren’t spraying their fields with chemicals imported from who-knows-where. They used cow dung (gomaya), compost, and crop rotation. This not only kept their crops healthy, but also enriched the soil for future harvests. Now, many farmers like Ramesh bhai down the street are rediscovering these traditional methods.", "normalised": "Think about it.

{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *is* organic farming? In a nutshell, it’s about growing food without using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, we rely on natural processes like composting, using beneficial insects (like our friendly ladybugs), and employing techniques like intercropping (planting different crops together). It's like a whole ecosystem working in harmony!", "normalised": "So, what exactly *is* organic farming?

{"unnormalised": "For instance, instead of spraying pesticides on your brinjal (baingan) plants, you could introduce ladybugs that eat the aphids. Or, instead of relying solely on chemical fertilizers, you can enrich the soil with vermicompost made from earthworms. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is doing some amazing work on promoting vermicomposting across the country.", "normalised": "For instance, instead of spraying pesticides on your brinjal (baingan) plants, you could introduce ladybugs that eat the aphids.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits? Plenty! Organically grown food is generally considered to be healthier, containing fewer pesticide residues. Plus, organic farming practices are much better for the environment, promoting biodiversity and reducing soil erosion. My neighbour, Shanti didi, converted her 2000 sq ft plot to organic farming and says her soil has never been healthier!", "normalised": "The benefits? Plenty!

{"unnormalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't always easy. It can be more labour-intensive than conventional farming, and yields may be lower in the initial years. But with the right knowledge and techniques, the long-term benefits far outweigh the challenges. Many state agriculture universities, like the one in Pantnagar, offer courses and workshops on organic farming techniques.", "normalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't always easy.

{"unnormalised": "And let’s not forget the economic aspect. While organic produce often fetches a higher price in the market (think Rs. 80/kg for organic tomatoes compared to Rs. 40/kg), the initial investment in organic inputs can be significant. Government schemes like the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) offer financial assistance to farmers who want to adopt organic farming practices. Dr. Patil, the agriculture officer in my block, encourages everyone to check them out!", "normalised": "And let’s not forget the economic aspect.
