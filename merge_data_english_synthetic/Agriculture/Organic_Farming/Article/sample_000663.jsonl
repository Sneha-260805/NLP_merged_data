{"unnormalised": "So, agriculture, right? We all know it's the backbone of India. But lately, there’s been this buzz around \"organic farming.\" What's the big deal, you ask? Well, imagine dadi’s garden, full of flavourful tomatoes and sweet mangoes, all grown without a single chemical fertilizer in sight. That's the essence of organic farming, folks.", "normalised": "So, agriculture, right? We all know it's the backbone of India.

{"unnormalised": "It's basically farming the old-fashioned way, like our ancestors used to before all these fancy chemical fertilizers and pesticides came into the picture. We're talking about using natural methods to grow crops – composting, manure, crop rotation… you know, the whole shebang.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what some of you are thinking: \"But will it produce enough?\" That’s a valid concern. Initially, yields might be a bit lower. But over time, the soil health improves, and the output stabilizes, often exceeding conventional farming yields in the long run. Plus, the quality of the produce is usually much better! Imagine selling those fragrant Basmati rice grains grown in your organic farm near Dehradun at a premium price in Mumbai! Cha-ching!", "normalised": "Now, I know what some of you are thinking: \"But will it produce enough?\" That’s a valid concern. Initially, yields might be a bit lower.

And let's not forget about the biodiversity – organic farms tend to attract more beneficial insects and birds, creating a healthier ecosystem.

{"unnormalised": "Okay, so it's not always easy. Organic farming requires more labour and a deeper understanding of natural processes. You gotta be patient and willing to learn. We're talking about creating your own organic pesticides using neem leaves and cow urine! Sounds crazy, right? But it works! And let's not forget about weed control – manual weeding is often necessary, especially in the initial stages.", "normalised": "Okay, so it's not always easy.

{"unnormalised": "But think of the long-term benefits: healthier soil that can sequester more carbon, reduced reliance on expensive chemical inputs, and healthier produce that you can sell at a higher price. A farmer in my village, Ramesh Bhai, converted his 500 sq ft plot to organic farming last year and he is already seeing the difference. He sells his organic produce directly at the local haat for Rs. 50/kg more than conventional produce.", "normalised": "But think of the long-term benefits: healthier soil that can sequester more carbon, reduced reliance on expensive chemical inputs, and healthier produce that you can sell at a higher price.

It might cost a bit more, but you're investing in your health and supporting farmers who are working to protect our environment.
