Mr. Patil, with his lush green fields, would often scoff, \"Organic farming is for dreamers, Govind. You’ll never make a decent living!\" But Govind persevered. He learned to make jeevamrutham, a concoction of cow dung, cow urine, jaggery, and flour, a powerful organic fertilizer. He also introduced companion planting, intercropping marigolds to deter nematodes, a common pest in his tomato crop. He used neem oil, a natural insecticide readily available in any Indian household, to combat aphids.", "normalised": "Initially, the transition was tough.

He hopes his success story will inspire other farmers to embrace organic farming and build a healthier and more sustainable future for India.
