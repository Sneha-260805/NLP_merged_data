{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, a system that relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, is gaining significant traction in India. In contrast to conventional agriculture which heavily depends on synthetic inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, organic methods emphasize natural alternatives, aiming to produce safe and nutritious food while minimizing environmental impact.", "normalised": "Organic farming, a system that relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, is gaining significant traction in India.

{"unnormalised": "The principles of organic farming are deeply rooted in traditional Indian agricultural practices. Concepts like crop rotation, green manure, and the use of indigenous seeds were commonplace for centuries. Today, the resurgence of interest in these methods is driven by concerns about the long-term effects of chemical-intensive farming on soil health, water resources, and human health.", "normalised": "The principles of organic farming are deeply rooted in traditional Indian agricultural practices.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. K.N. Singh, a leading agricultural scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi, emphasizes the importance of building soil fertility in organic systems. He states, \"Healthy soil is the foundation of organic farming. By using compost, vermicompost, and other organic amendments, we can improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the reliance on external inputs.\" Many farmers, like Ramesh Kumar from Rajasthan, are using cow dung and Panchagavya, a traditional Indian preparation of cow products, to enrich their soil and control pests naturally.", "normalised": "Doctor K.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of organic farming are numerous. Studies have shown that organically grown produce often has higher levels of certain vitamins and antioxidants. Moreover, organic farming practices help conserve water, reduce soil erosion, and promote biodiversity. For instance, farms practicing organic methods near the Ganga river basin are helping to reduce the amount of harmful chemicals entering the water supply.", "normalised": "The benefits of organic farming are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges do exist, however. Organic farming typically requires more labor and can sometimes result in lower yields in the initial years. The cost of organic certification can also be a barrier for smallholder farmers. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) plays a vital role in promoting organic certification in India, offering subsidies and technical assistance to farmers transitioning to organic methods.", "normalised": "Challenges do exist, however.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, access to reliable markets and fair prices is crucial for the success of organic farmers. Organic produce often fetches a premium price, but farmers need to be connected to buyers who are willing to pay for the added value. Farmer producer organizations (FPOs) are playing a key role in aggregating organic produce and connecting farmers directly to consumers.", "normalised": "Furthermore, access to reliable markets and fair prices is crucial for the success of organic farmers.

{"unnormalised": "The government of India is actively promoting organic farming through schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which encourages cluster-based organic farming and provides financial assistance to farmers. Many individuals are also adopting organic gardening at home, growing vegetables and herbs in their backyards or on rooftops. A typical home garden may cover an area of 200 sq ft.", "normalised": "The government of India is actively promoting organic farming through schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (P K V Y), which encourages cluster-based organic farming and provides financial assistance to farmers.

{"unnormalised": "Organic farming is not merely a farming technique; it's a philosophy that embraces sustainability and respect for nature. While challenges remain, the potential of organic farming to transform Indian agriculture and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future is undeniable. The transition may require initial investment of around Rs. 50000 per hectare, but the long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs.", "normalised": "Organic farming is not merely a farming technique; it's a philosophy that embraces sustainability and respect for nature.
