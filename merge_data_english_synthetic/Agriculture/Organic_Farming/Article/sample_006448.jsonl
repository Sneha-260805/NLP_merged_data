{"unnormalised": "What exactly is organic farming? Well, it's all about growing crops and raising livestock without using synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Think natural fertilizers like cow dung (Gobar) from Lakshmi, our beloved cow, and using neem oil instead of some fancy pesticide. My grandfather, Nana ji, always said, \"Nature has the answers, beta!\" and he was right.", "normalised": "What exactly is organic farming?

{"unnormalised": "Here in India, organic farming is gaining serious traction. More and more farmers, like Mr. Sharma from Maharashtra, are ditching conventional methods and embracing the organic route. They're finding that while the initial yields might be slightly lower, the long-term benefits for the soil health and consumer health are immense. Plus, the demand for organic produce in cities like Delhi and Mumbai is booming, meaning better prices for farmers.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses. Organic farming requires a lot more manual labor and careful planning. You can’t just spray a chemical and hope for the best. Weeds are the biggest headache! But clever farmers use techniques like crop rotation, companion planting (think tulsi near your tomatoes!), and natural weed control methods to keep them at bay.", "normalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses.

{"unnormalised": "Even if you're not a farmer, you can support organic farming by buying organic produce whenever possible. Look for the \"India Organic\" logo. It's a bit more expensive, sure, maybe Rs. 20 extra per kg, but think of it as an investment in your health and the environment. You can even start small with a home garden on your balcony, maybe 100 sq ft, growing your own organic herbs and vegetables.", "normalised": "Even if you're not a farmer, you can support organic farming by buying organic produce whenever possible.

Let's make Bharat a land of healthy soil, healthy crops, and healthy people, one organic farm at a time! Dr. Patel would be proud! He spent his life advocating for this at the Anand Agricultural University. Think of the benefits to places like Uttarakhand known for their serene beauty. Less pesticide runoff keeps the Ganga cleaner too! Let's embrace this change, eh?", "normalised": "So, next time you're at the Sabzi Mandi, remember Nana ji's words and consider choosing organic.
