{"unnormalised": "Think about it: grandma’s kitchen garden! She probably used compost made from kitchen scraps and cow dung (gobar), right? That’s the essence of organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses. Transitioning to organic farming can be tough. Initially, yields might be lower, and it takes time to build up healthy soil. The certification process can also be a bit of a headache with paperwork and inspections. Plus, organic produce can be pricier, putting it out of reach for some consumers. For instance, a kilo of organic dal might cost Rs. 150 compared to Rs. 80 for the regular stuff. But Dr. Patil, an agricultural scientist at IARI, Pusa, believes that with government support and consumer awareness, organic farming can become more mainstream.
