{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, simply put, is farming without any synthetic inputs. Forget about the urea and those fancy-sounding pesticides from multinational companies. Instead, we’re talking cow dung manure, compost made from kitchen scraps (yeah, those leftover roti pieces!), and natural pest control methods. Think neem oil, folks – the age-old remedy for everything from skin problems to crop protection!", "normalised": "Organic farming, simply put, is farming without any synthetic inputs.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in Delhi, gave a fantastic talk on this. He mentioned how organic farming, while requiring more initial investment in soil building and learning new techniques, can be much more sustainable in the long run. Plus, the demand for organic produce is skyrocketing, especially in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore. People are willing to pay a premium for pesticide-free food, which means potentially higher profits for us.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I A R I) in Delhi, gave a fantastic talk on this.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Will my yields drop, yaar?\" Initially, maybe. It takes time for the soil to recover and for the natural ecosystem to get established. But with proper techniques like crop rotation (mixing up your crops) and companion planting (growing beneficial plants together), you can actually improve your soil health and boost yields over time. Think planting marigolds around your tomatoes – a classic desi trick!", "normalised": "Now, I know what you are thinking: \"Will my yields drop, yaar?\" Initially, maybe.

{"unnormalised": "My neighbor, Ramlal, has been practicing organic farming on his 5000 sq ft plot for the past 3 years. He grows everything from tomatoes and brinjals to leafy greens like palak and methi.
