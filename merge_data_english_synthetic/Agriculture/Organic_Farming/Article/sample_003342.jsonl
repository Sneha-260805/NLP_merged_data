{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, a method emphasizing ecological harmony and biodiversity, is gaining significant traction in India as farmers and consumers alike seek healthier and more sustainable agricultural practices. Unlike conventional farming, which relies heavily on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, organic farming prioritizes natural inputs and traditional techniques. This approach not only promises healthier produce but also fosters long-term soil health and environmental resilience.", "normalised": "Organic farming, a method emphasizing ecological harmony and biodiversity, is gaining significant traction in India as farmers and consumers alike seek healthier and more sustainable agricultural practices.

{"unnormalised": "In the Indian context, organic farming resonates deeply with the country's rich agricultural heritage, where practices like crop rotation, composting (using inputs like cow dung – gobar), and the use of bio-pesticides (like neem oil) have been integral for centuries. States like Sikkim, which declared itself fully organic in 2016, serve as inspiring examples of the viability and benefits of large-scale organic agriculture.", "normalised": "In the Indian context, organic farming resonates deeply with the country's rich agricultural heritage, where practices like crop rotation, composting (using inputs like cow dung – gobar), and the use of bio-pesticides (like neem oil) have been integral for centuries.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of organic farming methods involves a shift in mindset and practice. Farmers like Mr. Ramesh Sharma in Haryana are increasingly adopting integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, using beneficial insects to control pests rather than relying on harmful chemicals. He cultivates basmati rice and wheat on his 5-acre farm using organic methods, reporting a significant improvement in soil fertility over the past 5 years. Similarly, Dr. Anjali Patel, a professor at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in Delhi, is researching the efficacy of various organic fertilizers and bio-inoculants for enhancing crop yields.", "normalised": "The adoption of organic farming methods involves a shift in mindset and practice.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental sustainability. Studies have shown that organically grown produce often contains higher levels of nutrients and antioxidants compared to conventionally grown food. Furthermore, the reduced exposure to harmful chemicals can lead to improved health outcomes for both farmers and consumers. Organic farming also promotes biodiversity, creating healthier ecosystems and supporting a wider range of plant and animal life.", "normalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental sustainability.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The initial transition to organic farming can sometimes lead to lower yields, requiring farmers to invest in training and new techniques. Market access for organic produce can also be limited, particularly in rural areas. Government initiatives, such as the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), aim to address these challenges by providing financial assistance and technical support to farmers adopting organic practices. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) also plays a crucial role in promoting the export of Indian organic products.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Certification is another crucial aspect of organic farming. Agencies like the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) provide accreditation to organic certification bodies, ensuring that products labeled as organic meet specific standards. Farmers seeking certification must adhere to stringent guidelines and undergo regular inspections.", "normalised": "Certification is another crucial aspect of organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "For instance, a farmer in Kerala cultivating spices organically on a 1000 sq ft plot might require an investment of Rs. 20,000 for initial setup and certification, but can expect higher market prices for his produce, often fetching Rs. 50-100 more per kg compared to conventionally grown spices.", "normalised": "For instance, a farmer in Kerala cultivating spices organically on a one thousand square feet plot might require an investment of rupees twenty thousand for initial setup and certification, but can expect higher market prices for his produce, often fetching rupees fifty to one hundred more per kilogram compared to conventionally grown spices."}
{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the future of Indian agriculture hinges on embracing sustainable practices like organic farming. By prioritizing ecological harmony and supporting farmers in their transition to organic methods, India can pave the way for a healthier and more resilient agricultural system, benefiting both present and future generations.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the future of Indian agriculture hinges on embracing sustainable practices like organic farming.
