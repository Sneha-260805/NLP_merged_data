Generations of his family had toiled on this land, but Kamal, armed with a B.Sc. in Agriculture from Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, wanted to do things differently. He dreamt of organic farming, a stark contrast to the chemical-laden practices that had become commonplace.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamal's back as he surveyed his ancestral farm in Maharashtra, near the foothills of the Sahyadri.
