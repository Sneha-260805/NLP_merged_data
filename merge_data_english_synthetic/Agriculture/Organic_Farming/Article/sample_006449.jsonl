{"unnormalised": "So, you've probably heard the buzz – organic farming is the new cool kid on the block, right? But trust me, it's more than just a trend. It's about going back to how our grandparents, like Dadi and Nana in our villages, used to cultivate before all these chemical fertilizers and pesticides came along. Think good old cow dung manure, crop rotation, and keeping the soil healthy, naturally!", "normalised": "So, you've probably heard the buzz – organic farming is the new cool kid on the block, right?

{"unnormalised": "What's the big deal, you ask? Well, for starters, organic produce is, in my opinion, tastier and definitely healthier. No dodgy chemicals getting into your system, bhai! Plus, it's way better for the environment. No runoff polluting the rivers like the Ganga, and healthier soil means more carbon sequestration, which helps fight climate change. Win-win, right?", "normalised": "What's the big deal, you ask? Well, for starters, organic produce is, in my opinion, tastier and definitely healthier.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you might be thinking: \"Organic farming is too expensive and low yield, yaar.\" And yeah, there might be a bit of a transition period. It takes time for the soil to recover and for the farm to establish its own natural ecosystem. But in the long run, organic farming can be just as profitable, if not more. Farmers like Mr. Sharma from Haryana are proving that everyday! They use techniques like intercropping (planting different crops together) and vermicomposting (using worms to make awesome fertilizer) to boost yields and reduce costs.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you might be thinking: \"Organic farming is too expensive and low yield, yaar.\" And yeah, there might be a bit of a transition period.
