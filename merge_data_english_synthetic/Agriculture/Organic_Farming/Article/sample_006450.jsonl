Forget the fancy chemicals and synthetic fertilizers – we're talking about farming the way our grandmothers and grandfathers did it, back in the day.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, organic farming is all about working *with* nature, not against it. Instead of nuking pests with harmful chemicals, we use natural methods like crop rotation, composting, and introducing beneficial insects. My friend, Rohan, who has a small farm near Pune, swears by it. He uses neem oil for pest control – it's an age-old remedy!", "normalised": "Basically, organic farming is all about working with nature, not against it.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But is it efficient? Can it feed our growing population?\" Well, the truth is, yields might be a bit lower initially compared to conventional farming, but the quality of the produce is significantly higher. Plus, the soil health improves dramatically over time. Rohan's seen a massive increase in earthworm activity on his farm, which is a great sign of healthy soil. He even started a small vermicomposting unit with the help of Dr. Sharma from the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But is it efficient?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of which, there are tons of resources available to help farmers transition to organic methods. NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) offers various schemes and subsidies to encourage organic farming practices. And let's not forget the importance of traditional knowledge.

They're gold, I tell you!", "normalised": "Speaking of which, there are tons of resources available to help farmers transition to organic methods.

{"unnormalised": "The demand for organic produce is definitely on the rise in India, especially in urban areas. People are becoming more aware of the health risks associated with conventionally grown food, and they're willing to pay a premium for organic options. Which means, farmers like Rohan can actually earn more, even if their yields are slightly lower. He sells his organic vegetables at a weekly farmer's market in Mumbai and makes a decent profit. He even uses a small plot of around 500 sq ft for growing medicinal herbs.", "normalised": "The demand for organic produce is definitely on the rise in India, especially in urban areas.

Supporting organic farmers is a small step we can all take towards a healthier and more sustainable India. Costs might be slightly higher, maybe Rs. 20-30 extra per kg for tomatoes, but think of it as an investment in your health and the environment. Let's ditch the chemical-laden stuff and go back to our roots, one organic vegetable at a time! Jai Kisan!", "normalised": "So next time you're at the market, look for that \"Jaivik Bharat\" logo, indicating certified organic produce.
