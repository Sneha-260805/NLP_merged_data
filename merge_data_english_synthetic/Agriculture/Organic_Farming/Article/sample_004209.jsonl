It’s all about working *with* nature, not against it, to grow food that’s healthy for us and good for the planet. Think of it as a return to our roots, a sustainable way to feed Bharat Mata.", "normalised": "Hey Kisan Bhaiyon and Behno! Remember dadi’s stories about farming before all the chemicals came along?

These not only enrich the soil with essential nutrients but also improve its structure and water-holding capacity.

{"unnormalised": "Pest control in organic farming isn’t about spraying harsh pesticides that kill everything in sight. Instead, farmers use techniques like crop rotation, companion planting (think marigolds amongst your tomatoes – pretty *and* effective!), and introducing beneficial insects like ladybugs to keep the bad bugs in check. Even solutions based on Neem oil, a good old Ayurvedic remedy, are quite popular and effective.", "normalised": "Pest control in organic farming isn’t about spraying harsh pesticides that kill everything in sight.

{"unnormalised": "Organic farming isn’t just about what you *don’t* use, it’s also about what you *do* use. Traditional Indian breeds of cows, like the Gir cow, play a vital role, providing that precious cow dung and urine which are the cornerstones of organic fertilizers and pest control. Even the waste products from the kitchen, like vegetable peels, can be composted and added back to the soil. Talk about zero waste!", "normalised": "Organic farming isn’t just about what you don’t use, it’s also about what you do use.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Organic farming requires more knowledge, more labor, and often yields slightly lower in the initial years. Plus, getting organic certification can be a bit of a hassle. But the benefits are immense. You get healthier food, a healthier planet, and a better price for your produce in markets like Dilli Haat or even export it.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Organizations like Navdanya, founded by Dr. Vandana Shiva, are doing amazing work promoting organic farming and protecting our traditional seeds. Even small farmers with land of 1000 sq ft can start practicing organic methods in their kitchen gardens. The future of agriculture in India is organic, and it's up to us to embrace it. So let's ditch the chemicals and embrace the wisdom of our ancestors. Jai Kisan! Let's make Bharat a Vishwa Guru in sustainable agriculture. And Yes, subsidies are provided by the government; reach out to your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra to know more. The cost for certification can range from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000, depending on the land size and agency.", "normalised": "Organizations like Navdanya, founded by Doctor Vandana Shiva, are doing amazing work promoting organic farming and protecting our traditional seeds.
