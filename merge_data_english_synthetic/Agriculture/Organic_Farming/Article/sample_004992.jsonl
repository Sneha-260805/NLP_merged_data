She sells her produce at the local farmers market, earning a premium price for her organically grown goods. She’s expanded her operation, adding a 500 sq ft greenhouse for growing seedlings. And most importantly, she's debt-free and healthy, a proud organic farmer carrying on the legacy of Dada Patil. She even trains other farmers in Akola, sharing her knowledge and helping them transition to organic farming.
