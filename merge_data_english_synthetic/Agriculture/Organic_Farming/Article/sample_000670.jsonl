Organic farming, basically, is like what our grandfathers did – working *with* nature, not against it.

{"unnormalised": "It's all about building healthy soil. That's the foundation, right? Healthy soil means healthy plants, which means healthy people eating them! We're talking about practices like crop rotation - maybe bajra after groundnuts - to keep the soil nutrient levels up and pests confused. Then there's composting – turning all that farm waste into black gold for your fields. Even covering the soil with organic mulch helps retain moisture and suppresses weeds. Imagine, fewer trips to the well and less back-breaking weeding!", "normalised": "It's all about building healthy soil. That's the foundation, right?
