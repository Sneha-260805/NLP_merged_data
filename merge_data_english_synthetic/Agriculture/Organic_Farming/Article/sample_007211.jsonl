She attended workshops on organic farming techniques conducted by the Navdanya organization, learning about crop rotation, companion planting, and natural pest control. She learned how to make Neem-based pesticides and other organic solutions. Gradually, her yields started to improve. More importantly, the quality of her produce – tomatoes, brinjal, okra, and various leafy greens – was noticeably superior. People from nearby Pune started seeking her out, willing to pay a premium for her organically grown vegetables.", "normalised": "However, Kamala persevered.

She employs two local women and inspires other farmers in Shivapur to consider transitioning to organic methods. She proves that Ramchandra’s wisdom was right. Her journey hasn't been easy, but she knows that she is not just farming; she is nurturing the land for future generations.
