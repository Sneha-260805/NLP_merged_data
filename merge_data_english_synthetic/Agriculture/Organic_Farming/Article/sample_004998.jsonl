Generations of his family had tilled this land in the heart of Rajasthan, growing millet and pulses the traditional way. But things were changing. He remembered his grandfather, a man as weathered as the ancient banyan tree at the edge of the field, telling stories of the land’s bounty. Lately, the yields had dwindled, the soil seemed tired, despite the chemical fertilizers readily available.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Ramlal's face, a familiar warmth that had kissed his skin for over fifty years.

Buyers from Jaipur were willing to pay a premium for the chemical-free produce. Ramlal, tasting the sweetness of his organic tomatoes, felt a deep satisfaction he hadn’t experienced in years. He realized that organic farming wasn’t about going back in time; it was about looking forward, to a healthier and more sustainable future for his land and his family. The banyan tree, a silent witness to generations of farming, seemed to rustle its leaves in approval, a gentle breeze carrying the promise of a bountiful harvest to come. Vijay smiled, knowing this was just the beginning of a long and fruitful journey, a journey back to the roots of Indian agriculture, but with the wisdom of modern science guiding the way.", "normalised": "The first harvest was a revelation.
