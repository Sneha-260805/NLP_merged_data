There were naysayers who dismissed organic farming as impractical and unprofitable. But Kamala persisted. She learned about crop rotation, using cow dung and compost as natural fertilizers, and neem-based concoctions to ward off pests. Dr. Sharma, a soil scientist from the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra, became a mentor, guiding her through the complexities of soil health and pest management.", "normalised": "Her journey hasn’t been without its challenges.

She now conducts workshops for other farmers, sharing her knowledge and inspiring them to embrace organic practices. The future, she believes, lies in nurturing the earth, not exploiting it. Her success is a testament to the enduring wisdom of traditional Indian farming practices, adapted and enhanced with modern scientific understanding. The aroma of organically grown turmeric drying in the sun, is, for Kamala, the sweet smell of progress and sustainability.", "normalised": "More importantly, Kamala takes immense pride in knowing that she’s contributing to a healthier environment and providing nutritious food to her community.
