Dust devils danced across the dry earth, a stark reminder of the challenges faced by farmers in this part of Karnataka. Kamala, however, was undeterred.

Gradually, the land began to respond. The soil, once hard and compacted, became more porous and alive with earthworms. Her yields, while still lower than Mr. Reddy's chemically-boosted crops, were improving steadily.", "normalised": "She started using Jeevamrutham, a fermented concoction of cow dung, cow urine, jaggery, and gram flour, to rejuvenate her soil.

She is also deeply involved in the local women's self-help group, training other women farmers in organic techniques. \"We're showing them that organic farming isn't just about reducing costs; it's about investing in our future, ensuring that our children have access to healthy food and a healthy planet,\" she explains.

Kamala envisions a future where organic farming isn't a niche practice, but the norm. A future where farmers are valued not just for the quantity of their produce, but also for the quality of their stewardship of the land. It's a long journey, but Kamala, armed with her grandfather's wisdom and a deep connection to the earth, is determined to see it through.
