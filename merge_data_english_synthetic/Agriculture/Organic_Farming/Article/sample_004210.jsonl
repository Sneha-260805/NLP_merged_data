It's called organic farming, and it's gaining serious traction here in Bharat. Basically, it’s all about farming with nature, not against it.", "normalised": "Hey Kisan friends!

They used cow dung manure (Gobar ki Khad), crop rotation, and natural pest control methods.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the big deal? Well, for starters, organic farming is way better for our health. No nasty chemicals leaching into our veggies and fruits! Plus, it's kinder to the environment. Chemical fertilizers can pollute our rivers and streams, like the Ganga, and harm beneficial insects. Organic methods, on the other hand, help build healthy soil, which is vital for long-term agricultural sustainability. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in Pusa, New Delhi, is doing some amazing research on organic farming techniques suitable for Indian conditions.", "normalised": "So, what's the big deal?

But now, his soil is healthier, his crops are more resistant to pests, and he's getting a better price for his produce at the local mandi. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic food because they know it's better for them.", "normalised": "Take, for example, my friend Ramesh, a farmer in Maharashtra.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't a walk in the park. It requires more effort and knowledge. Farmers need to learn about composting, using bio-pesticides, and managing weeds without herbicides. Dr. Sharma, an agricultural expert I met at a Kisan Mela, emphasized the importance of proper soil testing and selecting crop varieties suitable for organic cultivation.", "normalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't a walk in the park.

{"unnormalised": "There are challenges, like access to reliable organic inputs and the certification process, which can be a bit cumbersome and costly, around Rs. 5000-Rs. 10,000 for a small farm.
