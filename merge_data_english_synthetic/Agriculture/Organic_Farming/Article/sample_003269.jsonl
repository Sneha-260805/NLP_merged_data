{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, a holistic agricultural system, emphasizes ecological balance and biodiversity over synthetic inputs. It's gaining traction across India, from the fertile plains of Punjab to the hilly terrains of Himachal Pradesh, as farmers like Mr. Sharma in Rajasthan seek sustainable alternatives to conventional practices. This approach prioritizes soil health, crop rotation, and natural pest control, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.", "normalised": "Organic farming, a holistic agricultural system, emphasizes ecological balance and biodiversity over synthetic inputs.

{"unnormalised": "The core principles of organic farming include building healthy soil through composting, green manure, and cover crops. Crop rotation, a common practice in regions like Tamil Nadu, involves planting different crops sequentially to improve soil fertility and break pest cycles. For instance, alternating legumes with cereals can naturally fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.", "normalised": "The core principles of organic farming include building healthy soil through composting, green manure, and cover crops.

{"unnormalised": "Natural pest control is another cornerstone. Instead of relying on harmful pesticides, organic farmers employ strategies like introducing beneficial insects, using botanical pesticides like neem oil (a common practice in Kerala), and physically removing pests. Farmers like Ms. Devi in Uttar Pradesh have found that companion planting, where certain plants are grown together to deter pests or attract beneficial insects, is a particularly effective technique.", "normalised": "Natural pest control is another cornerstone.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental protection. Organic produce often commands a higher market price, providing farmers with increased income. Studies conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) show that while initial yields may be slightly lower, the long-term sustainability and reduced input costs make organic farming economically viable. Furthermore, organic produce is perceived by consumers as being healthier and safer, driving demand in urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi.", "normalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental protection.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, however. Transitioning to organic farming requires significant investment in training, infrastructure, and certification. Obtaining organic certification, often through agencies like APEDA, can be a lengthy and expensive process for smallholder farmers.

{"unnormalised": "The shift towards organic farming is not merely a trend; it's a necessary step towards ensuring food security and environmental sustainability in India. By embracing traditional knowledge combined with modern techniques, farmers can create resilient and profitable agricultural systems that benefit both people and the planet. Imagine a future where fields, spanning acres (approx. 43,560 sq ft per acre), are teeming with life, nurtured by natural processes, and yielding healthy, nutritious food for all. This vision requires concerted effort from farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers alike, requiring investments to the tune of Rs. 5,000 per hectare in initial stages, along with continued support from institutions such as Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University in Pusa, Bihar. The transition may require travelling distances of 20-30 km for resources and training.", "normalised": "The shift towards organic farming is not merely a trend; it is a necessary step towards ensuring food security and environmental sustainability in India.
