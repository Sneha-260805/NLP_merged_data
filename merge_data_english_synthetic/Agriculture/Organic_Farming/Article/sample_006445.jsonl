It’s basically farming the old-school way, the way our grandfathers and grandmothers in villages like Ramnagar used to do it, before all these fancy (and often harmful) chemicals took over.", "normalised": "Namaste folks!

Instead of blasting the fields with chemicals that kill everything in sight (including the good bugs!), organic farmers rely on things like crop rotation, composting, and good old-fashioned elbow grease to keep their crops thriving.", "normalised": "Think about it: healthy soil, happy plants, and ultimately, healthy us!

That \"gobbar\" your village might be famous for is packed with nutrients and beneficial bacteria that make the soil sing. And instead of using chemical pesticides, organic farmers might use things like neem oil (naturally derived from the neem tree) or introduce beneficial insects that prey on the pests. It’s all about creating a balanced ecosystem.", "normalised": "One of the biggest heroes of organic farming is cow dung. Yes, you read that right!

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Organic stuff is so expensive!” And you’re not wrong. Organic produce often costs more because it requires more labor and careful management. But think of it as an investment in your health and the health of the planet. Plus, the demand for organic products is growing rapidly, so farmers who switch to organic practices can often command a premium price for their goods. Mr. Patel from Gujarat, for example, switched to organic farming on his 5 acre farm and now sells his produce for Rs. 50/kg more than his conventionally grown produce.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Organic stuff is so expensive!” And you’re not wrong.

Even a small contribution helps support farmers who are working hard to grow healthy, sustainable food for us. Even if you have just a small balcony garden (say 100 sq ft), you can experiment with organic gardening techniques! It's a win-win for everyone!", "normalised": "So, next time you’re at the market, consider buying organic. Look for certification labels like India Organic.
