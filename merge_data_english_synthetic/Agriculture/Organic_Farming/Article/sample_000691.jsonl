{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *is* organic farming? Simply put, it's farming without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Think Grandma's garden, but on a larger scale. Instead of relying on chemical cocktails, organic farmers use natural methods like composting, crop rotation, and even introducing beneficial insects to keep pests in check. Remember how Dad used to swear by neem oil for everything? That's the spirit!", "normalised": "So, what exactly *is* organic farming?

{"unnormalised": "But it's not all sunshine and roses, of course. Organic farming can be more labor-intensive and initially yields might be lower.
