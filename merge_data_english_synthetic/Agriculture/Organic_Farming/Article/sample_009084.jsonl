They knew the land, the seasons, and how to grow healthy crops using natural methods. And guess what? That's essentially what organic farming is all about – a return to those tried-and-tested principles.", "normalised": "For generations, our grandfathers and grandmothers, like Dadi from my village in Rajasthan, farmed without all the fancy (and often scary) stuff we see nowadays.

Dr. Patil from the Agricultural University of Maharashtra told us during a recent Krishi Mela that the yield might be a little lower at first while the soil recovers its natural vitality. But, he emphasized, the long-term benefits are immense. We're talking about healthier crops, reduced exposure to harmful chemicals for both farmers and consumers, and a more sustainable future for our farmlands.", "normalised": "Of course, switching to organic isn't a walk in the park, especially in the initial stages.

Let’s learn from each other, share our experiences, and build a future where farming works in harmony with nature. Who knows, maybe someday we can all afford to buy organic mangoes grown right here in Bharat, and not have to pay Rs. 200 per kg for something imported! Think of the potential for our nation's health and economy! Let's connect with experts at institutions like the ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) and see how they can help. Jai Kisan!", "normalised": "So, let's get our hands dirty and explore the world of organic farming.
