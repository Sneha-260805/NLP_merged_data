{"unnormalised": "The core principles of organic farming revolve around minimizing the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, it emphasizes soil health management through practices like crop rotation, composting (vermicompost using earthworms is particularly popular), and the use of green manures. This approach not only improves soil fertility but also enhances water retention, crucial in regions facing water scarcity.", "normalised": "The core principles of organic farming revolve around minimizing the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms (G M O s).

{"unnormalised": "Several institutions in India are actively promoting organic farming. The National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF), Ghaziabad, plays a vital role in research, training, and certification. Agricultural universities like the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) are conducting research on organic pest control and developing bio-fertilizers suitable for Indian conditions. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), a government scheme, encourages cluster-based organic farming and provides financial assistance to farmers transitioning to organic practices.", "normalised": "Several institutions in India are actively promoting organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "One significant advantage of organic farming is its reduced environmental footprint. By avoiding synthetic pesticides, it protects beneficial insects like honeybees, crucial for pollination. The use of organic fertilizers minimizes the risk of water pollution, a major concern in states like Punjab and Haryana, where excessive use of chemical fertilizers has led to groundwater contamination. Organic produce is also believed to have higher nutritional value, though research in this area is ongoing.", "normalised": "One significant advantage of organic farming is its reduced environmental footprint.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges, however, remain. Organic farming often requires more labor input compared to conventional farming. Yields may initially be lower during the transition period as the soil recovers its natural fertility. The cost of organic inputs, such as bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides, can sometimes be higher. Marketing organic produce can also be a challenge, although the demand is increasing, especially in urban areas. Farmers need access to efficient marketing channels and fair prices to make organic farming economically viable.", "normalised": "Challenges, however, remain.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of organic farming are undeniable. It is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to agriculture that can improve soil health, protect biodiversity, and provide consumers with healthier food options. With continued research, government support, and farmer education, organic farming can play a significant role in ensuring food security and environmental sustainability in India. A farmer from Maharashtra reported increased earthworm activity in his 500 sq ft plot after just one year of organic practices. Dr. Singh, an expert from IARI, estimates that organic yields can stabilize within 3-5 years with proper soil management. The initial investment can range from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 per acre, depending on the region and crops.", "normalised": "Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of organic farming are undeniable.
