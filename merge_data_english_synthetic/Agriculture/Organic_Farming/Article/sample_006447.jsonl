{"unnormalised": "Hey Kisan bhaiyon and beheno! Tired of hearing about pesticides and chemicals ruining our soil? Well, there’s a simpler, healthier way – Organic Farming! It's basically agriculture the way our grandfathers used to do it, before all the fancy (and often harmful) stuff came along. Think of it as “ghar ka khana” for your plants!", "normalised": "Hey Kisan bhaiyon and beheno! Tired of hearing about pesticides and chemicals ruining our soil?

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the big deal? Organic farming focuses on using natural inputs like compost, manure (like gau mutra, because, well, cows!), and bio-pesticides instead of synthetic fertilizers and chemical sprays. Remember that huge pile of cow dung near Sharmaji’s farm in Rajasthan? That’s black gold for organic farmers! We're talking about feeding the soil, not just the plant, which creates a much stronger, healthier ecosystem.", "normalised": "So, what’s the big deal?

{"unnormalised": "One of the main benefits is that the produce is way healthier. Less chemical residue means better for us, better for the environment, and honestly, it tastes better too! My grandmother, Dadi, swears the organic tomatoes from her garden taste sweeter than anything you can buy in the market. Plus, it's great for the soil in the long run. Chemical fertilizers can eventually deplete the soil, making it barren and useless. Organic farming, on the other hand, improves soil fertility, water retention, and overall soil health. Think of it as a long-term investment.", "normalised": "One of the main benefits is that the produce is way healthier.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you’re thinking: “But isn't organic farming more expensive and lower yielding?” Well, initially, yes, yields might be a bit lower while the soil adjusts. However, in the long run, healthy soil leads to sustainable yields. Plus, organic produce often fetches a higher price in the market. You can even sell directly to consumers in your local mandi or set up a stall at a farmers market in Delhi. Dr. Singh, a professor at Punjab Agricultural University, has done extensive research showing the long-term economic benefits of organic farming.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you’re thinking: “But isn't organic farming more expensive and lower yielding?” Well, initially, yes, yields might be a bit lower while the soil adjusts.

{"unnormalised": "There are challenges, of course. Pest control can be tricky, and it requires more hands-on management. Think neem oil sprays and manually picking off pests. Plus, getting certified as \"organic\" can be a process involving paperwork and inspections, costing you Rs. 5000 - Rs. 10,000, depending on the certifying agency. Many farmers start small, converting a portion of their land to organic practices, say 1000 sq ft as an initial trial.", "normalised": "There are challenges, of course.

{"unnormalised": "The government is also pushing organic farming through schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), providing subsidies and support to farmers who want to make the switch. So, why not give it a try? Talk to your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra, learn about composting techniques, and start small. You might be surprised at how rewarding it is to grow your own healthy, delicious, and environmentally friendly food! Jai Kisan!", "normalised": "The government is also pushing organic farming through schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (P K V Y), providing subsidies and support to farmers who want to make the switch.
