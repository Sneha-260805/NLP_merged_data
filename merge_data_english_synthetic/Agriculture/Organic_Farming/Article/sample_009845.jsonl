Ramlal, a farmer who had spent over 40 years tilling the land, felt a familiar pang of despair. The chemical fertilizers, once touted as the magic bullet for increased yields, had left his soil depleted and barren. The cost of pesticides and fertilizers was also spiraling, eating into his meager profits. “Rs. 5000 for a bag of urea…it's simply unsustainable,” he’d lament to his wife, Sita.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on the parched earth of Kishanpur, a small village nestled in the heart of Rajasthan.
