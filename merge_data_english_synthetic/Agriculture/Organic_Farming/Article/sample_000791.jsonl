{"unnormalised": "Basically, organic farming is about ditching the chemicals – no synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers allowed! Instead, we're talking about using natural methods like composting, crop rotation (think switching between rice and lentils, like they do in Uttar Pradesh), and even introducing beneficial insects to control pests. Remember grandma's stories of using neem leaves to keep bugs away? That’s the kind of wisdom we're tapping into.", "normalised": "Basically, organic farming is about ditching the chemicals – no synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers allowed!

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Sounds good, but does it actually work?\" Well, yes! Sure, the initial yield might be slightly lower compared to chemical-intensive farming, but the long-term benefits are undeniable. The soil becomes richer and healthier, able to hold more water, which is crucial, especially with the unpredictable monsoon seasons we face. Plus, let's be honest, food grown organically tastes better! It’s like the difference between a ripe mango from your own tree versus one you bought from a supermarket – you can just *feel* the difference.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you are thinking: \"Sounds good, but does it actually work?\" Well, yes!

He uses vermicompost (earthworm compost, made in his backyard!), and swears by it. He's seen a significant improvement in his soil health and, surprisingly, his income. He now sells his produce at a premium in the local farmers' market.", "normalised": "Lots of Indian farmers are embracing this shift.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Patel, a renowned agricultural scientist, often says, “Organic farming isn’t just a technique, it’s a philosophy.” He's advocating for more research and investment in this area. The initial investment may be around Rs. 50000, but the long-term gains are immense. It’s about giving back to the land and ensuring a healthier future for generations to come. And that, my friends, is something worth investing in.
