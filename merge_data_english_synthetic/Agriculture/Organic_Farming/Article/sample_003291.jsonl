{"unnormalised": "Organic farming, an agricultural system that relies on ecological processes, biodiversity, and cycles adapted to local conditions, is gaining significant traction in India as a viable alternative to conventional, chemical-intensive agriculture. It prioritizes environmental sustainability, soil health, and the production of safe, nutritious food.", "normalised": "Organic farming, an agricultural system that relies on ecological processes, biodiversity, and cycles adapted to local conditions, is gaining significant traction in India as a viable alternative to conventional, chemical intensive agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Unlike conventional farming, organic practices eschew synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, organic farmers in states like Maharashtra and Kerala employ a range of techniques, including crop rotation, composting, green manures, and biological pest control to enhance soil fertility and manage pests and diseases. For instance, Shri. Ramesh Kumar, a farmer from Andhra Pradesh, utilizes neem-based pesticides derived from the neem tree, a common sight across the Indian landscape, to protect his crops.", "normalised": "Unlike conventional farming, organic practices eschew synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms (G M Os).

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental conservation. Studies conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have shown that organically managed soils have higher levels of organic matter, improved water retention capacity, and enhanced microbial activity. This leads to increased soil fertility and resilience, making crops less susceptible to drought and other environmental stresses. Furthermore, organic produce is often perceived as healthier and tastier, fetching premium prices in the market. Consumers in cities like Delhi and Mumbai are increasingly willing to pay more for certified organic vegetables and fruits.", "normalised": "The benefits of organic farming extend beyond environmental conservation.

{"unnormalised": "However, the transition to organic farming is not without its challenges. Farmers often face lower yields during the initial years of conversion as the soil ecosystem readjusts to organic practices. Access to organic inputs, such as bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides, can also be limited and expensive, especially in remote rural areas. Certification processes, crucial for verifying the organic status of produce and accessing premium markets, can be cumbersome and costly for smallholder farmers.", "normalised": "However, the transition to organic farming is not without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Several initiatives are underway to promote organic farming in India. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), a centrally sponsored scheme, provides financial assistance to farmers for adopting organic practices and forming farmer producer organizations (FPOs). The National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) sets standards for organic production, certification, and accreditation. Institutions like the National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF) conduct research and provide training on organic farming techniques. Dr. Sharma from NCOF emphasizes the importance of educating farmers about the principles of organic agriculture and providing them with the necessary support to succeed.", "normalised": "Several initiatives are underway to promote organic farming in India.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of organic farming principles can lead to improved rural livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and enhanced food security. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of organic farming for India's agricultural sector are undeniable. Many farmers are switching to integrated farming systems incorporating organic methods across their land holding of say, 10,000 sq ft. and growing diverse crops. The market size for organic produce is projected to reach Rs. 75,000 million by 2025. Further investment in research, infrastructure, and farmer support is crucial to unlock the full potential of organic agriculture in India and pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient food system.", "normalised": "The adoption of organic farming principles can lead to improved rural livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and enhanced food security.
