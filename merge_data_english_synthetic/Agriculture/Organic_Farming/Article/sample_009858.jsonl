It was a far cry from the concrete jungle of Mumbai where her son, Rohan, worked a comfortable IT job. Kamala had always farmed, like her parents before her, but until a few years ago, she’d relied on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, readily available from the local cooperative society. Yields were good, but so was her debt. Every year, she'd have to borrow money to buy inputs, trapping her in a vicious cycle.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamala’s brow as she surveyed her two acre farm in Vidarbha, Maharashtra.

He even jokes about quitting his job and helping her expand the farm, perhaps even exporting organic produce to the European market. He envisions adding a polyhouse on a 1000 sq ft area and focusing on high-value crops. Kamala just smiles, the wisdom of generations etched on her face. She knows that organic farming is more than just a method; it's a way of life, a return to the roots, and a testament to the enduring spirit of the Indian farmer. She hopes that more farmers across India, even those living hundreds of km away in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, will embrace this sustainable path.", "normalised": "Rohan, observing his mother's success from Mumbai, is also contemplating a change.
