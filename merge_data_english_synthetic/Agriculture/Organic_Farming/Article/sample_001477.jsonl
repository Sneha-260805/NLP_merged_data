The transition was anything but smooth. The first few harvests were meager. Pests, previously controlled by pesticides, seemed to multiply overnight. Her neighbors, like Sardar Gurpreet Singh, openly scoffed, predicting her failure.", "normalised": "Inspired by a workshop conducted by the Punjab Agricultural University (P A U), Ludhiana, and fueled by a growing awareness of the detrimental effects of chemical agriculture, Kamala decided to convert her two acre plot.

She introduced crop rotation, alternating between wheat, pulses, and vegetables, naturally controlling pests and improving soil fertility.
