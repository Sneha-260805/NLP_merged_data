{"unnormalised": "Namaste friends! Tired of hearing about chemicals and pesticides in your food? Well, that's where organic farming steps in, like a friendly village elder reminding us of simpler times. Organic farming, in a nutshell, is all about growing crops and rearing animals the natural way, without relying on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Think of it as farming the way your Dadi used to do it!", "normalised": "Namaste friends! Tired of hearing about chemicals and pesticides in your food?

{"unnormalised": "In India, with our rich agricultural heritage, organic farming isn't some new-fangled trend; it's a return to our roots. Remember those stories of golden harvests from fields blessed by gomutra and nourished by compost? That's the spirit! Farmers like Mr. Sharma in Haryana are leading the charge, showing that you can indeed get bumper crops without dousing your fields in chemicals. He uses crop rotation, planting legumes to naturally fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing his reliance on expensive fertilizers.", "normalised": "In India, with our rich agricultural heritage, organic farming isn't some new-fangled trend; it's a return to our roots.

Think about those juicy mangoes from Konkan, grown organically – pure bliss! Secondly, organic farming is kinder to the environment. It promotes biodiversity, protects our precious water resources, and reduces soil erosion. Studies by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) show a significant improvement in soil health in organically farmed fields.", "normalised": "The benefits are pretty clear.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s be real, organic farming isn't a cakewalk. Yields can sometimes be lower in the initial years, and it requires more labor and knowledge. Weed control can be a challenge, requiring innovative solutions like companion planting (think tulsi next to your tomatoes!). The certification process can also be a bit of a hassle. You need to get your farm inspected and certified by organizations like APEDA to officially label your produce as organic. This involves costs, often in the range of Rs. 5000-Rs. 10,000 depending on the size of the farm.", "normalised": "Now, let's be real, organic farming isn't a cakewalk.
