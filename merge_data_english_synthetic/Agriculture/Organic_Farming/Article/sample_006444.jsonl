{"unnormalised": "Hey Kisan friends! Ever felt like the vegetables from the market just don't taste like they used to? Well, maybe it's time we looked back at how our grandfathers, like Dada Ji, used to farm – organically! Organic farming, simply put, is agriculture that shuns synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). It's all about working *with* nature, not against it.", "normalised": "Hey Kisan friends! Ever felt like the vegetables from the market just don't taste like they used to?

{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: instead of spraying your crops with chemicals, you're encouraging beneficial insects like ladybugs to control pests. Instead of drenching the soil with chemical fertilizers that can harm the earthworms (essential for healthy soil!), you're using organic compost, like the good old cow dung manure our villages have always relied on. Remember the 'Gobardhan Yojana'? That's the spirit!", "normalised": "Think of it this way: instead of spraying your crops with chemicals, you're encouraging beneficial insects like ladybugs to control pests.

This helps to prevent soil depletion and pest build-up. He tells us stories of farmers in Rajasthan who have successfully converted barren lands into thriving organic farms by implementing these simple techniques.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (I A R I), Pusa, Delhi, always emphasizes the importance of crop rotation in organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are HUGE. Organic produce is generally considered healthier, as it's free from harmful chemicals. It also tastes better! Plus, organic farming is much better for the environment. It protects our soil, water, and biodiversity. The soil in organic farms is richer in nutrients and holds more water, making it more resilient to droughts.", "normalised": "The benefits are HUGE.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming takes time and effort. You might see lower yields initially, and managing pests organically requires more knowledge and patience. But in the long run, it's a more sustainable and profitable option. Farmers in Maharashtra, for example, are fetching premium prices for their organic mangoes, sometimes Rs. 200 per kg more than conventionally grown ones!", "normalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming takes time and effort.

{"unnormalised": "The government too, is promoting organic farming through various schemes like the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY). They provide subsidies and training to farmers who want to adopt organic practices. My own little kitchen garden, just about 200 sq ft, uses entirely organic methods. I grow tomatoes, chillies, and even some spinach! The taste is just… amazing!", "normalised": "The government too, is promoting organic farming through various schemes like the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (P K V Y).
