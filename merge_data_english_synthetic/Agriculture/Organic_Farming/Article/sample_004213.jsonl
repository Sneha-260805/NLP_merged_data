{"unnormalised": "Hey folks! Ever wondered about the food we eat and how it gets to our plate? Well, let's talk about organic farming – a method that's gaining serious traction in India, and for good reason! Basically, organic farming is all about growing food the natural way, ditching those harsh chemical fertilizers and pesticides your grandfather probably warned you about. Think sustainable agriculture, but with a desi twist.", "normalised": "Hey folks! Ever wondered about the food we eat and how it gets to our plate?

{"unnormalised": "Instead of relying on synthetic stuff, organic farmers use things like cow dung manure (go-bar gas, anyone?), compost, and crop rotation to keep the soil healthy and fertile. This not only benefits the environment but also produces food that’s arguably healthier for us. Think of it like this: instead of bombarding the field with chemicals to kill pests, they introduce natural predators like ladybugs. Remember those from childhood? Now they're pest control!", "normalised": "Instead of relying on synthetic stuff, organic farmers use things like cow dung manure (go-bar gas, anyone?), compost, and crop rotation to keep the soil healthy and fertile.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it’s not always a walk in the park. The initial investment in organic farming can be higher, especially when it comes to getting certified by organizations like the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP). Plus, yields might be lower in the beginning compared to conventional farming. This means a higher price tag for organic produce at your local Sabzi Mandi. Rs. 100 for a kg of organic tomatoes? Ouch!", "normalised": "Of course, it’s not always a walk in the park.

{"unnormalised": "But think about the long-term benefits. Healthy soil, clean water, and food that’s free from harmful chemicals. Plus, organic farms are often more biodiverse, creating habitats for beneficial insects and animals. Many farmers are also adopting techniques like vermicomposting, using earthworms to break down organic waste into valuable fertilizer.", "normalised": "But think about the long-term benefits.

Even a small patch of 100 sq ft in your backyard can be converted into an organic garden. Imagine fresh, organic spinach straight from your own little farm! Isn’t it time we went back to our roots and embraced the wisdom of organic farming? Think about it! Maybe you can even convince your Nana-Nani to give it a try on their ancestral land near Patna!", "normalised": "So, the next time you're at the grocery store, keep an eye out for that \"Jaivik Bharat\" logo.
