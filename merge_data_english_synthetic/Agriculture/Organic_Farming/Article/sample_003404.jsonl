Instead of relying on chemical inputs, organic farmers in places like Maharashtra and Punjab utilize practices like crop rotation, composting, and the application of bio-pesticides derived from natural sources like neem (Azadirachta indica).", "normalised": "The core principles of organic farming revolve around building soil health, promoting biodiversity, and minimizing environmental impact.

Dr. Sharma, a researcher at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi, emphasizes the importance of indigenous knowledge in organic farming. \"Traditional farming practices, passed down through generations, often hold the key to sustainable and resilient agricultural systems,\" he notes.", "normalised": "For example, a farmer in Rajasthan might use a system of intercropping pulses with millet to fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Organic farming often requires more labor than conventional farming, and yields can sometimes be lower, at least in the initial years of transition. The certification process for organic produce can also be cumbersome and costly, particularly for smallholder farmers. Furthermore, marketing organic produce and ensuring fair prices for farmers is crucial. Organic products command a premium in urban markets like Mumbai and Bangalore, but access to these markets can be a hurdle for many rural producers.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of organic farming are substantial. Organic agriculture reduces pollution, conserves water, and enhances soil fertility. It also promotes biodiversity and provides habitats for beneficial insects and pollinators. From a consumer perspective, organic food is often perceived as being healthier and safer, free from pesticide residues and genetically modified ingredients.", "normalised": "Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of organic farming are substantial.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the adoption of organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation. Organic farming practices sequester more carbon in the soil than conventional agriculture, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study conducted by the National Centre for Organic Farming (NCOF) showed that organic farms in Uttar Pradesh stored an average of 2 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.", "normalised": "Moreover, the adoption of organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation.

{"unnormalised": "The future of Indian agriculture lies in embracing sustainable practices. While a complete transition to organic farming may not be feasible or desirable in the short term, a gradual shift towards more ecologically sound agricultural systems is essential. Initiatives that support organic farmers, promote consumer awareness, and foster research and development in organic farming techniques will be critical for achieving a truly sustainable and resilient agricultural sector. The cost of organic certification can range from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000 depending on the size of the farm. This coupled with the need for robust supply chains within a 100 km radius are challenges which need to be addressed to promote organic farming.", "normalised": "The future of Indian agriculture lies in embracing sustainable practices.
