For years, they'd followed the advice of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, relying on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to maximize yield. The results were impressive, initially. But something didn't feel right. The soil felt… lifeless. The vibrant ecosystem that her grandfather, Dada ji, had always talked about – the earthworms, the ladybugs, the fragrant tulsi plants – had dwindled.", "normalised": "The sun beat down on Kamala's face, a familiar warmth that spoke of generations spent tilling the soil of her family's farm in Rajasthan.

She understands that the journey is long and requires patience, but the reward – healthy soil, healthy food, and a healthy planet – is worth every bit of effort. Rs. 20,000 per acre is what she roughly earns, a small but growing margin which is only expected to increase. She envisions a future where all farms in Rajasthan, even those vast 100 km stretches, are teeming with life, nourished by the ancient wisdom of organic farming.", "normalised": "Kamala, now a champion of organic farming, regularly conducts workshops for other farmers in the region, sharing her knowledge and inspiring them to embrace sustainable practices.
