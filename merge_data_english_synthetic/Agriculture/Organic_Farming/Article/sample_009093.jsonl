It's basically farming the good ol' fashioned way – without all those nasty synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Think back to your Dadi's (grandmother's) garden in the village; that's probably closer to organic than what you find in most supermarkets.", "normalised": "Hey folks!

{"unnormalised": "In India, organic farming is seeing a real boom, especially in states like Sikkim, which is officially 100% organic! Farmers like Mr. Sharma from Haryana are switching over, realizing the long-term benefits for their land and their families’ health. It's not always easy, of course. The initial investment can be a bit higher – think about buying organic compost instead of cheap urea fertilizer. But the payoff in the long run is worth it, like getting that sweet, earthy taste from organically grown mangoes from Ratnagiri.", "normalised": "In India, organic farming is seeing a real boom, especially in states like Sikkim, which is officially one hundred percent organic!

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the big deal anyway? Well, organic farming focuses on building healthy soil. This means using things like cow dung (a staple in many Indian villages), compost, and green manure. These methods help the soil retain water better, which is crucial, especially during those unpredictable monsoon seasons. Plus, a healthy soil means healthier plants, which are naturally more resistant to pests and diseases.", "normalised": "So, what’s the big deal anyway?

{"unnormalised": "Now, switching over to organic isn't an overnight thing. It takes time for the land to detox from all the chemicals. There's even a certification process involved, which ensures that the produce is truly organic. Institutions like the National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF) are playing a big role in promoting organic practices and providing training to farmers.
