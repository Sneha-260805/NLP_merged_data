{"unnormalised": "Basically, organic farming is all about ditching the synthetic stuff. No chemical fertilizers, no artificial pesticides, nada! It's like farming the way our grandfathers did it, using natural resources and traditional wisdom. Think cow dung (gomutra is a bonus!), compost from kitchen scraps, and clever crop rotation strategies that Dr. Swaminathan himself would be proud of.", "normalised": "Basically, organic farming is all about ditching the synthetic stuff.

{"unnormalised": "Instead of spraying pesticides, organic farmers might use neem oil or introduce beneficial insects that prey on the pests. Weeds? Manual weeding (ouch!) or mulching with organic materials. Forget about those Rs. 5000/bag chemical fertilizers, it's all about nutrient-rich compost made right there on the farm. It's definitely more labour-intensive, but the long-term benefits for the soil and our health are massive.", "normalised": "Instead of spraying pesticides, organic farmers might use neem oil or introduce beneficial insects that prey on the pests.

{"unnormalised": "Why bother though? Well, for starters, the food is often considered tastier and definitely healthier. Studies show that organic produce can have higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. Plus, it's much better for the environment. Chemical fertilizers can pollute our rivers and groundwater, impacting entire ecosystems. Organic farming practices help keep our soil healthy, prevent erosion, and even sequester carbon, helping fight climate change. Win-win!", "normalised": "Why bother though?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn't a cakewalk. It can take a few years for the soil to recover from years of chemical use. Yields might be lower initially, and getting certified as \"organic\" by organizations like APEDA involves rigorous inspections and paperwork. But the demand for organic produce is steadily increasing, especially in urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai, fetching farmers premium prices.", "normalised": "Of course, transitioning to organic farming isn't a cakewalk.

{"unnormalised": "Many agricultural universities, like Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), are now offering courses and workshops on organic farming techniques. Government schemes also provide subsidies and support to farmers who want to make the switch. Even small kitchen gardens are experimenting.
