Think of it as farming the way your granddad used to, before all the fancy chemicals and whatnot. It’s basically about growing food naturally, keeping the soil healthy, and respecting Mother Earth.", "normalised": "Hey folks!

{"unnormalised": "Now, why bother with organic? Well, for starters, it's better for you! No nasty pesticides ending up on your plate. Think of those juicy organic mangoes from Ratnagiri – pure deliciousness without the worry. Secondly, it's kinder to the environment. Organic farming practices help build healthy soil, which soaks up carbon dioxide like a thirsty chapati soaks up dal. That's good news for climate change, right?", "normalised": "Now, why bother with organic? Well, for starters, it's better for you! No nasty pesticides ending up on your plate.

{"unnormalised": "Farmers like Mr. Patil in my village, Kolhapur, have been doing organic farming for years, and they swear by it. He uses traditional methods like crop rotation (switching crops to keep the soil fertile) and composting (turning kitchen scraps into nutrient-rich fertilizer). He even uses cow dung manure! It might sound gross, but trust me, it works wonders.", "normalised": "Farmers like Mister Patil in my village, Kolhapur, have been doing organic farming for years, and they swear by it.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't always a piece of cake, or should I say a piece of ladoo. It can be a bit more labor-intensive than conventional farming. Weeds need to be pulled by hand, pests need to be controlled using natural methods (like ladybugs eating aphids – a true Bollywood romance in the garden!), and yields might be slightly lower initially.", "normalised": "Of course, organic farming isn't always a piece of cake, or should I say a piece of ladoo.

Even if it costs a few Rs. more, you're investing in your health, the environment, and supporting farmers who are doing things the right way. You could even try growing your own organic veggies in your balcony garden – even a small patch of 100 sq ft can make a difference! Think of the fresh mint for your chai! It’s a win-win situation, really. Jai Kisan! And remember, eat local, eat organic!", "normalised": "So, the next time you're at the bazaar, consider buying organic.
