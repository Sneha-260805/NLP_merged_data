Practices like crop rotation, composting (using gobar, of course!), and bio-pesticides can enhance soil health in regions like Punjab and Tamil Nadu. While yields might initially be lower, the long-term benefits for the environment and consumer health are significant. Perhaps even influence Onam feasts with healthier options. Research at IARI, Pusa is crucial. Investing in training and farmer support, especially in Andhra Pradesh, will accelerate adoption.", "normalised": "Organic farming offers a sustainable path forward for Indian agriculture.
