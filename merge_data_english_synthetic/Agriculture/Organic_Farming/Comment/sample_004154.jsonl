While yields might initially be lower compared to conventional methods, the long-term benefits for biodiversity and reduced input costs (Rs. 5,000/acre est.) are significant. Perhaps a focus on traditional knowledge, like incorporating practices used during Onam festivities in preparing the land, can further boost organic adoption. This will help with a healthier biryani!", "normalised": "Organic farming holds immense promise for sustainable agriculture in India.
