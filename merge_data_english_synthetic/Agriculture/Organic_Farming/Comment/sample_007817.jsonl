Remember that workshop at IARI, Delhi in 2010? Mind-blowing! We need more farmers like Ramesh bhai from my village, growing organic mangoes. Makes a difference, right?

Must check price at Krishi Mandi at 10:00 hrs tomorrow.", "normalised": "Organic farming, eh? My naniji in Kerala always said it's the only way!
