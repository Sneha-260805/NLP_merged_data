{"unnormalised": "Just wanted to share my journey into the world of organic farming, inspired by my Thatha (grandfather) back in Kerala. He's been practicing traditional farming methods for over 60 years near Alappuzha, long before \"organic\" became a buzzword. I remember as a kid, helping him with the paddy fields, smelling the freshly turned soil, the air thick with the scent of jaggery and spices drying in the sun. It was a far cry from my software job in Bangalore!", "normalised": "Just wanted to share my journey into the world of organic farming, inspired by my Thatha (grandfather) back in Kerala.

But seeing the resilience of his farm, the quality of his produce (the best red rice you’ll ever taste!), and the flourishing ecosystem it supported, changed my perspective.

He uses cow dung manure, crop rotation techniques he learned from his father (circa 1930s, he says!), and natural pest control methods using neem oil and chili paste. On 26/01/1950, he remembers listening to the radio about the new Republic while planting rice. It felt like connecting with a different world. Now, I’m slowly starting my own small-scale organic farm on 5 acres of inherited land. It’s challenging, especially with the unpredictable monsoons hitting the region around 15/06, but incredibly rewarding. Any tips from fellow Indian organic farmers would be greatly appreciated! Planning on visiting the Kerala Agricultural University next week, probably around 10:00 hrs, to learn more about traditional seeds.
