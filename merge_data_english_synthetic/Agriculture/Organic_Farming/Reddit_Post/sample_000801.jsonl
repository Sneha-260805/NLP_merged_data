This is a significant hurdle for farmers in regions like Vidarbha, where livelihoods are already precarious. Access to reliable organic inputs like biofertilizers (for example, those developed by the I A R I, New Delhi) and biopesticides remains limited and sometimes expensive. Government subsidies and awareness programs, like those promoted by the A P E D A, are crucial but need more effective implementation at the grassroots level."}

Are there successful examples from your regions that we can learn from?
