He’d hear about the health impacts and the increasing cost of inputs from other farmers like Sharmaji. He started attending workshops conducted by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra near us.

{"unnormalised": "Remember the hailstorm of 20/03/2018? That was a massive setback. But we persevered. We adopted crop rotation, composting with cow dung (a staple in our culture!), and neem-based pest control. It took time, but we started seeing the results. The soil is healthier, the taste of our Bajra and pulses is undeniably better, and we're even attracting more local pollinators, like the vibrant Indian bees. Now, people travel from 50 km away to buy our organic produce at the local mandi on Saturdays! My daughter, Priya, helps me water the field at 06:00 hrs every morning. We celebrate Makar Sankranti (14/01) with a feast made from our organic harvest – it's the best feeling. This year, (2024), we hope to expand and introduce more farmers to these practices, inspired by Vandana Shiva’s work.", "normalised": "Remember the hailstorm of twentieth march two thousand and eighteen?
