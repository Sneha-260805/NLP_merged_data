{"unnormalised": "Wanted to share a story about my grandfather, Krishnaji Baba, and his mango orchard in Ratnagiri, Konkan. He started transitioning to completely organic farming back in '95, long before it was trendy. Initially, people laughed, called him \"pagal\" (crazy). Said you can’t grow Alphonso without chemicals, especially with the humidity and pests around here.", "normalised": "Wanted to share a story about my grandfather, Krishnaji Baba, and his mango orchard in Ratnagiri, Konkan.

Yields dropped, and neighboring farmers' fruit looked bigger and brighter.

He even got an award from the MPKV, Rahuri agricultural university! And all those \"pagal\" comments? They stopped a long time ago. 09:00 hrs tomorrow he will be giving a talk about his journey.
