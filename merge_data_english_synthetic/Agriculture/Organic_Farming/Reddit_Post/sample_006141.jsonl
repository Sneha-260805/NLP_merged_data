We grew rice, spices like cardamom and pepper, using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. But over time, the soil started degrading.

{"unnormalised": "Slowly, we expanded. Now, almost the entire farm is organic. The soil is healthy, buzzing with life. We even sell our produce at the local farmers market and online. It's hard work, I won’t lie. Profits took a dip initially, but the improved soil health and premium prices for organic produce eventually balanced things out. Appachan now proudly tells everyone how organic farming is \"the way our ancestors did it, before the chemicals came in.\" He even religiously tunes into the Krishi Darshan program at 19:00 hrs on DD Malayalam to learn more! It's a journey, not a destination, as they say in the Bhagavad Gita. Anyone else here practicing organic farming in India? I'd love to hear your experiences!", "normalised": "Slowly, we expanded.
