{"unnormalised": "I'm a farmer from a small village near Jaipur, Rajasthan. My family has been tilling this land for generations, mostly using traditional methods until the Green Revolution hit. We jumped on the chemical fertilizer bandwagon like everyone else, chasing higher yields. For a while, it worked. But the soil quality deteriorated, we needed more and more fertilizer each year, and the taste of our bajra just wasn't the same. Plus, the cost!", "normalised": "I'm a farmer from a small village near Jaipur, Rajasthan.

This year, 2024, our wheat crop is thriving - no chemical fertilizers, just good old-fashioned hard work and patience. It's not perfect, pest control is still a challenge. But seeing the earthworms back in the soil, and tasting the naturally sweet wheat... that makes it all worthwhile. We even harvested on 15/10/2024. Anyone else made the switch to organic?
