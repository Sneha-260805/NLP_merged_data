My Dada (grandfather), Ramrao Patil, used to be a big believer in chemical fertilizers back in the eighties and nineties. He saw the quick yields and thought it was the only way to survive in competitive markets near Pune. We’d spray, spray, spray – D A P, Urea, you name it. Our farm was a textbook example of modern agriculture, as taught at the agricultural college in Rahuri."}
