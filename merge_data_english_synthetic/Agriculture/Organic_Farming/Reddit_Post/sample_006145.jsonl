{"unnormalised": "r/Agriculture", "normalised": "Hey everyone! Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I wanted to share a story about my family's shift back to organic farming in our ancestral land near Alleppey, Kerala. My grandfather, Krishnan Nair, used to farm rice organically before the Green Revolution swept through in the sixties. We switched to high-yield varieties and chemical fertilizers, chasing bigger profits."}

My father, Ravi, noticed the decline. He started researching alternative methods around two thousand and ten and stumbled upon the concept of 'zero-budget natural farming', popularized by Subhash Palekar. It resonated deeply with him."}

The soil has come alive, teeming with earthworms. We grow rice, vegetables, and even some spices like cardamom. The taste? Unbeatable! Even my skeptical grandmother, Ammachi, admits the rice tastes like it did in her childhood. We even sell our produce at the local panchayat market on Thursdays at nine thirty hours. It’s hard work, but seeing the land thrive and knowing we’re contributing to a healthier ecosystem makes it all worthwhile. Anyone else trying organic farming in India? Would love to hear your experiences!"}
