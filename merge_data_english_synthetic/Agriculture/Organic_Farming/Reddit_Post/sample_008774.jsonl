{"unnormalised": "Hey r/Agriculture, I wanted to share my experiences transitioning my family's land in Rajasthan back to organic farming. My grandfather, Kishan Lal ji, always practiced traditional methods, but after he passed in 2005, my father, swayed by promises of quick yields, adopted chemical fertilizers and pesticides. We saw an initial increase in production of bajra and moong, but the soil quality deteriorated rapidly. We started noticing lower crop yields, needing more and more inputs.", "normalised": "Hey R slash Agriculture, I wanted to share my experiences transitioning my family's land in Rajasthan back to organic farming.

{"unnormalised": "Last year, on 26/01/2023, I returned home after finishing my agriculture degree from Punjab Agricultural University. I was shocked to see the state of our fields. I convinced my father to let me experiment with organic methods on a small 2-acre plot. We started with composting using cow dung from our Gaushala and neem oil for pest control. It was challenging, especially during the initial months. The yield was lower in the first cycle than what we'd gotten using chemicals.", "normalised": "Last year, on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty three, I returned home after finishing my agriculture degree from Punjab Agricultural University.

We harvested the second crop on 14/04/2024 at around 16:00 hrs. The local market in Jaipur, the Sabzi Mandi, even paid us a premium for organically grown produce!", "normalised": "But, gradually, things started changing.

{"unnormalised": "Now, we are slowly converting the entire farm. It's a long process, and I am still learning every day. My grandfather’s wisdom about \"dharti maa\" (Mother Earth) being a living organism is proving to be absolutely correct. Hoping to share more updates on this journey. Anyone else here from India doing organic farming? Let's connect! I'm especially interested in hearing about experiences with Jivamrita.", "normalised": "Now, we are slowly converting the entire farm. It's a long process, and I am still learning every day.
