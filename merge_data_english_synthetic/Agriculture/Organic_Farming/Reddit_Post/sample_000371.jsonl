{"unnormalised": "Hey r/Agriculture,", "normalised": "I wanted to share a story about my grandfather, Dada Patil, and his journey into organic farming in a small village near Pune, Maharashtra. Dada Patil always believed in \"mitti ka ashirwad\" (the soil's blessing). He used to follow conventional methods for sugarcane farming, like everyone else in the village. But around two thousand five, things started to change. The soil was getting depleted, and the yields were declining despite using increasing amounts of chemical fertilizers."}

He started small, dedicating two acres to organic practices. It was tough at first, with lower yields for the first year. But he kept at it, applying jeevamrut and other organic concoctions he learned to make. Slowly, the soil came back to life. Earthworms reappeared, and the sugarcane started to thrive. Now, in two thousand and twenty four, his entire ten acre farm is fully organic, and he earns a premium at the local market. He even holds workshops for other farmers on twenty sixth january every year at ten zero zero hours."}
