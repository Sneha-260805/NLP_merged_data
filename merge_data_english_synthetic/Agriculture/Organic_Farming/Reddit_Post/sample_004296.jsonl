{"unnormalised": "We've seen a growing interest in organic produce, driven by health concerns and environmental consciousness. However, transitioning from conventional farming to organic isn't always straightforward, especially for smallholder farmers like those in Vidarbha or Bihar. The initial dip in yield during the transition period (typically 2-3 years) can be a significant deterrent.", "normalised": "We've seen a growing interest in organic produce, driven by health concerns and environmental consciousness.

Furthermore, market linkages for organic produce need strengthening.

{"unnormalised": "Thinking about the future, how can we ensure organic farming becomes more accessible and economically viable for Indian farmers? Are there successful examples of farmer collectives or cooperatives that have effectively adopted organic practices? I believe focusing on traditional knowledge coupled with modern scientific inputs could be the key. Maybe celebrating the harvest festival of Onam with organically grown rice could be a great start! Let’s discuss this over a plate of Hyderabadi biryani and share our experiences.", "normalised": "Thinking about the future, how can we ensure organic farming becomes more accessible and economically viable for Indian farmers?
