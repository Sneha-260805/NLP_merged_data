He’s been farming the same five acres organically since before I was even born – way before it was trendy, or subsidized by the government. He says he remembers getting advice from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University back in the seventies about soil health."}
{"unnormalised": "Hey r/Agriculture,", "normalised": "There are no fancy certifications or marketing gimmicks here. Just generations of knowledge passed down. He uses Jeevamrutham (a fermented microbial culture), made from cow dung and jaggery, a recipe he learned from a wandering sadhu near the village. He also plants marigolds and basil throughout the orchard to naturally repel pests – a trick he picked up around nineteen eighty five, I think."}

I remember one particularly dry summer in two thousand and ten when yields were down. We harvested at around five zero zero P M on twenty fourth May two thousand and ten and they were half of what they should have been. Still, he refused to use chemical fertilizers, believing it would ruin the long-term health of the soil."}

The yields aren't always huge, and the work is intense. But the taste of that amla, and knowing it comes from land nourished with love and respect, is worth it. It reminds me that sometimes the oldest ways are the best ways. He plans to keep going till at least he hits ninety years old, around first January two thousand and thirty."}
