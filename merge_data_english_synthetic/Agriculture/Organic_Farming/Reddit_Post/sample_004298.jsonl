Yields often decrease initially, and farmers require rigorous training in composting techniques, pest management using biopesticides (like neem oil), and weed control. Government schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (P K V Y) offer some support, but access can be challenging, involving cumbersome paperwork and delays in disbursal of funds."}

Inspections are regular, and record-keeping is crucial. This can be particularly difficult for small landholders who may lack formal education. There's also the issue of cross-contamination from neighboring conventional farms, especially where pesticide drift is common. Imagine the impact on a meticulously cultivated organic paddy field during harvest season!"}
