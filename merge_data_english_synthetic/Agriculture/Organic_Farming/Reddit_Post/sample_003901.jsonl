{"unnormalised": "My family has been farming in Rajasthan for generations. Like many, we shifted to conventional methods back in the 80s, chasing higher yields with fertilizers and pesticides. My grandfather, Dada Ji, wasn’t thrilled, always saying \"This isn’t how we did things! Remember the taste of that bajra, the sweetness of the jaggery?\" He passed away in 2010, but his words stayed with me.", "normalised": "My family has been farming in Rajasthan for generations.

{"unnormalised": "A few years ago, inspired by stories from folks at the Navdanya movement (Shoutout to Vandana Shiva!), I started experimenting with organic practices on a small plot. Think composting with desi cow dung, using neem oil as a pesticide, and crop rotation based on ancient knowledge. It was tough, yields dropped initially, and neighbors raised eyebrows. Remember when I accidentally let the goats loose in the tomato patch at 14:00 hrs? Yeah, not fun.", "normalised": "A few years ago, inspired by stories from folks at the Navdanya movement (Shoutout to Vandana Shiva!), I started experimenting with organic practices on a small plot.

{"unnormalised": "But slowly, things changed. The soil came alive again. The produce tasted better, just like Dada Ji described. We got certified organic on 01/01/2023. Now, we sell our produce at the local mandi and even supply a few restaurants in Jaipur. It’s not easy, the workload is intense, and the profit margins are tighter. But the satisfaction of nurturing the land, of honoring our traditions, and of producing healthy food for our community is immense. This 20 km stretch from our village is now completely organic. We even give workshops! Our next one is on 12/12/2024.
