Now, almost 12 years later (it's 25/12/2023 today), his farm is thriving! The soil is healthier, the produce tastes amazing, and he’s selling at a premium in the local market (around 50 Rs. more per kg!). It wasn't easy, and there were many setbacks. But Babaji’s commitment to 'prakritik kheti' (natural farming) has shown us all that a more sustainable way is possible.
