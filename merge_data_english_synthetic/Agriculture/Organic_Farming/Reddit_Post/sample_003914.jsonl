{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share a bit about my grandpa, Dada Patil, and his journey with organic farming in our village near Pune, Maharashtra. Dada, a true son of the soil, always believed in respecting the land. Back in '90s, when chemical fertilizers were becoming all the rage, he stubbornly stuck to traditional methods. People laughed, calling him old-fashioned.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share a bit about my grandpa, Dada Patil, and his journey with organic farming in our village near Pune, Maharashtra.

He planted Marigold flowers around his farm to deter pests, something he learnt from his father. Dada swore by it, claiming \"these *gendas* are better than any chemical *dawai*\". Remember visiting him during Diwali celebrations, and instead of firecrackers, we'd be helping him spread ash from the *havan kund* around the fields – apparently, it's great for the soil!", "normalised": "He used cow dung manure, prepared Jeevamrut, a fermented microbial culture, religiously using desi cow dung and urine, besan and jaggery.

Even now, at 82 years old, he oversees the operations. He still wakes up at 05:30 hrs to check on his crops. My cousin, Rahul, recently graduated from the Agricultural College in Rahuri and is now helping Dada. They are planning to expand and get certified under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) scheme on 15/08/2024. Dada says, \"Organic farming isn't just a method, it's a way of life.\" Hope this inspires someone!
