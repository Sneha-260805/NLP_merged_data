He used to be a firm believer in the \"modern\" way, you know, the whole package deal of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that swept through India post-Green Revolution. I remember him buying tons of urea and D A P every season, especially during the paddy sowing time near Mandya. Around nineteen nineties he followed all those."}
