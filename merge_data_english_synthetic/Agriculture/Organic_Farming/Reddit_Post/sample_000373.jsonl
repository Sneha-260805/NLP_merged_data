{"unnormalised": "Hey r/Agriculture,", "normalised": "Growing up in a small village near Nashik, Maharashtra, I always saw my Grandpa, Bapu Kaka, practicing what we now call \"organic farming.\" Back then, it was just farming. He never used any chemical fertilizers or pesticides, relying instead on cow dung manure, crop rotation, and neem leaves as natural pest repellents. I remember helping him with the composting on fifteenth august two thousand and ten, and complaining about the smell! He’d just laugh and say, \"This is the smell of life, beta!
