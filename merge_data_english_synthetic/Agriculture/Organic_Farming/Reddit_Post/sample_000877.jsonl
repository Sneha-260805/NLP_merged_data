I wanted to initiate a discussion on the growing prevalence and potential of organic farming practices in India.", "normalised": "The benefits are undeniable – healthier soil, reduced water pollution, and ultimately, safer food for consumers. Techniques like vermicomposting using earthworms and the use of bio-pesticides derived from neem leaves are becoming increasingly common. Farmers are reporting yields that, while initially lower in some cases, eventually stabilize and even surpass conventional yields after a few years of soil regeneration."}
