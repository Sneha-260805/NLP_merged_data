He’s been doing it the traditional way for over 50 years near Kochi, and it's a whole different world compared to what I learned in agricultural science back at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, just wanted to share my experience dipping my toes into organic farming, inspired by my Thatha (grandfather) in Kerala.

{"unnormalised": "Remember that lecture about optimal NPK ratios and pesticide application rates? Well, Thatha just laughs. His farm runs on cow dung compost, neem oil, and a whole lot of intuition passed down through generations. He swears by his “Panchagavya” concoction, made according to ancient Ayurvedic principles. At first, I was skeptical, especially after seeing the yield numbers from commercially grown paddy.", "normalised": "Remember that lecture about optimal N P K ratios and pesticide application rates?

I'm learning about the subtle cues – the types of weeds that indicate soil deficiencies, the timing of the monsoon rains (usually around June 1st) and how they influence planting schedules. Still got a long way to go, but Thatha says \"Patience, beta. The land will teach you.\" Anyone else here embracing organic methods, especially in the Indian context? Would love to hear your stories and learn from your experiences!", "normalised": "I spent last summer, from zero six hundred hours till noon each day, helping him convert a small portion of my family's ancestral land (about two acres) near Wayanad to a similar organic system.
