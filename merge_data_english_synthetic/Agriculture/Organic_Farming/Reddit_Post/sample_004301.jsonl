{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the transition period from conventional to organic farming can significantly impact yields. Many farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana, accustomed to high-yielding varieties relying on chemical fertilizers, are hesitant to embrace practices like crop rotation and green manuring due to initial productivity losses. Research from institutions like the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) needs to focus on mitigating these transition risks.", "normalised": "Firstly, the transition period from conventional to organic farming can significantly impact yields.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, soil health is paramount. Traditional Indian farming systems, in many regions, have depleted the soil’s organic content. Implementing practices like vermicomposting and promoting the use of organic fertilizers like Jeevamrutham are vital. It will be essential to get this right especially as India approaches Onam and other harvest festivals where fresh ingredients are key for dishes like Payasam.", "normalised": "Finally, soil health is paramount.
