{"unnormalised": "Wanted to share my little farming experiment in my ancestral village, Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. After working in Bangalore for 10 yrs, I felt this pull to return and try my hand at organic farming. My grandfather, Dada ji, always talked about the 'good old days' before chemical fertilizers, when the soil was alive. He'd say, “Beta, the land has its own rhythm, you just need to listen.”", "normalised": "Wanted to share my little farming experiment in my ancestral village, Rampur, Uttar Pradesh.

{"unnormalised": "I started with a small plot of 2 acres. The first year was tough, I tell you! Yields were significantly lower compared to my neighbors using traditional methods. I faced a lot of skepticism from them, especially when I insisted on using cow dung compost from my own Gaushala and neem oil sprays instead of readily available pesticides. One farmer, Sharma ji, even joked that I was going back to the Stone Age!", "normalised": "I started with a small plot of two acres. The first year was tough, I tell you!

The land provides!” Even Sharma ji stopped by, 16:30 hrs, and grudgingly admitted that my mangoes were indeed superior! Aiming for a bigger harvest next year, starting preparation at 05:00 hrs, 25/12/2024. It’s a long journey, but rewarding. Any other Indian farmers on here with organic farming experiences?
