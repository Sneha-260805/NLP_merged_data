My grandfather, Dada Patil, a man of the soil through and through, always reminisced about the \"old ways\" before chemical fertilizers became the norm after the Green Revolution.

We also experimented with intercropping – growing vegetables between the rows of our main crop of jowar. By 10/10/2023, the soil felt different – richer, more alive. The earthworms were back in force.
