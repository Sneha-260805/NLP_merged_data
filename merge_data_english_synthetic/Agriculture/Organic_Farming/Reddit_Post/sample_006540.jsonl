While the demand for organic produce is steadily increasing, driven by health-conscious consumers and export opportunities (especially to the E U and the Middle East), there are significant hurdles that need to be addressed."}

The certification process, governed by agencies like A P E D A under the National Programme for Organic Production (N P O P), can be lengthy and expensive, deterring smaller farmers, especially in remote areas like the Himalayan foothills."}

Consumers in cities like Delhi and Mumbai are willing to pay a premium, but building trust and ensuring authenticity is key. Locally, in villages celebrating Onam, many prefer traditionally grown rice varieties despite the lower yield. Ensuring fair prices and accessible markets will encourage more farmers to embrace organic practices. We need robust supply chains that minimise post-harvest losses. Looking forward to your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Are there any successful models you have seen or been a part of?"}
