He felt it wasn't sustainable and saw the declining soil health first hand. We took the plunge in 2012, starting with a small patch of areca nut plantation. It was tough! The yield dipped drastically in the first couple of years. We experimented with Jeevamrutham and Panchagavya based on recipes from local farmers.

We lost a significant portion of our tomato crop in 2015 due to blight. But slowly, things started improving. The soil regained its fertility, and we began seeing earthworms again – a welcome sight! Now, in 2023, we are completely organic, selling our produce at the weekly market in Bangalore at a premium. It’s been a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey. Anyone else have similar experiences they’d like to share? Perhaps tips for dealing with late-season pests around 16:00 hrs, 12/11/2023? Any advice is welcome before the next harvest around 06:30 hrs, 15/04/2024. Let's learn from each other.", "normalised": "We faced several setbacks.
