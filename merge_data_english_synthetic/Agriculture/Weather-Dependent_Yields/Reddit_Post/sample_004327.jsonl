For example, excessive rainfall in the flowering stage can drastically reduce rice yields, sometimes by as much as thirty percent in certain districts. Similarly, prolonged dry spells during the crucial monsoon season severely impact ragi production."}

This data is from the I M D (India Meteorological Department) and field studies conducted by Krishi Vigyan Kendras. What's particularly alarming is the increased frequency of erratic weather events in recent years. We've seen flash floods damaging fields in Kodagu and prolonged droughts affecting farmers in the arid regions of northern Karnataka. This directly affects their livelihoods."}

What specific strategies have you found effective in mitigating weather-related risks? I'm particularly interested in hearing about traditional irrigation techniques or drought-resistant varieties being used in your regions. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. I am also interested in hearing about P M F B Y and whether the rupees have provided any stability. Let’s discuss."}
