{"unnormalised": "Preliminary data from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) suggests a strong positive correlation between adequate rainfall during the early stages of transplantation (July-August) and higher yields. Conversely, excessive rainfall leading to flooding, especially near coastal areas like Nagapattinam, can significantly depress yields. The 2018 floods, for example, caused substantial crop loss in several districts.", "normalised": "Preliminary data from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (T N A U) suggests a strong positive correlation between adequate rainfall during the early stages of transplantation (July-August) and higher yields.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone here worked on similar analyses, especially regarding climate change impacts on agricultural yields in India? I'm particularly interested in models that incorporate soil moisture data and evapotranspiration rates. Any insights, resources, or relevant publications would be greatly appreciated. We need better forecasting models to help farmers like Mr. Rajesh from Thanjavur optimize their practices and mitigate risks.", "normalised": "Has anyone here worked on similar analyses, especially regarding climate change impacts on agricultural yields in India?
