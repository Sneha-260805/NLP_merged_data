While the monsoon rains are vital for crops like rice and pulses, excessive or erratic rainfall can drastically impact yields. My own observations in Vidarbha this year showed how a delayed monsoon followed by intense downpours negatively affected soyabean production.", "normalised": "The Kharif season in India presents both opportunities and challenges.

Instead of solely relying on water-intensive rice, farmers could consider drought-resistant millets like Jowar or Bajra, especially in regions facing water scarcity.", "normalised": "We need robust strategies to mitigate weather-related risks.

Often, the assessment process is lengthy, and payouts are delayed, which adds to the financial burden. We should explore innovative insurance models, perhaps incorporating remote sensing and GIS technologies for quicker damage assessment.", "normalised": "Furthermore, crop insurance schemes need to be more accessible and farmer-friendly.
