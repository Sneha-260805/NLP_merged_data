{"unnormalised": "Namaste farmers and agricultural enthusiasts!", "normalised": "I am curious to hear your experiences and perspectives on weather-dependent crop yields, particularly in the context of Indian agriculture. We all know how crucial the monsoon is, but its variability can severely impact production. A delayed monsoon in Maharashtra can devastate onion and sugarcane crops, while excessive rainfall in Kerala can ruin paddy fields just before Onam."}

Are there traditional farming techniques, passed down through generations, that are still relevant and effective? For example, my grandfather always said a particular type of cloud formation signified good rain for the next seven days."}
