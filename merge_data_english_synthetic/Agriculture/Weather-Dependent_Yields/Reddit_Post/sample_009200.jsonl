What strategies are you employing to mitigate these risks? We are considering implementing drought-resistant varieties and improved irrigation techniques, focusing on water conservation practices, perhaps involving drip irrigation over five kilometer. What innovative solutions are being explored to build climate resilience in agriculture? Share your insights, especially regarding regional challenges such as soil salinity in coastal Karnataka. Rupee fifty thousand worth of damaged crops can devastate a family. Let us discuss how to safeguard yields and farmer income in the face of increasing climate uncertainties.
