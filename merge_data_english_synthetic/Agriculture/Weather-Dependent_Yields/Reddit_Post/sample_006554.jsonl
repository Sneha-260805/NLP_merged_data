{"unnormalised": "Hello r/Agriculture,", "normalised": "As the Kharif season wraps up, I wanted to discuss the pervasive impact of weather patterns on crop yields, particularly relevant here in India. This year, we saw erratic monsoon behavior across the Gangetic plains, impacting rice and pulses substantially."}

Later, prolonged dry spells reduced yields significantly. Similar scenarios played out in West Bengal, affecting jute production."}

Her team estimates that a ten percent rainfall deficit can lead to a five to seven percent yield reduction in rain-fed areas."}

Imagine the frustration of a farmer preparing his fields for Onam, hoping for a bountiful harvest to celebrate, only to face crop failure due to unpredictable weather. This impacts livelihoods and food security."}
