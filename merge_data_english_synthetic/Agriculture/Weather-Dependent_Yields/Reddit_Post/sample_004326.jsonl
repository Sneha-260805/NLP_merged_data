{"unnormalised": "We've been looking at data spanning the last 10 years, specifically focusing on paddy rice and jowar. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between erratic monsoon seasons and significantly reduced yields. For instance, a deficit of 200 mm during the critical vegetative stage can lead to a 15-20% reduction in rice production. This directly impacts the livelihoods of farmers who depend on these crops for income and sustenance.", "normalised": "We've been looking at data spanning the last ten years, specifically focusing on paddy rice and jowar. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between erratic monsoon seasons and significantly reduced yields. For instance, a deficit of two hundred millimeter during the critical vegetative stage can lead to a fifteen to twenty percent reduction in rice production. This directly impacts the livelihoods of farmers who depend on these crops for income and sustenance."}

Initial data looks promising, showing some varieties are capable of maintaining yields even with limited water availability.", "normalised": "The study also explores the effectiveness of drought-resistant varieties developed by the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad.
