{"unnormalised": "Looking at the data across the Kaveri delta region, there's a clear correlation between rainfall deviation from the norm (past 5 years average) and yield per hectare. A 20% decrease in rainfall around the planting season (typically late June-early July) translated to roughly a 15% reduction in yield this season.", "normalised": "Looking at the data across the Kaveri delta region, there's a clear correlation between rainfall deviation from the norm (past five years average) and yield per hectare.
