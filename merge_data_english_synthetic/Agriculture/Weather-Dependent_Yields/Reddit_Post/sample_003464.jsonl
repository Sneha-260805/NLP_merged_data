{"unnormalised": "Namaste, fellow farmers and agriculture enthusiasts! I wanted to share a personal story illustrating just how brutal weather-dependent yields can be, especially here in Vidarbha, Maharashtra. My family has tilled the same 5 acres near Yavatmal for generations. My Dada ji (grandfather), used to tell stories of plentiful harvests, but those days feel like a distant dream.", "normalised": "Namaste, fellow farmers and agriculture enthusiasts!

The seedlings were stressed, leaves drooping in the relentless sun. We irrigatied as much as we could from the well, but it's a limited resource. Remember that hailstorm on 12/04/2023? That wiped out a good portion of the wheat crop that year.", "normalised": "This year's monsoon started late, around twenty fifth june two thousand and twenty four.

Fields were waterlogged, leading to root rot in the cotton.

{"unnormalised": "My cousin, who studied at the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, keeps talking about drought-resistant varieties and improved irrigation techniques. But these things need investment, and for small farmers like us, every Rupee counts. It's disheartening to see years of hard work washed away, quite literally. Any other farmers dealing with similar issues? Would love to hear your experiences and maybe share some knowledge. Ram Ram!", "normalised": "My cousin, who studied at the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, keeps talking about drought-resistant varieties and improved irrigation techniques.
