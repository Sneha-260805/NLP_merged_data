Initial data suggests a significant correlation between delayed monsoons and reduced output. We're seeing variability of up to 20% depending on the timing and intensity of rainfall.", "normalised": "I'm working on a small project examining the impact of erratic rainfall patterns on rice yields in the Kaveri delta region.
