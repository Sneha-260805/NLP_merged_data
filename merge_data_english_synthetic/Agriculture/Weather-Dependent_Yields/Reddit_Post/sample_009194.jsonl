We are observing yield reductions of up to fifteen percent in areas particularly vulnerable. Think about the implications for Onam feasts in Kerala, where rice is the undisputed star!"}

I am particularly interested in hearing about regional differences and successful mitigation strategies. Any insights, published research or practical tips (e.g., specific crop varieties that are showing resilience, innovative water management approaches) would be greatly appreciated. What about the use of G I S in crop monitoring? Let us discuss!"}
