Erratic rainfall, prolonged dry spells, and unexpected hailstorms have demonstrably affected rice, pulses (tur dal, moong), and cotton production."}
{"unnormalised": "Hello fellow agronomists,", "normalised": "We've observed yield reductions ranging from fifteen to thirty percent in affected areas compared to previous years, impacting farmers' livelihoods significantly. The I M D data corroborates these observations, showing deviations from the long-term average rainfall."}
