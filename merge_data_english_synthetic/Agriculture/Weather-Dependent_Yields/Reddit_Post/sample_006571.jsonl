{"unnormalised": "We’re using historical data from the past 30 years (1993-2023) – rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, and solar radiation – collected from various Krishi Vigyan Kendras across the delta. Preliminary results show a strong correlation between timely monsoon arrival and higher yields. Delays of even 2 weeks can significantly reduce production.", "normalised": "We’re using historical data from the past thirty years (nineteen ninety three to two thousand and twenty three) – rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, and solar radiation – collected from various Krishi Vigyan Kendras across the delta.

{"unnormalised": "For example, in years with excessive rainfall (above 1200 mm during the Kharif season), we observe increased fungal diseases, leading to yield losses of up to 15%. Conversely, years with deficient rainfall (below 800 mm) necessitate increased irrigation, impacting groundwater resources and potentially affecting future yields.", "normalised": "For example, in years with excessive rainfall (above one thousand two hundred millimeter during the Kharif season), we observe increased fungal diseases, leading to yield losses of up to fifteen percent. Conversely, years with deficient rainfall (below eight hundred millimeter) necessitate increased irrigation, impacting groundwater resources and potentially affecting future yields."}
{"unnormalised": "Interestingly, our models also suggest that specific temperature thresholds during the flowering stage (typically late September/early October, coinciding with the Onam festival season) are critical. Temperatures exceeding 35°C during this period are detrimental to grain filling.", "normalised": "Interestingly, our models also suggest that specific temperature thresholds during the flowering stage (typically late September slash early October, coinciding with the Onam festival season) are critical.

Furthermore, integrating traditional knowledge with modern forecasting techniques is essential. Any insights or experiences regarding weather-dependent yields, particularly in similar tropical regions, would be greatly appreciated. Specifically, does anyone have data on the impact of Cyclone-related floods on rice production in the Godavari Delta, Andhra Pradesh? I'm also interested in learning more about the economic implications of these fluctuations, like increased prices of staple foods like biryani.
