Then the monsoon was late, proper late. Finally started properly around 01/07/2023, but it's been erratic. Some days it's a deluge, like 200mm in a single day, flooding everything.

He's facing the same problem. We were discussing how the scientists at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) warned about these increasing weather fluctuations. We both remember Dr. Sharma's lecture back in 2015 about climate change and its potential impact. I'm starting to think about alternative crops. Maybe something drought-resistant next year. Harvest day is tentatively planned for 15/11/2023, but honestly, at this rate, I'm not expecting much. I'm dreading that 16:00 hrs visit to the mandi. Anyone else facing similar issues with their crops this season? Any advice from experienced farmers out there?", "normalised": "My grandfather always says, \"Farming is fate\", but even he's worried.
