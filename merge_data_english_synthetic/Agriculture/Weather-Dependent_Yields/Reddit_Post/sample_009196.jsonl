We've seen significant yield fluctuations directly linked to unpredictable rainfall patterns."}
{"unnormalised": "Hello r/Agriculture,", "normalised": "Preliminary data from the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth suggests that Bajra yields are down by approximately fifteen percent in certain regions of Vidarbha due to prolonged dry spells in July. Conversely, areas experiencing excessive rainfall in Marathwada, especially during flowering stages, have reported fungal diseases impacting soybean production, leading to an estimated twenty percent loss."}
