As many of us know, Indian agriculture is heavily monsoon-dependent. Irregular monsoons, coupled with rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events (like cyclones and floods), are causing significant yield fluctuations across the country."}

What strategies are you using to mitigate these risks? For example, are subsidized irrigation schemes being effective in your districts, or are farmers facing challenges in accessing them? Are there any successful examples of community-led initiatives focused on water conservation and drought preparedness you can share? Let's discuss!"}
