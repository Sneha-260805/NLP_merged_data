{"unnormalised": "Heard Rajasthan is even worse, with some farmers reporting near-total crop failure due to water scarcity. Makes you wonder if we need a 'Lagaan' sequel, but this time fighting climate change instead of the British Raj. Any tips on mitigating these weather risks? Maybe some smart irrigation techniques or crop insurance schemes you guys are using? Share your wisdom, please! My family's depending on this harvest! Any advice related to fertilizer application in unpredictable rain conditions will also be highly appreciated. Specifically for Rice and Sugarcane crops in the 25 degree latitudinal regions. Thanks in advance!", "normalised": "Heard Rajasthan is even worse, with some farmers reporting near-total crop failure due to water scarcity.
