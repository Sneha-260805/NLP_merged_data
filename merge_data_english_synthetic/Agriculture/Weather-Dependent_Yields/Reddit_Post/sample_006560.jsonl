As many of us know, unpredictable monsoon patterns, escalating temperatures, and localized droughts are significantly impacting agricultural productivity across the country, from the rice paddies of Kerala to the wheat fields of Punjab."}

We’ve seen rice yields drop by as much as fifteen percent in certain districts during years with erratic rainfall. This translates to significant economic losses for farmers like Raju from my village near Hyderabad, who relies heavily on his paddy crop."}
