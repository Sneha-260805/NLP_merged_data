Recent studies from I C A R (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) clearly demonstrate a strong correlation between monsoon patterns and the productivity of Kharif crops like rice and pulses across regions like the Indo-Gangetic Plain."}
{"unnormalised": "Namaste fellow agriculture enthusiasts!", "normalised": "Erratic rainfall, prolonged dry spells, or even unseasonal hailstorms can drastically reduce yields, leading to financial strain for farmers and affecting national food security. For instance, delayed monsoons in Maharashtra can severely impact soyabean and cotton production. The variability in rainfall is projected to increase due to climate change, posing a serious challenge."}
