The budget allocated for this phase was Rs. 50 lakhs. Furthermore, the introduction of solar-powered fencing along the forest periphery has proven effective in minimizing livestock depredation. The next phase aims to expand the program to other critical wildlife corridors, covering an additional 200 km. The state government is also considering implementing a comprehensive eco-tourism strategy to generate revenue for conservation efforts.", "normalised": "The project has also focused on mangrove restoration, planting over fifty thousand saplings across one hundred acres (approximately four million three hundred and fifty six thousand square feet) of degraded areas.
