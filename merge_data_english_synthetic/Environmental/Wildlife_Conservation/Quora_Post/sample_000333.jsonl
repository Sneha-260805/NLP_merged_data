{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation, in essence, is the practice of protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats. Why is it important? Well, biodiversity – the variety of life on Earth – is the foundation of healthy ecosystems. These ecosystems provide us with vital services like clean air, water, pollination (think mangoes from Ratnagiri!), and even disease regulation.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation, in essence, is the practice of protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats.

Expanding agriculture, infrastructure projects (like new highways cutting through forests), and illegal poaching all threaten our incredible natural heritage. Consider the Bengal tiger, our national animal; its population is slowly recovering thanks to Project Tiger, but it remains vulnerable. Similarly, the plight of the Indian rhino in Kaziranga National Park requires constant vigilance.", "normalised": "In India, the pressures on wildlife are immense.

Even small actions, like reducing your consumption, buying sustainably sourced products, and advocating for responsible development, can make a difference. Dr. Sharma, my professor, always emphasized that every sq ft of forest saved contributes to a healthier planet. Remember, conserving wildlife isn't just about saving animals; it's about safeguarding our own future. We need to value the intricate web of life, not just in monetary terms (Rs.), but for its intrinsic worth. And remember, individual actions can collectively create a massive impact.", "normalised": "What can you do? Support organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.
