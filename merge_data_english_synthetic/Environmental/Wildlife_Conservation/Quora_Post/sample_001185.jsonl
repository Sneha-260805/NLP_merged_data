We have seen encouraging growth in tiger populations thanks to Project Tiger, a landmark initiative started in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three. This has been especially evident in reserves like Bandipur National Park in Karnataka. The work of institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (W I I) in Dehradun is also vital for research and training."}
