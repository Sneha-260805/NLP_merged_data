Consider the respect for nature embedded in many Indian festivals, such as the reverence for elephants during some regional Onam celebrations. Strengthening this inherent connection to nature through education and awareness campaigns can foster a greater sense of responsibility towards wildlife conservation amongst the general public. Ultimately, protecting our wildlife requires a collective commitment to ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. Resources allocated need to be raised substantially, perhaps even by rupee five hundred crore in the next five years, with clear monitoring of how these funds are utilized across five thousand kilometer of protected areas."}
