Habitat loss due to deforestation and encroachment, poaching driven by the demand for animal parts in the black market (like tiger bones and rhino horns), and human-wildlife conflict, especially near reserve forests like Jim Corbett National Park, are significant challenges.", "normalised": "However, wildlife faces numerous threats.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? We can support organizations dedicated to wildlife conservation, practice responsible tourism that doesn't disturb animal habitats, advocate for stronger environmental policies, and educate ourselves and others about the importance of biodiversity. Remember the movie \"Roar: Tigers of the Sundarbans\"? It highlights the challenges faced by tigers and local communities. Even small actions, like reducing our carbon footprint and choosing sustainable products, contribute to a healthier planet for all living things, including our precious wildlife. Let's work together to ensure future generations can experience the wonder of India's natural heritage. The current allocation of Rs. 300 Cr in this year's budget will hopefully see positive results in the coming years with increased protected areas and animal populations.", "normalised": "What can we do?
