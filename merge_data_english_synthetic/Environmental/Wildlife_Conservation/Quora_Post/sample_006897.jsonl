Promote sustainable practices, reduce our carbon footprint, and educate others about the importance of protecting our incredible wildlife. Remember that powerful scene in the Bollywood film 'Haathi Mere Saathi' where Rajesh Khanna fights to protect elephants? It’s a reminder that each of us has a role to play. Even small actions, like choosing eco-friendly products, can make a difference. Let's ensure future generations can witness the beauty of India's diverse fauna. We need more dedicated people to work in this field, even at starting salaries that can be around Rs. 30,000 per month.
