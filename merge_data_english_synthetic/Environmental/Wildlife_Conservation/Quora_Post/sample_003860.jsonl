Tigers, like those in Ranthambore National Park, are apex predators that control herbivore populations, preventing overgrazing and maintaining the health of grasslands.

Initiatives like Project Tiger, launched on 01/04/1973, have had some success, but we need to do more.

Consider the impact on tourism, a significant revenue generator for many states like Rajasthan, if iconic species like the Bengal Tiger vanish. It's a shared responsibility. We must act now, before it's too late. The deadline for achieving many Sustainable Development Goals is approaching fast, namely 31/12/2030.
