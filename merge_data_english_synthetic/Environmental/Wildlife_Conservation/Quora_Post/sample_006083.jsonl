{"unnormalised": "India, rich in biodiversity, faces significant challenges. Habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion are major threats. Think about the shrinking forests of the Western Ghats, pushing species like the Nilgiri Tahr closer to extinction. Poaching, fueled by the demand for wildlife products, remains a persistent issue, despite stringent laws. The situation at Kaziranga National Park, for example, is constantly monitored, with anti-poaching patrols active 24/7.", "normalised": "India, rich in biodiversity, faces significant challenges.
