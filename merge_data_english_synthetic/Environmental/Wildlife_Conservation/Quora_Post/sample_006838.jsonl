For instance, declining vulture populations, once abundant across the subcontinent, led to a surge in feral dogs and associated health risks, costing the country significantly in public health resources. The use of diclofenac, a veterinary drug, was identified as the culprit.", "normalised": "Losing these species has cascading effects.
