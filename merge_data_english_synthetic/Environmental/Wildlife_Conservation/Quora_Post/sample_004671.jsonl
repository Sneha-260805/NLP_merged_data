{"unnormalised": "Why is it so important? Well, healthy ecosystems, teeming with diverse wildlife, provide essential services. Think about the pollinators that ensure our crops thrive, the forests that regulate rainfall (vital for agriculture), and the wetlands that act as natural flood defenses. Losing species disrupts these intricate balances, leading to potentially devastating consequences.", "normalised": "Why is it so important?

Supporting organizations working on the ground, promoting eco-tourism that benefits local communities, and making conscious consumer choices are all ways we can contribute.
