{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect is **community involvement.** Initiatives like Joint Forest Management (JFM) in states like Madhya Pradesh empower local communities to protect forests in exchange for certain rights, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. This reduces poaching and illegal logging.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect is **community involvement.** Initiatives like Joint Forest Management (J F M) in states like Madhya Pradesh empower local communities to protect forests in exchange for certain rights, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.

Project Tiger, launched in 1973, helped protect tiger reserves across the country, but expanding these protected areas and creating corridors connecting them is critical for genetic diversity and dispersal. We can learn a lot from how Kaziranga National Park, Assam, has managed its rhino population.", "normalised": "**Habitat preservation and restoration** are also paramount.
