Regularly surveying wildlife populations, studying their behavior, and understanding the impacts of climate change and human activities help inform conservation strategies. Institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) at Dehradun play a crucial role. Remember, even seemingly small actions, like reducing plastic usage, can indirectly contribute to wildlife conservation. We all have a role to play in protecting our natural heritage for future generations. We must act before its too late - maybe start by planting a tree on 05/06/2024 at 10:00 hrs. Remember, even a small donation of Rs. 100 can help organizations doing critical work. The last tiger census in 2022 showed a promising increase, let's continue this momentum!", "normalised": "Finally, research and monitoring are vital.
