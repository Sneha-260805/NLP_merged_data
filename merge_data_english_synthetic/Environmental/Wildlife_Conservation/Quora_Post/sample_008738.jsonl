{"unnormalised": "Firstly, habitat preservation is paramount. This includes protecting forests like the Sundarbans (critical for Bengal tigers), establishing more Community Reserves, and preventing encroachment for activities like mining. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, plays a crucial role here, empowering local communities like the tribals near Nagarhole National Park to sustainably manage resources.", "normalised": "Firstly, habitat preservation is paramount. This includes protecting forests like the Sundarbans (critical for Bengal tigers), establishing more Community Reserves, and preventing encroachment for activities like mining. The Forest Rights Act, two thousand six, plays a crucial role here, empowering local communities like the tribals near Nagarhole National Park to sustainably manage resources."}
{"unnormalised": "Secondly, combating poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Strict enforcement of laws, like the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is essential. Increased patrolling, use of technology like drones, and community involvement, as seen in the anti-poaching initiatives in Kaziranga National Park (home to the Indian rhinoceros), are vital. Remember the success in arresting Veerappan in 2004? Similar dedication is needed now.", "normalised": "Secondly, combating poaching and illegal wildlife trade.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, promoting human-wildlife coexistence. This involves implementing mitigation measures like building elephant-proof walls and trenches near agricultural areas. Compensation schemes for crop damage caused by animals, say Rs. 5000 for an elephant raid on a field, also need to be strengthened.", "normalised": "Thirdly, promoting human-wildlife coexistence.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, scientific monitoring and research is crucial. Regular surveys to assess animal populations, starting at 09:00 hrs on 26/01 every year (Republic Day), studying their behaviour, and understanding their habitat needs are necessary for informed conservation decisions. Captive breeding programs, like the one for the Great Indian Bustard, could also be explored. Let's aim for a greener future by 2047, the centenary of India's independence.", "normalised": "Finally, scientific monitoring and research is crucial.
