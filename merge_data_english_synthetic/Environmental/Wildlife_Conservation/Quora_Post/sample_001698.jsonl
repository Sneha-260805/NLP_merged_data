{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability, particularly relevant in a nation like India, rich in biodiversity. The preservation of our flora and fauna goes beyond mere aesthetics; it directly impacts ecological balance, human well-being, and economic prosperity. India faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation. Habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion, poaching driven by the demand for wildlife products, and human-wildlife conflict are some of the pressing issues. Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (W I I) in Dehradun play a crucial role in research, training, and conservation efforts. Government initiatives such as Project Tiger and Project Elephant have shown some success in protecting endangered species. However, continued monitoring, stricter enforcement of laws, and community involvement are essential. Local communities, particularly those residing in and around protected areas like the Sundarbans, are vital stakeholders in conservation efforts. Education and awareness programs must emphasize the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the importance of wildlife. Consider the majestic Bengal tiger, often associated with the power and beauty of the Indian wilderness. Its survival is intertwined with the health of our forests and the well-being of local communities. Even seemingly unrelated aspects like sustainable agriculture and reducing our carbon footprint contribute indirectly to creating a safer environment for wildlife. Let us all commit to supporting wildlife conservation. Whether it's contributing to organizations, advocating for responsible tourism, or simply appreciating the natural world around us, every action counts. Just as we celebrate Onam with a delicious Sadhya, we should celebrate and protect the diverse wildlife that enriches our nation. Ignoring this urgent need risks not only the loss of invaluable species but also jeopardizes the long-term health of our planet."}
