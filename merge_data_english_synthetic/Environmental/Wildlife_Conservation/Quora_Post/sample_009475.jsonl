Encroachment on forests for resources, often driven by economic pressures, pushes animals closer to human settlements, leading to conflict.

We need stricter enforcement of laws, increased funding for conservation programs, and a shift towards sustainable practices.

Think of the beauty of a peacock during a monsoon shower – a scene worth preserving for generations to come. Let's work together to ensure our grandchildren can experience it too."}
