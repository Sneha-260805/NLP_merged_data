India, with its rich biodiversity from the Himalayas to the Western Ghats, has a special responsibility in this arena. Think of the majestic Royal Bengal tiger of the Sundarbans, whose population, thanks to conservation efforts like Project Tiger (launched on 01/04/1973), is slowly recovering.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is more than just hugging trees; it's vital for a healthy planet and, surprisingly, crucial for our own well-being.

Forests regulate water flow preventing floods (remember the devastating floods in Kerala in August 2018?). Pollinators, like bees and butterflies, crucial for agriculture, are facing decline due to habitat loss. Consider the case of migratory birds visiting the Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan; their presence is an indicator of the overall health of the wetlands.", "normalised": "But why bother?
