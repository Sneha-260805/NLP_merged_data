{"unnormalised": "One effective strategy is habitat preservation. Declaring areas as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves – like the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand – provides safe havens for animals. However, mere declaration isn't enough; effective management, including anti-poaching measures and tackling human-wildlife conflict, is vital.", "normalised": "One effective strategy is habitat preservation.

We must strive to ensure that our magnificent species, like the Bengal tiger and the Indian elephant, thrive for generations to come, preserving India's rich biodiversity. Stronger interstate collaboration is also needed to manage wildlife corridors effectively.", "normalised": "Finally, strict enforcement of laws against poaching and illegal wildlife trade is paramount.
