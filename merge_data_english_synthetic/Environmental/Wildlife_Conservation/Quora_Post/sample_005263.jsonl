Support sustainable practices, reduce your consumption, and be a responsible tourist. Learn more about local conservation efforts and donate to organizations working on the ground. Even spreading awareness online, like right now at fourteen thirty hours, can make a difference. Educate yourself further; a good start is browsing the M O E F C C (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change) website.
