Habitat loss due to deforestation, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development, like the Delhi slash Mumbai Expressway impacting wildlife corridors, is a primary concern. Increasing human slash wildlife conflict, particularly with elephants raiding crops in states like Assam and tigers preying on livestock near reserves, further exacerbates the issue. Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade, often for traditional medicine or exotic pets, continues to decimate populations of species like the Bengal tiger and the Indian rhino."}
