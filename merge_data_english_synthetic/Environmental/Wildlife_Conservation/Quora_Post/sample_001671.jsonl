{"unnormalised": "We often hear about charismatic megafauna, but even the smallest insects play a vital role. Pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling all depend on a diverse range of species. When one species disappears, it can trigger a cascade of negative consequences, affecting everything from agriculture to water quality.", "normalised": "We often hear about charismatic megafauna, but even the smallest insects play a vital role.

It not only helped save the tiger population from extinction but also protected vast tracts of forest, benefiting countless other species. However, challenges remain. Human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss due to infrastructure development (like new roads near the Bandipur Tiger Reserve), and poaching at 04:30 hrs are ongoing threats.", "normalised": "Consider the impact of Project Tiger, launched on first April one thousand nine hundred and seventy three.
