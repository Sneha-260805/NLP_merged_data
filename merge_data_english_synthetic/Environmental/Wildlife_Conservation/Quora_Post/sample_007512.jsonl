Failing to protect our wildlife is failing to protect our heritage. We must strengthen enforcement against poaching, promote sustainable development practices, and raise awareness among local communities to safeguard our precious natural resources. Initiatives like Project Tiger and Project Elephant are commendable but need sustained funding and public support to truly succeed.
