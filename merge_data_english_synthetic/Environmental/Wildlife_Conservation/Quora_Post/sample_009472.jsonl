Simple actions, like reducing our plastic consumption and supporting eco-friendly products, can make a big difference. Educating ourselves and others about the importance of wildlife is the first step. Think globally, act locally. Every effort, no matter how small, counts in preserving India's and the world's rich biodiversity.
