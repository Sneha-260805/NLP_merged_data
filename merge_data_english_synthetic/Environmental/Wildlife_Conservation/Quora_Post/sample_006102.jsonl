It essentially involves protecting plant and animal species and their habitats from extinction and decline. Why is this so vital?", "normalised": "Firstly, biodiversity loss can disrupt ecosystems. Every species, from the majestic Bengal tiger of the Sundarbans to the humble earthworm in your backyard, plays a role. Removing one element can have cascading effects. Imagine the impact if the vulture population, which significantly declined in the early two thousands due to diclofenac poisoning, wasn't being actively conserved through programs like those run by the B N H S."}
