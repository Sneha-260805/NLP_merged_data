{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the long-term health of our planet. In India, a land rich in biodiversity, the challenges are particularly acute. Habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, urbanization, and infrastructure development (like the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor) poses a significant threat. Human-wildlife conflict, especially involving species like elephants in Assam and tigers in the Sundarbans, results in fatalities and economic losses for both humans and animals. Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade for products like ivory and rhino horn (believed to have medicinal properties), decimates vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "wildlife conservation is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the long term health of our planet in india a land rich in biodiversity the challenges are particularly acute habitat loss due to agricultural expansion urbanization and infrastructure development like the delhi dash mumbai industrial corridor poses a significant threat human dash wildlife conflict especially involving species like elephants in assam and tigers in the sundarbans results in fatalities and economic losses for both humans and animals poaching driven by the illegal wildlife trade for products like ivory and rhino horn believed to have medicinal properties decimates vulnerable populations"}

{"unnormalised": "Mitigation strategies must include stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws, such as the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and increased investment in anti-poaching measures. Community-based conservation programs, empowering local communities like those near the Bandhavgarh National Park to participate in conservation efforts, are crucial. Restoring degraded habitats and creating wildlife corridors can facilitate movement and genetic exchange between isolated populations. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) plays a critical role in research and training, informing conservation policies. We need to remember narratives like the one from the film “Kaal” to highlight the dangers of neglecting these issues.", "normalised": "mitigation strategies must include stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws such as the wildlife protection act of one thousand nine hundred and seventy two and increased investment in anti dash poaching measures community dash based conservation programs empowering local communities like those near the bandhavgarh national park to participate in conservation efforts are crucial restoring degraded habitats and creating wildlife corridors can facilitate movement and genetic exchange between isolated populations the wildlife institute of india w i i plays a critical role in research and training informing conservation policies we need to remember narratives like the one from the film “kaal” to highlight the dangers of neglecting these issues"}
