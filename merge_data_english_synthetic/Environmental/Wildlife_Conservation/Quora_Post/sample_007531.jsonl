{"unnormalised": "India, a land of immense biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation. Habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development (roads, dams) is a primary threat. The conversion of forest lands for purposes like mining and unsustainable logging drastically reduces crucial wildlife corridors.", "normalised": "India, a land of immense biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation.

{"unnormalised": "Poaching, driven by international demand for products like ivory and rhino horn, continues to decimate vulnerable populations, particularly elephants and rhinos in regions like Kaziranga National Park. Human-wildlife conflict, exacerbated by shrinking habitats, leads to retaliatory killings of animals that prey on livestock or damage crops. Farmers near protected areas often face significant losses, escalating tensions.", "normalised": "Poaching, driven by international demand for products like ivory and rhino horn, continues to decimate vulnerable populations, particularly elephants and rhinos in regions like Kaziranga National Park.

{"unnormalised": "Several active solutions are being pursued. The Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 is a cornerstone of legal protection. Project Tiger and Project Elephant, initiated decades ago, continue to focus on the conservation of these iconic species. Community-based conservation initiatives, involving local communities in the management and protection of wildlife resources, are gaining momentum. These initiatives often link conservation with livelihood improvement, offering alternatives to activities that harm wildlife.", "normalised": "Several active solutions are being pursued.

{"unnormalised": "Eco-tourism, when responsibly managed, can also contribute to conservation by generating revenue and providing employment opportunities. Festivals like Onam, with their emphasis on nature and harmony, can be leveraged to promote conservation awareness. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) plays a crucial role in research and training. However, ensuring adequate funding and stricter enforcement of environmental laws remains critical.", "normalised": "Eco-tourism, when responsibly managed, can also contribute to conservation by generating revenue and providing employment opportunities.
