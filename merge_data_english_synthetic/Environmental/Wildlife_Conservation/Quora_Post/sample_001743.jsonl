{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is a critical environmental issue globally, and particularly so in India, a nation rich in biodiversity but facing immense pressures on its natural habitats. Several effective strategies can be implemented and strengthened to address this challenge.", "normalised": "Firstly, habitat preservation is paramount. This involves establishing and effectively managing protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Project Tiger, for example, has been instrumental in increasing tiger populations, but consistent funding and manpower are necessary to manage protected areas effectively. Reducing human-wildlife conflict is also crucial. Measures such as building solar fences and providing alternative livelihood options for communities living near forests can minimize negative interactions."}

This requires well-equipped and trained forest guards, intelligence gathering, and strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws. Collaboration with local communities can greatly enhance anti-poaching efforts; offering them incentives to report illegal activities can be remarkably effective."}
