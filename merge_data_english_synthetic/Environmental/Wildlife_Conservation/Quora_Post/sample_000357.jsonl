Lately, I have been thinking a lot about wildlife conservation, especially considering how quickly things are changing in India. We often hear about Project Tiger and saving our national animal, which is definitely crucial. But wildlife conservation is so much bigger than that. It is about preserving entire ecosystems, from the Western Ghats to the Sundarbans."}
