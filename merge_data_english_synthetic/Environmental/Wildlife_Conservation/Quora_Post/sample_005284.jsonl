Habitat fragmentation due to infrastructure projects, such as new highways and railway lines cutting through forests, isolates animal populations and reduces genetic diversity.

Educating local communities about the importance of wildlife and providing them with alternative livelihoods, like eco-tourism centered around national parks, can significantly reduce human-wildlife conflict. Just as we celebrate the harvest season with Onam and enjoy a plate of delicious biryani, we must also appreciate and protect the natural heritage that sustains us. Conservation is not just an environmental issue; it is a social, economic, and cultural imperative.
