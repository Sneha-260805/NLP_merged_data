{"unnormalised": "One effective strategy is habitat preservation. Protecting existing forests and grasslands, like the Western Ghats, is paramount. Reforestation efforts, such as those undertaken by organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), play a significant role. Reducing human-wildlife conflict is also vital. Building fences around villages and educating communities on co-existence, as is practiced near Jim Corbett National Park, can significantly reduce attacks.", "normalised": "One effective strategy is habitat preservation.

Support for organizations working on the ground, and educating the public, especially through campaigns like Project Tiger, are all steps in the right direction.
