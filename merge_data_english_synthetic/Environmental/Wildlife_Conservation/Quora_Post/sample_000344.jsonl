{"unnormalised": "The decline of tiger populations in the early 20th century, drastically reduced to a mere 1411 in 2006, served as a wake-up call. Initiatives like Project Tiger, launched in 1973, have shown demonstrable success, but constant vigilance is required. Similarly, the preservation of elephant corridors in states like Kerala and Karnataka is vital to mitigate human-wildlife conflict.", "normalised": "The decline of tiger populations in the early twentieth century, drastically reduced to a mere one thousand four hundred and eleven in two thousand and six, served as a wake-up call.

These practices showcase how cultural traditions can contribute to conservation. Even simple actions like reducing meat consumption (especially bushmeat) and supporting sustainable agriculture can make a difference.", "normalised": "Consider the sacred groves maintained across India for centuries, protecting biodiversity due to deeply held religious beliefs.

{"unnormalised": "Onam celebrations, although centered around unity and prosperity, often involve extensive use of natural resources. Finding eco-friendly alternatives for decorations and ensuring responsible waste disposal are examples of how we can integrate conservation into our festive traditions. Ultimately, a concerted effort from all stakeholders is necessary to ensure that India's rich wildlife heritage is preserved for future generations. Ignoring this responsibility carries consequences that extend far beyond ecological damage.", "normalised": "Onam celebrations, although centered around unity and prosperity, often involve extensive use of natural resources.
