{"unnormalised": "One important strategy is strengthening protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Think of Kaziranga National Park in Assam, famed for its rhinos. Regular patrolling by forest guards, like those employed by the Assam Forest Department, is essential to deter poachers. Effective monitoring, perhaps utilizing drone technology implemented after the 2015 rhino poaching crisis, can make a significant difference.", "normalised": "One important strategy is strengthening protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

{"unnormalised": "Community involvement is another key aspect. Encouraging local communities, like the Bishnoi community known for their conservation efforts, to participate in conservation initiatives can be very effective. Providing them with alternative livelihood options, reducing their dependence on forest resources, is also vital. Schemes like eco-tourism, where locals can earn Rs. 5000 per month guiding tourists, can incentivise conservation.", "normalised": "Community involvement is another key aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing human-wildlife conflict is paramount. Electric fences, translocation of problematic animals (though controversial), and creating awareness programs are helpful. Remember the incident near Jim Corbett National Park on 26/01/2023, where a tiger strayed into a village? Early warning systems and rapid response teams can help mitigate such situations.", "normalised": "Addressing human-wildlife conflict is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, enforcing wildlife protection laws stringently is non-negotiable. Prosecution of offenders, as per the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, should be swift and decisive. We also need more research institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to conduct in-depth studies and inform conservation strategies. A coordinated approach, implemented diligently from 10:00 hrs to 17:00 hrs daily, is the key to preserving India's wildlife heritage for future generations.", "normalised": "Finally, enforcing wildlife protection laws stringently is non-negotiable.
