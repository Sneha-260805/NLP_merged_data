Crop raiding by elephants and livestock depredation by predators can lead to retaliatory killings, undermining conservation efforts. Effective mitigation strategies, such as building elephant-proof trenches and providing compensation for livestock losses, are vital. The Forest Rights Act of two thousand and six (F R A) recognizes the rights of tribal and forest-dwelling communities, potentially leading to better resource management if implemented effectively."}
