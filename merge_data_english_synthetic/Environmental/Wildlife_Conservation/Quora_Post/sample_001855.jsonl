However, conserving tigers isn't just about tigers. They are apex predators, and their health reflects the health of the entire ecosystem. A decline in tiger population often signifies deeper issues like habitat loss and prey depletion.", "normalised": "Think of the majestic tiger, India's national animal.

Imagine the conflict when elephants, like those roaming near Kerala's forests, venture into farmlands in search of food, leading to human-animal conflict.", "normalised": "Loss of habitat due to deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization are major threats.

Support organizations working on the ground, practice responsible tourism when visiting wildlife reserves (arrive by 16:00 hrs to maximize viewing opportunities!), and advocate for policies that prioritize wildlife conservation. Our collective future depends on the health of our planet and its incredible biodiversity. Let's strive to protect it for generations to come. Even small changes, such as reducing plastic usage, can contribute.", "normalised": "What can you do?
