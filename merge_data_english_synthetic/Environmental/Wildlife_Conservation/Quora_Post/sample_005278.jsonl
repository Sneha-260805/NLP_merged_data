It’s not just about saving tigers (though Project Tiger, launched in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three, is a huge success story!), it's about protecting entire ecosystems. Think of the Western Ghats, home to the Lion-tailed Macaque and numerous endemic species. If we don't protect their habitat, we risk losing them forever."}

Reduce your carbon footprint. Educate yourself and others. Report illegal wildlife trade. Even small actions, like planting native trees in your garden, can contribute. Remember, the future of India's incredible wildlife depends on us. We can all make a difference before two thousand and twenty five. Consider visiting a national park during the off season, say after fifteenth june. Bookings usually open at ten o'clock. The Indian Forest Service (I F S) also plays a vital role, training dedicated officers for wildlife management. The next I F S exam might be conducted sometime around twenty eighth may two thousand and twenty four.
