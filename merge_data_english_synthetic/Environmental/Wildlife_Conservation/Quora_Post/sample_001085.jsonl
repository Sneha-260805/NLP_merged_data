{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is becoming increasingly critical, particularly in a biodiverse country like India. It's not just about saving majestic creatures like the Bengal tiger or the Indian elephant; it's about maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystems. When species disappear, the consequences ripple through food chains, impacting agriculture, water resources, and even human health.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is becoming increasingly critical, particularly in a biodiverse country like India.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: India’s forests, like those in the Western Ghats and the Sunderbans, provide vital ecosystem services. They regulate water cycles, prevent soil erosion, and are home to countless species, many still undiscovered. Losing these areas means losing natural solutions to climate change and resources essential for rural communities who depend on them for their livelihoods.", "normalised": "Think about it: India's forests, like those in the Western Ghats and the Sunderbans, provide vital ecosystem services.

{"unnormalised": "What can we, as individuals, do? We can support sustainable tourism, reduce our consumption of products that contribute to deforestation (like palm oil), and educate ourselves and others about the importance of conservation. Remember the film *Sherni* starring Vidya Balan? It beautifully highlights the complex challenges faced by forest officers working to protect wildlife in the face of human-animal conflict. Simple actions like reporting illegal wildlife trade or participating in citizen science initiatives can make a real difference. Let's all do our part to secure a future where wildlife thrives alongside us. The preservation of our natural heritage is a responsibility we all share.", "normalised": "What can we, as individuals, do?
