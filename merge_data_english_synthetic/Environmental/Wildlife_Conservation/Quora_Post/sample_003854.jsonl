Forests in the Western Ghats, for example, regulate rainfall, prevent soil erosion, and provide clean water – vital for agriculture and millions of people. Losing species can trigger cascading effects, destabilizing entire ecosystems.", "normalised": "Why is it so important?

Habitat loss due to urbanization and agriculture, poaching for illegal wildlife trade (rhino horns, tiger skins), and human-wildlife conflict are all major threats. Organisations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) are working hard on research and conservation efforts. Local communities also play a critical role. Initiatives like eco-tourism, properly managed, can generate income and incentivize conservation.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, of course.
