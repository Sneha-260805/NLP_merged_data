Effective strategies require a multi-pronged approach.", "normalised": "Firstly, habitat protection is crucial. Designating and maintaining Protected Areas like national parks (for example, Jim Corbett National Park) and wildlife sanctuaries is vital. Reducing human encroachment through sustainable development initiatives in buffer zones, like promoting eco-tourism benefiting local communities, is key. Think of projects like Project Tiger, launched on first april one thousand nine hundred and seventy three – a significant effort targeting tiger conservation."}

The Wildlife Institute of India (W I I) in Dehradun plays a critical role here. Studying species behavior, population dynamics, and threats helps in formulating targeted conservation plans. Many surveys are carried out between six hours and eighteen hours daily."}
