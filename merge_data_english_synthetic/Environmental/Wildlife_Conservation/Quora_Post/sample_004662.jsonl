Healthy populations of pollinators like bees and butterflies are essential for agriculture – remember how crucial the honeybee was for the survival of the village in the film *Swades*? Declining vulture populations, initially caused by diclofenac use, resulted in increased feral dog populations and subsequent rabies outbreaks – a stark reminder of interconnectedness.", "normalised": "Think about it: forests provide us with clean air and water.

Even small actions, when multiplied across millions, can make a real difference. Understanding the importance of biodiversity, the threats it faces, and the actions we can take is the first step towards ensuring a future where both humans and wildlife thrive. India's rich natural heritage is our responsibility to protect. Let's work together to ensure that future generations can witness the majesty of a Bengal tiger roaming free, the vibrant colors of a peacock displaying its plumage, and the serene beauty of the Himalayan ecosystem.", "normalised": "What can *you* do?
