Loss of pollinators, for instance, could severely impact agricultural productivity, costing Rs. in billions. We all have a role to play, whether it's supporting ethical tourism, reducing our carbon footprint, or advocating for stricter environmental regulations. Protecting our green spaces, even small areas like your backyard measuring just 100 sq ft, can contribute. Let's preserve India's natural heritage for future generations.", "normalised": "We need to understand that wildlife conservation isn’t just a sentimental cause; it is intricately linked to our economic prosperity.
