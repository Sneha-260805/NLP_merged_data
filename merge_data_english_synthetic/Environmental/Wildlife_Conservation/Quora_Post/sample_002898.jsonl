{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation in India faces a multi-pronged challenge, demanding urgent and coordinated action.", "normalised": "One major hurdle is habitat loss due to relentless encroachment for agriculture, infrastructure projects like roads and dams, and urbanization. For instance, the fragmentation of forests in the Western Ghats, traditionally home to the Lion-tailed Macaque, severely impacts their gene flow and long-term survival. Think of the proposed highway expansions cutting through critical tiger corridors – a disaster waiting to happen."}

As populations grow and habitats shrink, encounters between humans and animals like elephants, tigers, and leopards become more frequent, often resulting in crop damage, livestock depredation, and even human casualties. The recent incident in Kerala, where a wild elephant died after consuming pineapple filled with explosives, highlights the cruelty and consequences of this conflict."}

The illegal trade in ivory, rhino horn, tiger skins, and pangolin scales continues to decimate populations. Despite efforts by organizations like the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (W C C B), poaching incidents are still reported regularly, especially in regions like Kaziranga National Park. Let's not forget the rise in online poaching crimes since two thousand and twenty."}

This includes strengthening protected area management, promoting sustainable land use practices, engaging local communities in conservation efforts, and enforcing stricter laws against poaching and wildlife trafficking. Projects like Project Tiger (launched on the first of April nineteen seventy three) need constant monitoring and adaptation to the changing environment. Public awareness campaigns, such as those conducted by the World Wildlife Fund-India (W W F-India) at two post meridian on the twenty sixth of January two thousand and twenty three, also play a vital role in fostering a sense of responsibility towards wildlife conservation. Remember the Chipko movement – a reminder of the power of community-led conservation."}
