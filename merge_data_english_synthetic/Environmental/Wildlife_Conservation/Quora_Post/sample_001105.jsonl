{"unnormalised": "Remember the film \"Sherni\"? It highlighted the complexities of wildlife conservation and the challenges faced by forest officers like Vidya Vincent. We need more awareness and a shift in attitude – from viewing wildlife as a threat to recognizing its intrinsic value and its vital role in our survival. Supporting organizations working on the ground, advocating for stronger environmental policies, and making conscious choices in our daily lives – these are all ways we can contribute to a more sustainable future for both wildlife and ourselves. The survival of tigers, elephants, and countless other species ultimately depends on our collective action. Let's not fail them.", "normalised": "Remember the film \"Sherni\"?
