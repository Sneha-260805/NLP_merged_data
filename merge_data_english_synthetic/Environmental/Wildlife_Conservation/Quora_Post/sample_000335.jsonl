For example, declining vulture populations, once common in Rajasthan, led to increased feral dog populations and disease outbreaks.", "normalised": "Think about it: each species plays a vital role in its ecosystem.

Reducing our carbon footprint, supporting sustainable tourism, and avoiding products made from endangered animals are small steps that can make a big difference. Even planting native trees in your backyard (even a small 100 sq ft area helps!) provides habitat for local wildlife. Donating Rs. 500 to a credible wildlife conservation NGO can also contribute significantly.", "normalised": "But conservation isn't just the responsibility of experts. We can all contribute.
