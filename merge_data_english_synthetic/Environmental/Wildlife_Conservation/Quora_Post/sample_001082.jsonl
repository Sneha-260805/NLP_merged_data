{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is a critical aspect of environmental protection, especially in biodiverse countries like India. It's more than just saving cute animals; it's about maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems. Think of the Sunderbans, home to the majestic Bengal tiger. Its presence dictates the health of the entire mangrove ecosystem, impacting everything from fish populations to storm surge protection for coastal communities.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is a critical aspect of environmental protection, especially in biodiverse countries like India.

{"unnormalised": "Why is this so important? Loss of wildlife can trigger cascading effects. For example, decline in vulture populations (prompted by diclofenac use in cattle, a devastating issue documented extensively) led to increases in feral dog populations and, consequently, rabies outbreaks. Protecting wildlife also preserves genetic diversity, offering potential solutions for future challenges like climate change adaptation and disease resistance.", "normalised": "Why is this so important?
