Habitat destruction due to deforestation for agriculture and infrastructure projects (like new highways covering hundreds of km) poses a significant challenge. Poaching, driven by the demand for wildlife products (e.g., ivory, tiger skins), further decimates populations.", "normalised": "India is home to iconic species like the Bengal tiger, the Asiatic elephant, and the Indian rhinoceros, all facing numerous threats.
