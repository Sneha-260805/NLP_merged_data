{"unnormalised": "India, a land rich in biodiversity, faces significant wildlife conservation challenges. Habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion is a major concern. Think of the shrinking forests of the Western Ghats, crucial for species like the Lion-tailed Macaque. Encroachment for development, particularly around tiger reserves, like the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, disrupts wildlife corridors.", "normalised": "India, a land rich in biodiversity, faces significant wildlife conservation challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives like Project Tiger, strict enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and the establishment of protected areas, including national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, are vital. NGOs like the Wildlife Trust of India are also heavily involved in rescuing injured animals, conducting research, and raising awareness. Even small contributions, like donating Rs. 500 to a local conservation charity, can make a difference. Public awareness campaigns are crucial, especially targeting rural communities that live in close proximity to wildlife, starting ideally on 15/08 every year.", "normalised": "Government initiatives like Project Tiger, strict enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act of one thousand nine hundred and seventy two, and the establishment of protected areas, including national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, are vital.
