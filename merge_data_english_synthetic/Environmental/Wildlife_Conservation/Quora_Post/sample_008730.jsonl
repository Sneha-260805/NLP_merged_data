{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: each species has a specific job in the ecosystem. Loss of even one species can create a ripple effect, disrupting food chains and leading to cascading consequences like increased agricultural pests or reduced water quality. For example, the decline in vulture populations, largely due to diclofenac poisoning around 2006-2007, led to outbreaks of diseases and increased feral dog populations, impacting human health and requiring intervention from institutions like the BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society).", "normalised": "Think of it like this: each species has a specific job in the ecosystem.
