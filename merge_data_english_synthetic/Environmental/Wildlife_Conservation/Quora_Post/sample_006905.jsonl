These animals aren’t just beautiful; they play crucial roles in maintaining ecological balance. Tigers, for instance, control deer populations, which prevents overgrazing that can damage forests.", "normalised": "India is home to a breathtaking array of species, from the majestic Bengal tiger in the Sunderbans to the snow leopard in the Himalayas.
