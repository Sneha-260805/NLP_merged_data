{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation in India faces multifaceted challenges, ranging from habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development (like new highways cutting through forests) to human-wildlife conflict and poaching. Specifically, tiger poaching for traditional medicine remains a significant concern despite efforts like Project Tiger initiated in 1973. Encroachment on elephant corridors in states like Assam also fuels conflict, impacting local communities and elephants alike.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation in India faces multifaceted challenges, ranging from habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development like new highways cutting through forests to human-wildlife conflict and poaching.

{"unnormalised": "Innovative solutions are emerging, though. The use of drones for monitoring wildlife populations and anti-poaching patrols is gaining traction. Community-based conservation initiatives, where local communities are empowered to protect wildlife, are proving effective.

We must also ensure that development projects incorporate rigorous environmental impact assessments and prioritize minimizing negative impacts on wildlife habitats. This includes investing in eco-bridges to allow wildlife to safely cross roads and railway lines. Protecting our wildlife is not just about preserving biodiversity; it’s about securing a sustainable future for all.", "normalised": "Celebrating festivals like Onam, which emphasizes harmony with nature and cherishing biodiversity, can also promote environmental awareness among the masses.
