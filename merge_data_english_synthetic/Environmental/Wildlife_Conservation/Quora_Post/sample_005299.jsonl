{"unnormalised": "Why does wildlife conservation matter? Ecosystems thrive on delicate balances. The extinction of a single species can trigger a cascade effect, disrupting entire food chains and impacting human livelihoods. Consider the role of tigers in maintaining the health of forest ecosystems; their absence leads to overgrazing by herbivores, impacting vegetation and water sources.", "normalised": "Why does wildlife conservation matter?

Stronger enforcement of existing laws, increased funding for conservation projects, and greater public awareness are crucial. Educating children about the importance of wildlife, perhaps even incorporating conservation themes into celebrations like Onam showcasing the region’s flora and fauna, can foster a sense of responsibility towards our natural heritage. We need to protect not just the majestic tiger, but also the smallest of insects contributing to the delicate ecosystem. Investing in scientific research to understand species' behavior and needs, even spending Rs. 50 crores more annually, is essential for effective conservation strategies. The Sunderbans, a delicate mangrove ecosystem spanning over 10,000 km, needs continuous monitoring and protection against rising sea levels and human encroachment.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.
