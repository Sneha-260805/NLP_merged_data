One crucial strategy is strengthening protected areas like national parks (for example, Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand) and wildlife sanctuaries. This involves improved anti-poaching patrols, habitat management (controlling invasive species like Lantana), and community engagement to mitigate human-animal conflict."}
