{"unnormalised": "India, with its incredible biodiversity – from the snow leopards of the Himalayas to the Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans – has a particularly crucial role to play. Losing species weakens the intricate web of life, affecting pollination, seed dispersal, and even clean water resources. Imagine a world without the majestic elephants dispersing seeds in our forests, or the vultures cleaning up carcasses, preventing disease.", "normalised": "India, with its incredible biodiversity – from the snow leopards of the Himalayas to the Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans – has a particularly crucial role to play.

{"unnormalised": "Consider Project Tiger, launched on 01/04/1973, a prime example of a successful conservation effort. It has significantly boosted tiger populations in reserves like Ranthambore National Park. However, challenges remain. Human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss due to urbanization, and poaching continue to threaten wildlife. For instance, the proposed linear infrastructure projects near the Western Ghats put immense pressure on elephant corridors.", "normalised": "Consider Project Tiger, launched on first April nineteen seventy three, a prime example of a successful conservation effort.

{"unnormalised": "Individuals can contribute too. Supporting organizations like the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) or the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), practicing responsible tourism, and advocating for stronger environmental policies are all crucial. Remember that every small action, from reducing plastic consumption (which often ends up in wildlife habitats) to reporting wildlife crime, can make a difference. Educate yourself, and at 17:00 hrs on 12/10/2024, maybe attend a webinar by the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) on sustainable forestry practices. The future of India's incredible wildlife depends on all of us, not just the government or conservationists. The time to act is now, at 09:30 hrs.", "normalised": "Individuals can contribute too.
