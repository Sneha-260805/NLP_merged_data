Establishing and maintaining protected areas like national parks (e.g., Kaziranga in Assam, known for its rhino population) and wildlife sanctuaries is crucial. Effective implementation of laws like the Wildlife Protection Act of one thousand nine hundred and seventy two is vital to combat encroachment and habitat destruction.
