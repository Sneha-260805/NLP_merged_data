This includes strengthening anti-poaching measures, like those currently implemented near Kaziranga National Park, and actively working with local communities to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility. Projects like Project Tiger, launched on 1st April 1973, have shown demonstrable success, but require continuous adaptation and investment.", "normalised": "Effective conservation requires a multi-pronged approach.

Regulations like those under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, need rigorous enforcement. Educating the public, particularly the younger generation, about the importance of wildlife conservation is also vital. Events like the \"Van Mahotsav\" observed annually since 1950, help raise awareness about the need for tree planting and environmental protection.", "normalised": "Furthermore, promoting sustainable tourism practices is crucial.

The next generation of forest officers, graduating at around 14:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, need the knowledge and skills to manage these resources effectively. Failing to protect our wildlife heritage will have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the environment but also the socio-economic well-being of communities that depend on these resources.
