Habitat loss due to urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural expansion are major threats. Imagine the impact of a 500 sq ft construction project on a vital wildlife corridor! Poaching for ivory, rhino horns, and tiger skins continues to be a problem, despite stringent laws.

Consider responsible tourism that benefits local communities and minimizes environmental impact. Educate yourself and others about the importance of wildlife conservation. Even small actions, like reducing your carbon footprint and avoiding products made from endangered species, can make a difference. Donating even Rs. 500 to a reputable NGO can contribute to their conservation efforts. Remember, protecting our wildlife is protecting our future. Let's ensure future generations can witness the majestic Bengal Tiger roam free.", "normalised": "But what can you do? Plenty!
