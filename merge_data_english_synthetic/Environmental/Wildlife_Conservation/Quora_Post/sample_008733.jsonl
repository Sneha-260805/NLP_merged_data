Effective conservation requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes strengthening anti-poaching measures (like those initiated by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau on twenty-sixth january two thousand and six), creating and managing protected areas (such as Jim Corbett National Park established in nineteen thirty-six), and promoting sustainable livelihoods for communities living near wildlife habitats.
