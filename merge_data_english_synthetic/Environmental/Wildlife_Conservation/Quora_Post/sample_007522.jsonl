{"unnormalised": "India, a land of incredible biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation. Habitat loss due to rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion is a primary concern. The encroachment of forests for tea plantations in Assam and Kerala, and the expansion of agricultural lands near national parks like Bandipur National Park, severely impacts wildlife populations.", "normalised": "India, a land of incredible biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government, along with various NGOs, is actively working to address these issues. Project Tiger, for instance, has significantly contributed to tiger conservation. Efforts are being made to create wildlife corridors to facilitate animal movement and reduce habitat fragmentation. Community-based conservation programs, involving local communities in protecting wildlife in exchange for sustainable livelihood options, are also gaining traction. Strict enforcement of anti-poaching laws and awareness campaigns are crucial. Furthermore, sustainable development practices that minimize the impact on natural resources, such as eco-tourism, are being promoted.", "normalised": "The Indian government, along with various N G O s, is actively working to address these issues.

The Forest Survey of India (FSI) plays a vital role in monitoring forest cover and biodiversity, providing crucial data for conservation planning. Rs. 1000 crore have been allocated in the last budget for wildlife conservation initiatives. We need more such focused interventions to protect our precious wildlife.", "normalised": "Just as we celebrate Onam with a grand feast, including delicacies like avial and payasam, we must also dedicate ourselves to safeguarding the natural heritage of India for future generations.
