Similarly, removing species from an ecosystem disrupts the delicate balance. This can lead to consequences like increased pest outbreaks, reduced pollination, and even climate change.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: imagine a cricket team.

{"unnormalised": "On 05/06/2023, I attended a webinar by the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) on community-based conservation. It emphasized the importance of involving local communities like the tribals of Bastar in protecting wildlife. These communities often have a deep understanding of the local ecology and can be invaluable partners in conservation efforts. We need more such inclusive approaches. The next biodiversity convention is scheduled at 14:00 hrs on 20/09/2024. Let's hope for concrete actions there. Every effort counts, big or small. Start today, because tomorrow, at 10:00 am on 26/01/2025, might be too late for some species.", "normalised": "On fifth june two thousand and twenty three, I attended a webinar by the I I F M on community-based conservation.
