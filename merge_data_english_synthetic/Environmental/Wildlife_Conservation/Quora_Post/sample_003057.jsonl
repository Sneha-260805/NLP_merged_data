The expansion of NH44 and other infrastructure projects needs careful environmental impact assessments to minimize disruption to wildlife corridors. Poaching, driven by illegal wildlife trade, decimates populations of tigers, elephants, and rhinoceros, despite dedicated efforts by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.

This includes strengthening protected areas like the Jim Corbett National Park, promoting community-based conservation initiatives involving local communities like the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan, and investing in research and monitoring. Institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) play a crucial role. The \"Project Tiger,\" initiated on 01/04/1973, continues to be a vital component of our conservation strategy. We also need stricter enforcement of laws and international cooperation to combat wildlife trafficking. The upcoming conference on biodiversity in Bhopal at 11:00 hrs on 26/01/2025 presents an opportunity to further these efforts. A collective commitment is necessary to safeguard India's natural heritage and contribute to global conservation goals.", "normalised": "Effective conservation requires a multi-pronged approach.
