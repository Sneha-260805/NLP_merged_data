Every small action, from reducing your carbon footprint to supporting ethical wildlife tourism, makes a difference. Let's ensure future generations get to experience the richness of India's wildlife. For instance, the Bengal tiger population has risen to over 2967 in the past few years, and continued conservation efforts can boost that number. We need continued dedication from everyone.", "normalised": "Celebrating festivals like Onam with a conscious effort to reduce waste and support local artisans promoting eco-friendly products also contributes indirectly to conservation.
