Even celebrating festivals like Onam with an awareness of our environmental impact – reducing plastic waste, for instance – makes a difference. Let's ensure future generations can enjoy the rich wildlife heritage of India, and not just read about it in textbooks. We need to think beyond our plates of delicious biryani and remember the interconnectedness of everything.", "normalised": "Imagine a future where spotting a Great Indian Bustard, once common, becomes a thing of the past.
