Consider the vulture crisis of the early 2000s, when diclofenac (a veterinary drug) decimated vulture populations, leading to an increase in feral dog populations and subsequent disease outbreaks.", "normalised": "Why is it so important?

Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade (rhino horns, tiger bones etc.), also poses a significant threat. Climate change, pollution (Rs. 500 fines are hardly a deterrent, are they?), and human-wildlife conflict further exacerbate the problem.", "normalised": "What threatens our wildlife?

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Support organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun, which conducts research and trains wildlife managers. Advocate for stronger environmental regulations and stricter enforcement against poaching. Educate yourself and others. Remember the powerful message of \"Jungle Book\"? Appreciate the beauty and importance of our natural world. Even simple things like reducing your carbon footprint and avoiding products made from endangered species can make a difference. Let’s work together to protect India's incredible wildlife for future generations.", "normalised": "What can we do?
