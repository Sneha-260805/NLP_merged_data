Loss of even a single species can have cascading effects. Imagine removing a crucial support beam from a building – it weakens the entire structure.", "normalised": "Why should we care?

Simple actions like avoiding products made from endangered species or supporting sustainable tourism can make a difference. Let’s strive to protect our magnificent wildlife, from the majestic tiger in Bandhavgarh National Park to the colourful birds of Keoladeo National Park. Every action, no matter how small, counts towards preserving our planet's incredible biodiversity for decades and even centuries to come. Remember, \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" - the world is one family, including its flora and fauna.", "normalised": "On a personal level, you can practice responsible consumption, reduce your carbon footprint, and educate others about the importance of wildlife conservation.
