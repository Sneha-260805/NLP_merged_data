{"unnormalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation? It's the practice of protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats. This involves a multi-faceted approach, including habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, community involvement, and scientific research. Institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) play a pivotal role in research and training wildlife professionals.", "normalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation?

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest threats to Indian wildlife is habitat loss. As cities and agricultural lands expand, the natural homes of animals like the Royal Bengal Tiger and the Indian Elephant are fragmented and reduced. This can lead to increased human-animal conflict, as desperate animals venture into human settlements in search of food and water.", "normalised": "One of the biggest threats to Indian wildlife is habitat loss.

{"unnormalised": "Community involvement is also vital. Many local communities live alongside wildlife and their traditional knowledge is invaluable for conservation. Programs that provide alternative livelihoods and incentivize conservation efforts can ensure the long-term sustainability of these initiatives. For example, eco-tourism initiatives in places like Periyar National Park offer financial benefits to local communities while simultaneously promoting responsible tourism.", "normalised": "Community involvement is also vital.

{"unnormalised": "What can you do? Support organizations working on wildlife conservation. Reduce your consumption of products that contribute to deforestation. Educate yourself and others about the importance of protecting our wildlife. Even small actions, like planting native trees in your garden (imagine a grove of 100 sq ft!), can make a difference. Remember, preserving India’s wildlife is not just the government’s responsibility, it's everyone's. Dr. Salim Ali, the \"Birdman of India,\" inspires us to champion this cause. Let's work towards a future where wildlife thrives alongside us, enriching our lives and landscapes for Rs. 0 investment, just a commitment.", "normalised": "What can you do?
