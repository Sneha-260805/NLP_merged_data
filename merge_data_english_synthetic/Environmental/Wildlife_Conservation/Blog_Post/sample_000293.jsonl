{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Ever stopped to think about the incredible array of animals we share this planet with? From the majestic tigers roaming the Sundarbans to the tiny insects buzzing in our backyard gardens, wildlife is a vital part of our ecosystem and frankly, makes the world a much more interesting place. But here’s the thing: a lot of these creatures are facing serious threats. That's why wildlife conservation is so incredibly important.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it. Deforestation for agriculture and development is shrinking habitats faster than ever. Imagine building your house and suddenly finding out your land is being used for a shopping mall. That's kinda what's happening to a lot of animals! Poaching, too, is a major issue. Rhinos are hunted for their horns (used in traditional medicine, sadly), elephants for their ivory, and tigers for their skin - all for illegal trade. Dr. Sharma at the Wildlife Institute of India says that in the last 5 years, rhino poaching alone has cost India Rs. 100 crore.", "normalised": "Think about it.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Well, a lot! Supporting organizations like the WWF-India, or the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is a great start. They’re on the ground, working to protect habitats, combat poaching, and educate communities. Even small actions like reducing our plastic consumption, because it often ends up polluting wildlife habitats, especially in the seas, is crucial. Consider planting native trees. This small act provides food and shelter for local animals and birds and increases the green cover.", "normalised": "What can we do? Well, a lot!

{"unnormalised": "Conservation efforts also mean protecting existing wildlife reserves and creating new ones. The Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, spread across a massive 3,728 sq km, is a testament to that commitment. But it needs constant vigilance. We need stronger laws and stricter enforcement to protect our wildlife from poachers and habitat destruction.", "normalised": "Conservation efforts also mean protecting existing wildlife reserves and creating new ones.
