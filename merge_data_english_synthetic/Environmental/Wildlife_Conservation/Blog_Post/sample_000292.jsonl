Then there’s poaching, driven by illegal trade that puts a price on these creatures’ heads. Did you know that rhinoceros horn fetches a ridiculous amount of money, leading to the near extinction of certain rhino populations? It's heartbreaking.", "normalised": "Think about it.

They conduct research, train forest officers, and work with local communities to promote conservation. Project Tiger, launched back in 1973, is a prime example of a successful conservation effort. We celebrated 15/08/1947 with independence, now we need to ensure wildlife has the same.", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Well, a lot!

{"unnormalised": "But conservation isn't just the job of government agencies. We, as individuals, have a role to play. We can support eco-tourism initiatives that benefit local communities and wildlife. We can make conscious choices to reduce our impact on the environment - things as simple as reducing our carbon footprint or not buying products made from endangered species. Maybe even volunteer with a local NGO involved in wildlife rescue and rehabilitation! Imagine spending a day, say, at 09:00 hrs, helping clean enclosures at a rescue center.", "normalised": "But conservation isn't just the job of government agencies.
