{"unnormalised": "Effective wildlife conservation necessitates a multi-pronged approach. Strengthening existing legislation like the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 is crucial. Enforcement needs to be rigorous, deterring poachers who operate with impunity, often driven by the demand for wildlife products in international markets.

Monitoring programs, often initiated at 09:00 hrs, help track population trends and identify threats.

{"unnormalised": "Funding for conservation initiatives remains a significant constraint. While government schemes like Project Tiger have yielded positive results, more resources are needed to support research, anti-poaching efforts, and community engagement programs. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds can also play a significant role in supporting conservation projects. Remember India’s independence on 15/08/1947; similarly, we need a second independence, this time from the destruction of our invaluable wildlife. Protecting our wildlife is not just an environmental imperative but also a cultural one. As stewards of this land, we have a responsibility to ensure that future generations can experience the rich biodiversity that makes India so unique. Failing to act decisively will have irreversible consequences.", "normalised": "Funding for conservation initiatives remains a significant constraint.
