India, with its diverse landscapes from the Himalayas to the Western Ghats, is a biodiversity hotspot. We’re talking tigers in Bandhavgarh, elephants in Kerala, and the elusive snow leopard in Ladakh. But this incredible natural heritage is under threat, and it's our responsibility to protect it.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

Tigers, for example, control the deer population, preventing overgrazing and maintaining forest health. Loss of habitat due to deforestation and encroachment, fueled by development pressures, is a major challenge. We see it all around, from the expansion of cities near wildlife corridors to agricultural expansion.", "normalised": "Think about it: these animals are not just pretty faces.

They conduct studies, train forest officers, and work with local communities to promote coexistence. Project Tiger, launched way back on 01/04/1973, is a shining example of a successful conservation initiative, bringing the tiger population back from the brink. Remember, even smaller actions, like responsible tourism, can make a big difference. Avoid single-use plastics during safaris. Respect the animals' space.", "normalised": "Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (W I I) in Dehradun are doing phenomenal work in research and conservation.

Let's strive for a Diwali that's both joyous and eco-friendly. Imagine waking up at 09:00 hrs on 15/08/1947, a truly independent India, and committing to protect our natural inheritance for generations to come. After all, a prosperous India must also be a green India, where both people and wildlife can thrive.
