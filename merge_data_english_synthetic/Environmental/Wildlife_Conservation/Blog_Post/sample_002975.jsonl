{"unnormalised": "The success of wildlife conservation depends on a multi-faceted approach. It requires strict enforcement of anti-poaching laws to deter illegal hunting and trafficking. Habitat restoration efforts, such as afforestation and wetland conservation, are essential for providing suitable habitats for wildlife. Engaging local communities in conservation efforts is vital, as they often depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Providing them with alternative income sources and empowering them to participate in conservation initiatives can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility.", "normalised": "The success of wildlife conservation depends on a multi-faceted approach.

Educational programs, documentaries, and social media campaigns can help to educate people about the threats facing wildlife and inspire them to take action. Even small contributions, such as donating Rs. 100 to a conservation organization or reducing our carbon footprint, can make a difference. The legacy of figures like Kailash Sankhala, the \"Tiger Man of India,\" reminds us of the importance of passionate individuals driving conservation efforts. We must all do our part to protect India's rich natural heritage for future generations.
