Initiatives like Project Tiger, launched in 1973, have played a crucial role in bolstering tiger populations across the country. However, the challenge remains immense. Encroachment on forest land for agriculture and infrastructure development continues to shrink wildlife habitats, increasing the frequency of conflicts, particularly in rural areas.", "normalised": "The efforts of institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (W I I), Dehradun, are paramount in conducting research and training wildlife professionals.

Effective wildlife conservation requires a multi-faceted approach involving government agencies, NGOs, local communities, and individual citizens. The future of India's wildlife, and indeed the health of its ecosystems, depends on our collective commitment to this vital cause. This includes allocating sufficient Rs. to conservation projects, protecting key wildlife corridors, and increasing protected area coverage by at least 500 km. These steps will help ensure that future generations can experience the wonder and majesty of India's natural heritage.", "normalised": "Just as we celebrate Onam with its elaborate feasts and cultural richness, so too must we celebrate and protect the natural heritage of India.
