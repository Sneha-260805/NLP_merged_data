{"unnormalised": "Habitat loss, primarily due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development like new highways and mining projects covering several 100s of km, poses a significant challenge. Encroachment into forest areas disrupts natural ecosystems and leads to human-animal conflict. This is particularly evident in regions bordering protected areas, such as the Western Ghats, where elephant populations often raid agricultural lands. Poaching, driven by the illegal trade in wildlife products, remains a persistent menace. The demand for ivory, rhino horn, and tiger skins fuels organized crime syndicates, decimating populations of iconic species.", "normalised": "Habitat loss, primarily due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development like new highways and mining projects covering several hundreds of kilometer, poses a significant challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Effective wildlife conservation requires a multi-faceted approach. Strengthening protected area networks, such as the Jim Corbett National Park or the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, is crucial for safeguarding critical habitats. Community participation is also vital. Engaging local communities, offering alternative livelihoods, and raising awareness about the importance of conservation can foster a sense of stewardship. Initiatives like Joint Forest Management (JFM) have demonstrated success in empowering local communities to protect forests and wildlife.", "normalised": "Effective wildlife conservation requires a multi-faceted approach.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, stringent enforcement of wildlife protection laws is essential. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides a legal framework for conservation efforts, but its effective implementation depends on the vigilance and dedication of enforcement agencies. Investment in research and monitoring is also necessary to understand population dynamics, track movement patterns, and assess the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) play a crucial role in conducting research and training wildlife professionals.", "normalised": "Furthermore, stringent enforcement of wildlife protection laws is essential.
