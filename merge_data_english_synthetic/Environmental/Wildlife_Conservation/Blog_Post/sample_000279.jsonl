{"unnormalised": "One of the primary threats is habitat loss. Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion fragment crucial wildlife corridors. Imagine the impact on the Bengal tiger population in the Sundarbans when mangrove forests are cleared. Initiatives like Project Tiger, launched in 1973, aim to protect these vital habitats. These reserves need constant monitoring and proactive management, starting promptly at 09:00 hrs each morning.", "normalised": "One of the primary threats is habitat loss.

{"unnormalised": "Poaching remains a significant concern, driven by the illegal wildlife trade. Rhinos in Assam, elephants in Karnataka, and pangolins across the country are targeted for their horns, ivory, and scales. Strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws and international collaboration are essential to curb this menace. Institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun play a vital role in research and training to combat poaching. The impact of these institutions on wildlife conservation has been invaluable since their founding.", "normalised": "Poaching remains a significant concern, driven by the illegal wildlife trade.

{"unnormalised": "Human-wildlife conflict is another escalating problem, particularly in areas bordering protected forests. When animals stray into human settlements in search of food, it often leads to crop damage, livestock depredation, and even loss of human life. Implementing mitigation strategies such as electric fencing, creating alternative grazing areas, and raising awareness among local communities are crucial. On 15/08/1947, India gained independence and along with it, the responsibility to protect its natural heritage.", "normalised": "Human-wildlife conflict is another escalating problem, particularly in areas bordering protected forests.
