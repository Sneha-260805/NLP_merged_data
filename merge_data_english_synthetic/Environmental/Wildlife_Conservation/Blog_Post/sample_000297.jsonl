It’s about protecting the entire ecosystem. Think about the tiny insects, the fungi in the soil, the flow of the river – everything is interconnected.", "normalised": "We often hear about Project Tiger, launched back in nineteen seventy three, and rightly so!

Their numbers have dwindled drastically due to habitat loss, mainly conversion of grasslands into agricultural land. Places like Desert National Park in Rajasthan are crucial for their survival.

{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect we often overlook is community involvement. People living near forests, like the Baiga tribe near Bandhavgarh National Park, have invaluable traditional knowledge about the ecosystem. Involving them in conservation efforts, like anti-poaching patrols and eco-tourism, is key. A small financial investment of, say, Rs. 5000 for a community project can go a long way.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect we often overlook is community involvement.

We need to find sustainable solutions, like electric fences and improved crop storage, to minimize these conflicts.

From supporting local conservation initiatives to making conscious consumer choices (avoiding products that contribute to deforestation), every little bit counts. Let's ensure that future generations can marvel at the biodiversity of India, from the snow leopards in the Himalayas to the colourful coral reefs of Lakshadweep.", "normalised": "Ultimately, wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility.
