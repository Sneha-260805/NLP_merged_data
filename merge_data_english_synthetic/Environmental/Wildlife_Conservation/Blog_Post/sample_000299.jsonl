India, with its diverse landscapes from the Himalayas to the Western Ghats, is a treasure trove of wildlife. But sadly, this treasure is under threat, making wildlife conservation more critical than ever.", "normalised": "hey everyone! ever stopped to listen to the cacophony of sounds in a dense forest? or marvelled at the sight of a majestic tiger striding through the tall grass? india, with its diverse landscapes from the himalayas to the western ghats, is a treasure trove of wildlife. but sadly, this treasure is under threat, making wildlife conservation more critical than ever."}

{"unnormalised": "Habitat loss due to rapid urbanization and deforestation is a major culprit. Remember the uproar when they started constructing that highway through the forest near Bandipur National Park? It's happening all over! Poaching, driven by the insatiable demand for animal parts (think tiger skins or elephant tusks) also takes a heavy toll. Just last month, there was news of a poaching incident near Kaziranga National Park.", "normalised": "habitat loss due to rapid urbanization and deforestation is a major culprit. remember the uproar when they started constructing that highway through the forest near bandipur national park? it is happening all over! poaching, driven by the insatiable demand for animal parts (think tiger skins or elephant tusks) also takes a heavy toll. just last month, there was news of a poaching incident near kaziranga national park."}
{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, a lot! Supporting organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun, which conducts crucial research and training, is a great start. We can also push for stricter enforcement of wildlife laws. Remember Project Tiger, launched way back in 1973? It was a game-changer! We need similar initiatives, tailored to different species and ecosystems. The Govt. also released new guidelines on 01/01/2023 for eco-tourism activities.", "normalised": "so, what can we do? well, a lot! supporting organizations like the wildlife institute of india (W I I) in dehradun, which conducts crucial research and training, is a great start. we can also push for stricter enforcement of wildlife laws. remember project tiger, launched way back in nineteen seventy three? it was a game-changer! we need similar initiatives, tailored to different species and ecosystems. the government also released new guidelines on first january two thousand and twenty three for eco-tourism activities."}
{"unnormalised": "But conservation isn't just about government policies and scientific research. It's about changing our own behavior. Are we mindful of our consumption patterns? Do we support sustainable practices? Even small actions, like reducing our plastic use (which often ends up in animal habitats) or educating others about the importance of wildlife, can make a difference. Join a local conservation group or volunteer your time at a wildlife sanctuary. Maybe attend that talk on wildlife photography at the IIT Delhi at 14:00 hrs on 26/01/2024.", "normalised": "but conservation is not just about government policies and scientific research. it is about changing our own behaviour. are we mindful of our consumption patterns? do we support sustainable practices? even small actions, like reducing our plastic use (which often ends up in animal habitats) or educating others about the importance of wildlife, can make a difference. join a local conservation group or volunteer your time at a wildlife sanctuary. maybe attend that talk on wildlife photography at the I I T delhi at two P M on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four."}
