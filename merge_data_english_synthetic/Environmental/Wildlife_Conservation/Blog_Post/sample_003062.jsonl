{"unnormalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation? It’s the practice of protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats. It's about ensuring that future generations can witness the splendor of our natural heritage. In India, this takes many forms, from establishing national parks and wildlife sanctuaries like the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, famous for its one-horned rhinoceros, to implementing anti-poaching measures.", "normalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation?

{"unnormalised": "One significant challenge is the increasing pressure on wildlife habitats due to rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion. The shrinking forest cover forces animals to venture into human settlements, leading to conflict and often, tragic consequences for both humans and animals. Initiatives like eco-bridges, which are dedicated wildlife corridors connecting fragmented habitats, are helping to mitigate this problem.", "normalised": "One significant challenge is the increasing pressure on wildlife habitats due to rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion.

{"unnormalised": "We can all contribute to wildlife conservation. Simple acts like supporting eco-friendly products, avoiding the consumption of products made from endangered species, and educating ourselves and others about the importance of biodiversity can make a difference. Imagine if every household in a 1000 sq ft house contributed just Rs. 100 per year towards conservation – it would create a substantial fund.", "normalised": "We can all contribute to wildlife conservation.
