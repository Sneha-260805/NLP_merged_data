{"unnormalised": "The challenges are multifaceted. Habitat loss due to deforestation and encroachment for agricultural expansion and infrastructure development, such as the expansion of NH-44, continues to threaten numerous species. Poaching, driven by illegal wildlife trade, remains a persistent threat, particularly for iconic species like elephants for their ivory and rhinos for their horns, fetching exorbitant Rs. in international markets. Human-wildlife conflict, especially in areas bordering protected reserves like the Bandipur National Park, poses a significant threat to both human lives and animal populations.", "normalised": "The challenges are multifaceted.

Strengthening protected area networks, such as expanding the area of the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary in Rajasthan, is crucial. Community-based conservation programs, like those implemented by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), empower local communities to become active participants in conservation efforts, fostering a sense of ownership and stewardship. Scientific research, conducted by institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), provides valuable insights into species ecology, behavior, and population dynamics, informing conservation management decisions.", "normalised": "Effective conservation strategies require a multi-pronged approach.

Protecting our wildlife ensures the health and resilience of our ecosystems, which provide vital ecosystem services, including clean water, pollination, and climate regulation. It safeguards our cultural heritage, rooted in a deep respect for nature. A future where tigers roam free in our forests and elephants grace our landscapes is a future worth striving for. Let us work together to ensure that future generations inherit a nation teeming with wildlife, a land of unparalleled natural beauty. Think of the loss of 100 sq ft of habitat – multiplied across the nation. The time to act is now.", "normalised": "Ultimately, wildlife conservation is not merely an environmental issue but a socio economic imperative.
