{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses a range of practices aimed at protecting wild animal and plant species, along with their habitats. It goes beyond simply preserving individual animals; it focuses on maintaining healthy ecosystems that support biodiversity. This involves understanding the complex interactions between species and their environment. Think of the tiger in the Sundarbans, intricately linked to the mangrove ecosystem and the local human communities who depend on its resources.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses a range of practices aimed at protecting wild animal and plant species, along with their habitats.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the decline of wildlife populations in India. Habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion is a major concern. Poaching for illegal wildlife trade, especially for items like tiger skins or elephant tusks (demand of which can reach Rs. 5 Lakhs per piece!), further decimates populations. Climate change also poses a significant threat, altering habitats and disrupting established ecosystems. Human-wildlife conflict, particularly around protected areas, also creates challenges for both communities and wildlife.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the decline of wildlife populations in India.

Strengthening anti-poaching measures, expanding protected areas, promoting sustainable land-use practices, and raising awareness among the public are all essential. Education initiatives are vital for changing attitudes and fostering a sense of responsibility towards our natural heritage. Remember, we must act now to protect India's wildlife for future generations. Let us commemorate the independence day of India, 15/08/1947, by recommitting ourselves to safeguarding our natural heritage. Further planning meeting for protection strategies for rhinoes in Kaziranga is scheduled at 09:00 hrs on 26/10/2024.
