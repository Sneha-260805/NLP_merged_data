{"unnormalised": "India, a land of immense biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation. From the snow leopards of the Himalayas to the Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans, our natural heritage is under increasing threat. Habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion, poaching driven by illegal wildlife trade, and human-wildlife conflict are major contributing factors.", "normalised": "India, a land of immense biodiversity, faces significant challenges in wildlife conservation.

{"unnormalised": "The importance of preserving this biodiversity cannot be overstated. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance, supporting vital ecosystem services like pollination and seed dispersal, and contributing to tourism revenue. The economic value derived from ecotourism in places like Jim Corbett National Park runs into several crores of Rs. annually.", "normalised": "The importance of preserving this biodiversity cannot be overstated.

{"unnormalised": "Numerous initiatives are underway to address these challenges. Project Tiger, launched in 1973, has been instrumental in increasing the tiger population, albeit with ongoing challenges related to habitat connectivity and poaching. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, plays a vital role in research and training in wildlife management. Conservation efforts extend beyond iconic species to encompass a wide range of flora and fauna, including the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard in Rajasthan and the diverse avifauna of the Western Ghats.", "normalised": "Numerous initiatives are underway to address these challenges.
