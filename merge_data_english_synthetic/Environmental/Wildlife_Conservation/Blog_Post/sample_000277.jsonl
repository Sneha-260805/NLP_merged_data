{"unnormalised": "What exactly does wildlife conservation entail? It involves protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats. This can include habitat restoration, anti-poaching efforts, community engagement, and scientific research. Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun play a vital role in training wildlife managers and conducting research to inform conservation strategies. Think of Project Tiger, launched in 1973, a landmark initiative that helped bring back the tiger population from the brink of extinction.", "normalised": "What exactly does wildlife conservation entail?

The park's success in protecting this iconic species demonstrates the effectiveness of dedicated conservation efforts. Remember the celebrations on 15/08/1947? We need that same spirit of freedom and dedication towards protecting our natural heritage. We must remember that success isn't guaranteed; vigilance is key. Let's strive to achieve more milestones like the Rhino Vision 2020 program, even beyond its initial timeframe.
