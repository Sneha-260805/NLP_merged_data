{"unnormalised": "India, a land of vibrant cultures and breathtaking landscapes, is also a biodiversity hotspot. From the majestic Bengal tiger in the Sunderbans to the elusive snow leopard in the Himalayas, our nation is home to a remarkable array of wildlife. However, rapid urbanization, habitat loss, and poaching pose significant threats to these precious creatures. That's where wildlife conservation comes in – a dedicated effort to protect and preserve our natural heritage for future generations.", "normalised": "India, a land of vibrant cultures and breathtaking landscapes, is also a biodiversity hotspot.

{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses a wide range of activities, including habitat restoration, anti-poaching patrols, community engagement, and scientific research. Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun play a crucial role in conducting research and training wildlife professionals. Projects like Project Tiger, launched on 1st April 1973, have demonstrated the effectiveness of focused conservation efforts. The initiative aims to protect the big cat & has seen successes, though challenges remain.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses a wide range of activities, including habitat restoration, anti-poaching patrols, community engagement, and scientific research.

{"unnormalised": "Community participation is vital. In many rural areas, communities depend on forests for their livelihoods. Educating them about sustainable resource management and involving them in conservation efforts is crucial. The Bishnoi community in Rajasthan, known for their deep reverence for nature, serve as inspiring examples. Their actions often predate government efforts, highlighting the power of indigenous conservation practices.", "normalised": "Community participation is vital.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of conservation extends beyond protecting individual species. Healthy ecosystems provide vital services such as clean water, pollination, and climate regulation. For example, the conservation of the Western Ghats ensures water security for millions of people. Ignoring the need for conservation is akin to jeopardising these important ecological services.", "normalised": "The impact of conservation extends beyond protecting individual species.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges persist. Poaching continues to be a serious threat, often driven by international demand for wildlife products. Addressing this requires strict law enforcement and international cooperation. The Forest Department often begins patrols early, at 09:00 hrs, hoping to catch poachers off guard. Habitat fragmentation due to infrastructure development like roads & railways also needs urgent attention. We need sustainable development models which take into account the needs of both humans and wildlife.", "normalised": "Challenges persist.
