Challenges remain, from habitat loss due to infrastructure projects like new roads or railway lines cutting through forests (sometimes many 100s of km long) to poaching motivated by illegal trade worth Rs. millions.", "normalised": "There are incredible stories of success, like Project Tiger which has helped increase the tiger population in India.
