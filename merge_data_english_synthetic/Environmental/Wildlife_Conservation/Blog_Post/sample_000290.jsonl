{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is of paramount importance in India, a land blessed with immense biodiversity. From the snow leopards of the Himalayas to the tigers of the Sundarbans, our ecosystems are teeming with life that is under constant threat. The preservation of these species and their habitats is not merely an environmental concern; it is intrinsically linked to our cultural heritage and economic stability.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is of paramount importance in India, a land blessed with immense biodiversity.

{"unnormalised": "The challenges are multifaceted. Habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, urbanization, and infrastructure development like highways and mining projects pose a significant threat. Human-wildlife conflict, particularly near protected areas like Jim Corbett National Park and Kaziranga National Park, often leads to tragic consequences for both animals and local communities. Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade, continues to decimate populations of iconic species like elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns (valued at Rs. in lakhs).", "normalised": "The challenges are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Community participation is crucial for the long-term success of conservation initiatives. Engaging local communities in ecotourism and providing them with alternative livelihood options can help reduce their dependence on forest resources and foster a sense of ownership and responsibility towards wildlife.

{"unnormalised": "The success of wildlife conservation hinges on a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of threats, involves all stakeholders, and integrates scientific knowledge with traditional ecological knowledge. We must strive to create a future where wildlife and humans can coexist harmoniously, ensuring the survival of India's rich natural heritage for generations to come. One small act of planting trees on a 100 sq ft plot can make a difference. Dr. Ravi Chellam and other experts continuously advocate for more funding and manpower to effectively protect our endangered species. The stakes are too high to ignore.", "normalised": "The success of wildlife conservation hinges on a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of threats, involves all stakeholders, and integrates scientific knowledge with traditional ecological knowledge.
