Every small act counts. Remember, a world with flourishing wildlife is a world that thrives! It's not just about saving animals; it's about saving ourselves and ensuring a healthy planet for generations to come. Maybe next time you are enjoying a delicious plate of biryani, take a moment to think about the ecosystem that provides all of us with the sustenance to enjoy it. We have to start now to ensure a brighter future for them."}
