{"unnormalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation? It's the practice of protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats. This includes preserving ecosystems, preventing poaching, and mitigating human-wildlife conflict. Why is it so important? Well, healthy ecosystems provide essential services like clean air and water, pollination, and climate regulation. When wildlife populations decline, these services are compromised, impacting human well-being.", "normalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation?

{"unnormalised": "One major threat is habitat loss. As urban areas expand and forests are cleared for agriculture, animals lose their homes and sources of food. Poaching remains a persistent problem, driven by the illegal wildlife trade. Animals like elephants and rhinos are targeted for their ivory and horns, pushing them closer to extinction. Human-wildlife conflict also contributes to the problem, especially in areas where human settlements encroach on wildlife habitats. Imagine a farmer in Rajasthan struggling to protect his crops from nilgai (blue bulls).", "normalised": "One major threat is habitat loss.

Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun conduct research and training to support conservation efforts.

{"unnormalised": "The future of India's wildlife depends on our collective efforts. We can support conservation by educating ourselves and others about the importance of biodiversity, advocating for responsible land-use planning, and supporting organizations working on the ground. Even small actions like reducing our consumption and supporting sustainable tourism can make a difference. Consider visiting a national park like Kaziranga National Park (perhaps around 09:00 hrs to maximize your chances of wildlife sightings), but always do so responsibly, respecting the animals and their environment.", "normalised": "The future of India's wildlife depends on our collective efforts.
