{"unnormalised": "One of the cornerstones of wildlife conservation in India is the establishment of protected areas. National Parks like Kaziranga in Assam, known for its rhino population, and Bandipur National Park in Karnataka, a tiger reserve, provide safe havens for animals. These parks are managed by the Forest Department and receive support from organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun. The WII conducts research and training to improve conservation efforts across the country.", "normalised": "One of the cornerstones of wildlife conservation in India is the establishment of protected areas.

{"unnormalised": "Project Tiger, launched in 1973, is a prime example of a successful conservation initiative. It aimed to protect the tiger population, which had dwindled alarmingly. The project involved creating tiger reserves, strengthening anti-poaching measures, and relocating villages from core areas. Thanks to these efforts, tiger numbers have seen a positive trend in recent years. Similar projects are underway for other endangered species like the snow leopard in the Himalayas.", "normalised": "Project Tiger, launched in nineteen seventy three, is a prime example of a successful conservation initiative.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Human-wildlife conflict is a major issue, particularly in areas bordering forests. Farmers often face crop raiding by elephants and other animals, leading to retaliatory killings. Finding sustainable solutions that benefit both humans and wildlife is essential. This involves initiatives like building elephant-proof walls, providing compensation for crop damage, and educating local communities about conservation.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Community involvement is crucial for long-term success. Encouraging local communities to participate in conservation efforts and providing them with alternative livelihoods can reduce their dependence on forest resources and promote coexistence. Often, at village panchayat meetings held weekly at 09:00 hrs, discussions take place on ways to mitigate elephant conflict near locations like Coorg.", "normalised": "Community involvement is crucial for long-term success.

{"unnormalised": "Further, stricter laws and enforcement are needed to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade. The conviction rate for wildlife crimes remains low, emboldening poachers. Strengthening the legal framework and increasing penalties can act as a deterrent. For example, a recent raid on 26/01/2023 in Delhi resulted in the seizure of ivory worth Rs. 50 lakhs, highlighting the ongoing problem.", "normalised": "Further, stricter laws and enforcement are needed to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the future of India's wildlife depends on our collective commitment to conservation. By supporting protected areas, promoting sustainable development, and raising awareness about the importance of wildlife, we can ensure that these magnificent creatures continue to thrive in their natural habitats for generations to come. Let us all play our part in safeguarding our wild heritage, even by contributing a small donation to local NGOs working to preserve grasslands that are vital habitats, even plots as small as 5 km, are incredibly crucial.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the future of India's wildlife depends on our collective commitment to conservation.
