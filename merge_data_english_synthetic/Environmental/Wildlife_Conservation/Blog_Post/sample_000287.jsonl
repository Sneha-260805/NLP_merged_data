{"unnormalised": "India, a land of rich biodiversity and ancient cultural reverence for nature, faces an escalating crisis concerning its wildlife. From the snow-capped Himalayas to the tropical rainforests of Kerala, a myriad of species are under threat due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Effective wildlife conservation strategies are no longer optional; they are an imperative for ecological balance and future sustainability.", "normalised": "India, a land of rich biodiversity and ancient cultural reverence for nature, faces an escalating crisis concerning its wildlife.

{"unnormalised": "The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun plays a pivotal role in research and training, generating vital data for conservation planning. Yet, translating research into effective action remains a challenge. The increasing encroachment of human settlements into wildlife corridors, especially near protected areas like the Jim Corbett National Park, exacerbates human-animal conflict. Stories of elephants straying into villages, causing damage to crops and property, are becoming increasingly common.", "normalised": "The Wildlife Institute of India (W I I) in Dehradun plays a pivotal role in research and training, generating vital data for conservation planning.

{"unnormalised": "Poaching, driven by the international demand for wildlife products, continues to decimate populations of iconic species like tigers and rhinos. While organizations like TRAFFIC India work diligently to combat illegal wildlife trade, stronger enforcement measures and stricter penalties are crucial. Dr. Ravi Chellam, a leading conservation biologist, emphasizes the importance of community participation in conservation efforts. Local communities, often dependent on forest resources, must be incentivized to protect wildlife and their habitats.", "normalised": "Poaching, driven by the international demand for wildlife products, continues to decimate populations of iconic species like tigers and rhinos.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the impact of climate change on wildlife is undeniable. Altered rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme weather events disrupt ecosystems and threaten the survival of many species. For instance, the Gangetic dolphin, a vital indicator species, is facing increasing threats from pollution and habitat degradation in the Ganga River.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the impact of climate change on wildlife is undeniable.

{"unnormalised": "Successful conservation requires a multi-pronged approach involving government agencies, NGOs, and local communities. Increased investment in habitat restoration, anti-poaching patrols, and awareness campaigns is essential. The allocation of Rs. 100 crores for Project Tiger in the recent budget is a positive step, but more resources are needed. Protecting even small fragments of habitat, say a few thousand sq ft, can make a difference for localized populations. The cultural significance of animals like the tiger, often depicted in Hindu mythology, can be leveraged to promote conservation among the Indian populace. Ultimately, the future of India's wildlife hinges on our collective commitment to protect it.", "normalised": "Successful conservation requires a multi-pronged approach involving government agencies, N G O s, and local communities.
