Habitat loss due to deforestation, poaching driven by demand (you know, for things like rhino horns – completely unnecessary!), and the ever-increasing human population are all taking a toll. Think about it – forests are being cleared for agriculture and infrastructure projects at an alarming rate. This directly impacts the animals that call these places home, leaving them with nowhere to go.", "normalised": "But, let's be honest, this treasure is under threat.

Finding solutions that benefit both humans and animals is crucial. One approach is creating wildlife corridors that allow animals to move freely between fragmented habitats. Another is working with farmers to implement deterrents like solar-powered fences.", "normalised": "Then there's the issue of human-animal conflict.
