{"unnormalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation? It encompasses the strategies and practices aimed at protecting wild animal and plant species and their habitats. This includes preventing extinction, maintaining healthy populations, and restoring degraded ecosystems. Dr. Salim Ali, the \"Birdman of India,\" dedicated his life to understanding and conserving Indian birdlife, setting a powerful example for future generations.", "normalised": "What exactly is wildlife conservation?

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the decline of wildlife populations. Habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion is a major concern. Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade, continues to decimate populations of tigers, elephants, and rhinos.

Local communities often bear the brunt of human-wildlife conflict and are therefore key stakeholders in conservation efforts. Initiatives like ecotourism, which provides alternative livelihoods and encourages responsible tourism, can incentivize communities to protect wildlife.", "normalised": "Community involvement is paramount for successful conservation.

Healthy ecosystems provide essential services such as clean air and water, pollination, and climate regulation. By protecting wildlife, we are also protecting ourselves. Remember, even small actions like reducing our carbon footprint or supporting sustainable practices can contribute to a healthier planet. Every patch of green, be it a small 100 sq ft backyard garden attracting butterflies or the vast expanse of the Sunderbans, plays a role. Conserving our wildlife is not just an environmental responsibility; it is a cultural imperative. The Rs. 10 coin, featuring an Indian rhinoceros, serves as a constant reminder of the precious biodiversity we must strive to protect.", "normalised": "Conservation is not just about protecting individual animals; it's about safeguarding entire ecosystems.
