{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is habitat loss. Expanding agriculture, infrastructure development (like new highways cutting through forests), and urbanization encroach upon animal territories. For example, the conversion of grasslands in Rajasthan impacts the Great Indian Bustard population. Another threat is poaching, driven by the illegal trade in animal parts. Ivory from elephants, rhino horns, and tiger skins fetch high prices in international markets, incentivizing poachers despite stringent laws.", "normalised": "One major challenge is habitat loss.

{"unnormalised": "Conservation efforts include establishing protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Project Tiger, launched in 1973, is a prime example of a successful species-specific conservation program. It has significantly increased tiger numbers through habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, and community involvement. Jim Corbett National Park, named after the renowned hunter-turned-conservationist, is a testament to this success.", "normalised": "Conservation efforts include establishing protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

{"unnormalised": "Community participation is key. Local communities often bear the brunt of human-wildlife conflict, with crop raiding and livestock depredation being common issues. Sustainable solutions, like providing alternative livelihoods and implementing effective compensation schemes for losses, are essential to gain local support for conservation initiatives. Consider the work being done in villages near Kaziranga National Park in Assam, where eco-tourism provides income and incentivizes wildlife protection.", "normalised": "Community participation is key.

{"unnormalised": "Protecting our wildlife is not just about preserving individual species; it's about maintaining the ecological balance of our ecosystems. Losing a keystone species can have cascading effects, impacting the entire food chain. We all have a role to play, from supporting conservation organizations to making conscious choices that reduce our environmental footprint. Even small actions, like refusing to buy products made from endangered species or advocating for sustainable development policies, can make a difference. Let's ensure that future generations can marvel at the beauty and diversity of India's wildlife for years to come. Securing a few sq ft of land for a forest will have far reaching implications. The investment of Rs. 100 today could help secure a wild future for generations to come.", "normalised": "Protecting our wildlife is not just about preserving individual species; it's about maintaining the ecological balance of our ecosystems.
