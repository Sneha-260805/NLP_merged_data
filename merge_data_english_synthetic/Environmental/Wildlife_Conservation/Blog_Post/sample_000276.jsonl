{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild animal species and their habitats to ensure their long-term survival and to educate future generations. This involves a multi-pronged approach including habitat preservation, anti-poaching efforts, and community involvement. The efforts are not merely altruistic; a healthy wildlife population plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and supporting vital ecosystem services.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild animal species and their habitats to ensure their long term survival and to educate future generations.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain. The pressure on land for agriculture and infrastructure development continues to shrink wildlife habitats.
