National Parks like Kaziranga in Assam and Bandipur in Karnataka play a vital role in safeguarding these areas. Project Tiger, launched in 1973, has been instrumental in boosting tiger populations, proving that focused conservation strategies can yield positive results.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect is habitat preservation.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Human-animal conflict, particularly around forest fringes, poses a significant threat to both humans and wildlife. Farmers often suffer crop losses due to wildlife intrusion, sometimes retaliating, leading to tragic outcomes. Initiatives focusing on creating buffer zones and providing alternative livelihoods are crucial for mitigating this conflict.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Community participation is also key. Local communities often depend on forests for their livelihoods. By involving them in conservation efforts and providing them with alternative income opportunities like ecotourism, we can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility. For example, in some villages, women are trained as guides, earning Rs. 500 per day, thereby reducing their dependence on forest resources.", "normalised": "Community participation is also key.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility. From individuals reducing their carbon footprint to policymakers enacting strong legislation, every action counts. Preserving our natural heritage is not just about protecting animals; it’s about ensuring a healthy and sustainable future for generations to come. A small step like planting a tree (even in your 100 sq ft garden) can contribute significantly. Let's all contribute to conserving India's incredible wildlife.", "normalised": "Ultimately, wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility.
