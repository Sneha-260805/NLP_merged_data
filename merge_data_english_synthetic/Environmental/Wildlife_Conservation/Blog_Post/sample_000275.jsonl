{"unnormalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses the protection of wild animal and plant species, along with their habitats. This involves a multi-pronged approach, addressing issues like habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun play a vital role in research and training, providing the scientific basis for effective conservation strategies.", "normalised": "Wildlife conservation encompasses the protection of wild animal and plant species, along with their habitats.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant threats to wildlife is habitat loss, often driven by deforestation for agriculture and infrastructure development. Imagine the impact on elephant corridors in Kerala when forests are cleared for tea plantations. Addressing this requires careful land-use planning and promoting sustainable development practices. Project Tiger, launched on 01/04/1973, is a prime example of a successful conservation initiative focused on preserving tiger habitats.", "normalised": "One of the most significant threats to wildlife is habitat loss, often driven by deforestation for agriculture and infrastructure development.

{"unnormalised": "Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade, continues to decimate populations of iconic species like rhinos and elephants. Stricter enforcement of anti-poaching laws, along with community involvement, is crucial to curb this menace. The implementation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 was a landmark moment in India's conservation history, providing a legal framework for protecting our wildlife.", "normalised": "Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade, continues to decimate populations of iconic species like rhinos and elephants.

{"unnormalised": "Human-wildlife conflict, particularly around protected areas, poses a significant challenge. Incidents of crop raiding by elephants or livestock depredation by tigers can lead to retaliatory killings. Mitigating this requires proactive measures like building barriers, providing compensation for damages, and promoting awareness among local communities. Imagine a scenario at 17:00 hrs on a summer evening; a tiger strays into a village near the Bandipur Tiger Reserve, highlighting the urgency of such mitigation strategies.", "normalised": "Human-wildlife conflict, particularly around protected areas, poses a significant challenge.

By supporting sustainable practices, respecting wildlife habitats, and advocating for stricter conservation policies, we can ensure that future generations can also marvel at the beauty and diversity of India's natural heritage. The task ahead may seem daunting, but every small action contributes towards a larger goal. Think about reducing your carbon footprint or donating Rs. 500 to a local conservation NGO. Every bit helps.", "normalised": "The success of wildlife conservation depends on our collective commitment.
