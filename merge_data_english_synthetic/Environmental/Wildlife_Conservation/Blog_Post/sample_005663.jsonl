{"unnormalised": "The primary reasons for dwindling wildlife populations are habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion, poaching for illegal wildlife trade, and human-animal conflict. Think of the shrinking corridors for elephants, leading to increased encounters with villagers near places like Valparai.", "normalised": "The primary reasons for dwindling wildlife populations are habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion, poaching for illegal wildlife trade, and human-animal conflict.

{"unnormalised": "So, what are the solutions? Firstly, habitat preservation is key. Protecting forests, grasslands, and wetlands is paramount. Government initiatives like Project Tiger, launched in 1973 to conserve the Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), have shown considerable success. We also need to focus on creating protected areas – National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Bandipur National Park in Karnataka, for example, plays a vital role in tiger conservation.", "normalised": "So, what are the solutions? Firstly, habitat preservation is key.

Ullas Karanth, a renowned conservationist, has significantly contributed to research on predator-prey relationships and conflict mitigation strategies.", "normalised": "Thirdly, mitigating human-animal conflict involves developing strategies like building fences, providing alternative grazing lands, and raising awareness among communities.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, scientific research plays a vital role. Institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) conduct research to understand animal behavior, population dynamics, and habitat requirements. This knowledge informs conservation policies and management practices. The success of any conservation effort depends on the collective action of individuals, government agencies, and NGOs. We can all contribute by supporting sustainable practices, raising awareness, and advocating for stronger environmental policies. Every little bit counts – from reducing our carbon footprint to avoiding products made from endangered species. Even planting native trees in our gardens (even a small patch of 100 sq ft) can help. Remember, protecting our wildlife is not just about saving animals; it's about safeguarding our natural heritage and ensuring a sustainable future. The economic cost of inaction will far outweigh the Rs. spent on these projects now. Protecting our wildlife is protecting India.", "normalised": "Furthermore, scientific research plays a vital role.
