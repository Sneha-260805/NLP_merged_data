Poaching, driven by the illegal wildlife trade (often involving items like rhino horns worth Rs. 1,00,00,000 per kg), is another huge problem. Climate change is also impacting their habitats and food sources. Think about the Sundarbans delta, a fragile ecosystem threatened by rising sea levels, putting the Bengal tiger at risk.", "normalised": "But sadly, many of these animals are facing serious threats.

Organizations like the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) are doing amazing research and working on strategies to protect endangered species. Local communities also play a vital role.

Let's commit to protecting these animals, not just for ourselves, but for future generations. We need to ensure that our children get to see these amazing creatures thriving in their natural habitats, not just in pictures or documentaries. It’s our responsibility to conserve our rich natural heritage. Let’s get to it! Even planting a few indigenous trees near your home can help local birds and insects.
