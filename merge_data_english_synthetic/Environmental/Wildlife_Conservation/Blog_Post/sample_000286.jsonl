Initiatives such as Project Tiger, launched in 1973, have played a pivotal role in protecting the majestic Bengal tiger, a symbol of India's natural heritage. Yet, challenges remain. Encroachment on forest lands for agriculture and infrastructure development continues to fragment habitats, leading to increased interaction between humans and animals, often with tragic consequences.", "normalised": "Doctor Asad Rahmani, a renowned ornithologist, has emphasized the importance of community involvement in conservation efforts.

This data informs conservation policies and guides management practices. Strengthening anti-poaching measures is equally important. Forest guards, often working in challenging conditions, risk their lives to protect wildlife from illegal hunting. Providing them with adequate resources and training is essential.", "normalised": "Furthermore, scientific research plays a vital role.
