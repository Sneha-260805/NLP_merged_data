Innovative solutions like waste-to-energy plants and decentralized composting units are being explored across the country. Recently, a pilot project in Bengaluru successfully converted 5 tonnes of mixed waste into usable fuel pellets daily. Further research and investment are vital to develop sustainable and scalable waste management systems for a cleaner and healthier Bharat.", "normalised": "However, segregation at source remains a major hurdle.
