The adoption of the 3R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) at the household level, especially during festivals when waste generation surges, is crucial. A recent study by TERI indicates that composting initiatives covering just 1000 sq ft can significantly reduce landfill burden in residential areas. The cost of effective waste management programs can range from Rs. 500 to Rs. 2000 per household annually, depending on the location and services offered. Further incentivizing citizens and promoting private sector participation are vital for a cleaner, greener India. Let's strive for 'Kachra Mukt Bharat'.", "normalised": "The Swachh Bharat Mission has undoubtedly raised awareness, but implementation needs strengthening.
