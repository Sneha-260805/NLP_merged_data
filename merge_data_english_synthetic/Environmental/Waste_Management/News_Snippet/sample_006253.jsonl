Innovative projects are exploring the use of black soldier fly larvae to process organic waste, producing valuable animal feed. Simple steps, like composting leftover biryani instead of discarding it, can collectively contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment. The goal is to achieve a 'zero waste' status across Indian cities, requiring concerted efforts from individuals, communities, and government bodies. The current waste generation is estimated at approximately 62 million tonnes annually, costing the nation Rs. 133 billion.", "normalised": "Furthermore, incorporating food waste into biogas plants could generate clean energy and reduce methane emissions.
