The goal is to minimize landfill usage and create a circular economy, transforming waste into valuable resources for future generations.", "normalised": "\"Effective waste segregation at source is crucial,\" says Doctor Sharma, an environmental scientist at T E R I. \"Citizens need to actively participate in separating wet and dry waste to facilitate efficient processing.\" Initiatives like \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\" are pivotal in driving awareness, but long-term, sustainable solutions are needed to manage the rupee twenty thousand crore waste management sector effectively.
