For example, food waste from large gatherings during festivals like Onam, which often includes significant leftovers, can be effectively composted using these systems. IIT Madras is collaborating with local municipal corporations in Tamil Nadu to implement pilot projects using these technologies.", "normalised": "The research focuses on decentralized waste processing units capable of handling organic waste efficiently.

{"unnormalised": "One promising solution involves converting biodegradable waste into biogas for cooking and electricity generation, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Another focuses on creating nutrient-rich compost suitable for enriching soil, particularly useful for farmers in regions like Punjab struggling with soil degradation. Properly managed, waste isn't just refuse, it's a resource. Investing in modern techniques will improve sanitation & reduce costs of landfills by 50%. This comprehensive strategy offers a sustainable path towards a cleaner and healthier India.", "normalised": "One promising solution involves converting biodegradable waste into biogas for cooking and electricity generation, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
