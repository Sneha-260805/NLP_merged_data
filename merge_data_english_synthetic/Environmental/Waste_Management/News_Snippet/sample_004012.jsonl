Improved waste segregation at the source, alongside effective recycling programs, can reduce the burden on landfills and minimize environmental impact. Furthermore, innovative technologies like waste-to-energy plants, though costly at around Rs. 20 crore per MW, are also being explored to manage the overwhelming 2.7 million tonnes of waste generated monthly.", "normalised": "The government's Swachh Bharat Mission has spurred some improvements, but further investment in technology, infrastructure, and public awareness is crucial.
