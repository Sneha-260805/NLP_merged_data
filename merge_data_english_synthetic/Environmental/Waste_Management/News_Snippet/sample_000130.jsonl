A webinar on sustainable waste practices is scheduled for 17/11/2024 at 11:00 hrs, organized by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. One successful example is the implementation of community composting in Bengaluru's Jayanagar area, drastically reducing landfill waste. The impact assessment report is due on 15/08/2024. Experts believe that integrating traditional Indian knowledge of composting with modern technology holds immense potential for a cleaner future. Effective implementation and public participation are key to achieving a \"Zero Waste India\" by 2047.", "normalised": "Local municipalities are experimenting with decentralized waste processing units, reducing the burden on centralized facilities often located far from residential areas.
