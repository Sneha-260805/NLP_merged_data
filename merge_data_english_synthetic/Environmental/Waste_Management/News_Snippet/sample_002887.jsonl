Encouraging responsible consumption and reducing waste generation at the source is essential for building a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable India. The Yamuna River, heavily polluted due to waste discharge, is one such area which requires immediate attention - a task that requires a multi-pronged approach from industries to households and even the religious activities near ghats to reduce the area of pollution to less than 50 sq ft.", "normalised": "Proper waste management not only protects our environment but also offers economic opportunities through recycling and the creation of green jobs.
