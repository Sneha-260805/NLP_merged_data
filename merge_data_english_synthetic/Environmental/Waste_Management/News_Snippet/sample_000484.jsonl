Success stories are emerging from states like Kerala, where community-led initiatives focusing on composting kitchen waste, like leftover biryani and vegetable scraps, are gaining traction. These models demonstrate how reducing, reusing, and recycling can significantly minimize waste reaching landfills and promote a cleaner, healthier environment for all. Further research into biodegradable alternatives for packaging is crucial to tackle the plastic waste problem, estimated to be over 3.5 million tonnes annually.", "normalised": "Rupees two thousand crore has been allocated in the Union Budget for strengthening waste infrastructure in Tier two and Tier three cities.
