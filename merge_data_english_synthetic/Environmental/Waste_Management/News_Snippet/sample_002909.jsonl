The Ganga Action Plan also incorporates waste management strategies to prevent river pollution. Several start-ups are also developing solutions such as converting plastic waste into fuel and building materials, showcasing the potential of a circular economy. The project required an investment of Rs. 50 lakhs and reclaimed over 1000 sq ft of land previously used as a dumping ground. Let’s hope these initiatives keep gaining momentum.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain, including inadequate infrastructure and public awareness in some areas.
