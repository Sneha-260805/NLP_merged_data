Inadequate infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, remains a concern. Open dumping is still rampant, contributing to environmental pollution and health hazards. Public awareness and participation are often low. Segregation at source, despite being mandated, is poorly practiced. Financial constraints also hinder the adoption of advanced technologies. The implementation of robust waste-to-energy plants is also delayed due to environmental concerns and economic feasibility. The Ganga Action Plan initiated on fourteenth January nineteen eighty six, highlighting river cleaning efforts, serves as a reminder of the long-term commitment required. Moreover, timely execution as per municipal directives like collecting waste before nine zero zero hours is also often bypassed."}
