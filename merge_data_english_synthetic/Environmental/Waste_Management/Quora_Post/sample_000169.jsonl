{"unnormalised": "Currently, India generates approximately 62 million tonnes of waste annually, a figure projected to increase drastically with urbanization. A significant portion of this waste ends up in landfills like Ghazipur in Delhi, contributing to groundwater contamination and air pollution.

{"unnormalised": "One pressing concern is the lack of proper waste segregation at source. Many households and commercial establishments in cities like Mumbai and Chennai do not adequately separate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. This makes recycling efforts, already hampered by a lack of efficient facilities, even more difficult.", "normalised": "One pressing concern is the lack of proper waste segregation at source.

{"unnormalised": "The cost implications are also significant. Cities spend a considerable amount of their budgets, sometimes in the range of Rs. 500 Crores annually, on waste collection and transportation. Exploring innovative solutions like community-based waste management systems, as trialed in Kerala, could prove more cost-effective and sustainable.", "normalised": "The cost implications are also significant.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, tackling India's waste management crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government initiatives, corporate responsibility, and individual participation. Landfill sites spanning hundreds of acres (or thousands of sq ft) need rehabilitation and better management plans. Only then can we hope to create a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.", "normalised": "Ultimately, tackling India's waste management crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government initiatives, corporate responsibility, and individual participation.
