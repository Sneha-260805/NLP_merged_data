Encouraging households and businesses in cities like Delhi and Mumbai to separate waste into biodegradable, recyclable, and inert categories can significantly improve processing efficiency at waste treatment facilities. Awareness campaigns, possibly spearheaded by N G Os in collaboration with local municipalities, are essential for widespread adoption."}
