{"unnormalised": "Waste management is a pressing environmental challenge, particularly in densely populated countries like India. The sheer volume of waste generated daily, from household refuse to industrial byproducts, demands urgent and effective solutions. Uncontrolled waste accumulation leads to various environmental problems, including soil and water contamination, air pollution, and the spread of diseases.", "normalised": "Waste management is a pressing environmental challenge, particularly in densely populated countries like India.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes reducing waste generation at the source, promoting segregation of waste (e.g., biodegradable vs. non-biodegradable), implementing efficient collection and transportation systems, and developing appropriate disposal methods. Landfilling remains a common practice, but alternatives like waste-to-energy plants and composting are gaining traction. Local municipalities, like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), are experimenting with various pilot projects around waste segregation from 10:00 hrs to 17:00 hrs daily in specific wards.", "normalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach.
