{"unnormalised": "Inadequate waste management practices contribute to air and water pollution, soil contamination, and the spread of diseases. Open dumping, a common sight in many Indian cities, releases harmful greenhouse gases like methane, exacerbating climate change. Furthermore, leachate from landfills contaminates groundwater, impacting the health of communities dependent on this resource.", "normalised": "Inadequate waste management practices contribute to air and water pollution, soil contamination, and the spread of diseases.

{"unnormalised": "The Swachh Bharat Mission is a commendable initiative, but much more needs to be done. Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, coupled with technological innovations, is crucial to effectively address the waste management crisis. Consider the areas around the Yamuna River; the state of waste is disheartening. Ultimately, a cleaner India requires a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and the government. Improper waste disposal, even in a small area like 100 sq ft, can impact entire communities. The cost of inaction, estimated to be in the Rs. billions, far outweighs the investment needed for effective solutions. Landfills extending for km upon km are a stark reminder of the urgency of this issue.", "normalised": "The Swachh Bharat Mission is a commendable initiative, but much more needs to be done.
