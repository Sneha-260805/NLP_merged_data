{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India presents a complex set of challenges, compounded by rapid urbanization and population growth. One of the primary issues is the lack of effective waste segregation at source. Many households and commercial establishments in places like Mumbai or Delhi still fail to separate biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous waste, leading to inefficient processing at landfills.", "normalised": "Waste management in India presents a complex set of challenges, compounded by rapid urbanization and population growth.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, inadequate infrastructure for waste collection and transportation remains a significant hurdle. Numerous municipalities lack sufficient vehicles and manpower to ensure regular and timely waste removal, particularly in densely populated areas and slums like Dharavi. This leads to overflowing garbage bins and unsanitary conditions.", "normalised": "Secondly, inadequate infrastructure for waste collection and transportation remains a significant hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, open dumping continues to be a widespread practice, contributing to environmental pollution and health risks. Landfill sites are often poorly managed, leading to groundwater contamination and air pollution from methane emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, there’s a critical need for better implementation and enforcement of existing regulations, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. While these rules provide a framework for sustainable waste management, their effective application is often lacking due to bureaucratic hurdles and lack of awareness. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched on 02/10/2014 aimed to address these issues but requires sustained effort.", "normalised": "Fourthly, there’s a critical need for better implementation and enforcement of existing regulations, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, two thousand sixteen.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, promoting public awareness and encouraging behavioral change are essential for effective waste management. Initiatives like door-to-door campaigns and community engagement programs, perhaps spearheaded by institutions like IIT Bombay, can help raise awareness about waste segregation and responsible waste disposal practices. The target is to achieve complete segregation by 31/12/2024. The 14:00 hrs slot is generally suitable for such campaigns. These steps can significantly improve the scenario in the long run and create a cleaner, healthier environment for all.", "normalised": "Finally, promoting public awareness and encouraging behavioral change are essential for effective waste management.
