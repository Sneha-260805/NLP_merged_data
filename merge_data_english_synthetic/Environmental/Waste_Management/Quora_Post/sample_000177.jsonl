Separate your wet waste (kitchen scraps, vegetable peels - perfect for composting!) from dry waste (paper, plastic, metal). My didi, Priya, uses three different bins, labeled very clearly. Makes a world of difference."}

Even a small balcony can accommodate a composter. Think of all that vegetable waste you can turn into nutrient-rich soil for your plants! You can start vermicomposting like they do in Kerala's organic farms."}

Even starting at nine zero zero hours tomorrow morning can be a good start! We need to make it a habit. And if we can get companies to reduce packaging (rupees five less per packet would be great!), that would be amazing! My friend, Rajesh, is even trying to set up a waste management system in his village, fifty kilometer from Jaipur. Small steps, big impact!"}
