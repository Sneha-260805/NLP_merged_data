{"unnormalised": "**Question:** What are some pressing challenges and potential solutions for waste management in India?", "normalised": "Waste management in India presents significant environmental challenges, particularly in densely populated urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi. One pressing issue is the sheer volume of waste generated daily; estimates suggest several thousand tonnes in each major metro city. Open dumping, often practiced, leads to groundwater contamination and air pollution."}
{"unnormalised": "**Answer:**", "normalised": "Segregation at source remains a major hurdle. Public awareness campaigns, often conducted by N G O s like Chintan, are crucial, but need to be more effective in changing household practices. Many residents, even in relatively affluent areas, don't consistently segregate waste despite municipal guidelines."}

Financial incentives, say rupee five hundred for composting at home, could encourage participation. Educating children in schools about waste management from a young age, perhaps starting at nine o'clock in environmental awareness classes, is vital. Furthermore, ensuring adequate infrastructure for waste collection within a five kilometer radius of all settlements is critical. We need systemic changes to make a real impact by two thousand and thirty. The timeframe from notification on first January two thousand and sixteen, to enforcement of solid waste management rules has been slow, requiring urgent action."}
