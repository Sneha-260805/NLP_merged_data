{"unnormalised": "The issue of waste management in India is a complex and pressing environmental concern. Rapid urbanization, coupled with population growth, particularly in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, has led to an exponential increase in waste generation. Traditional methods of disposal, such as open dumping, are proving inadequate and detrimental to public health and the environment. These practices contaminate soil and groundwater, release harmful greenhouse gases, and contribute to the spread of diseases.", "normalised": "The issue of waste management in India is a complex and pressing environmental concern.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach. Source segregation is crucial, but requires public awareness campaigns and infrastructure development. Implementing efficient collection and transportation systems is also essential. Furthermore, investing in modern waste treatment technologies, such as composting, incineration, and waste-to-energy plants, is necessary to reduce landfill dependence.", "normalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach.
