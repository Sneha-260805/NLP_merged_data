Efficient waste management also contributes to economic growth by creating jobs in recycling and related industries. Each of us has a role to play; from segregating waste at home to supporting responsible waste management initiatives in our communities. Consider the environmental impact of your consumption habits and strive to reduce waste generation. Even small actions like using reusable bags and composting kitchen waste can make a difference. Implementing these changes across just 1000 sq ft in a community can demonstrate real, positive results. Rs. 500 spent on a home composter is a good investment!", "normalised": "proper disposal methods prevent contamination of soil and groundwater, safeguarding public health. efficient waste management also contributes to economic growth by creating jobs in recycling and related industries. each of us has a role to play; from segregating waste at home to supporting responsible waste management initiatives in our communities. consider the environmental impact of your consumption habits and strive to reduce waste generation. even small actions like using reusable bags and composting kitchen waste can make a difference. implementing these changes across just one thousand square feet in a community can demonstrate real, positive results. rupee five hundred spent on a home composter is a good investment!"}
