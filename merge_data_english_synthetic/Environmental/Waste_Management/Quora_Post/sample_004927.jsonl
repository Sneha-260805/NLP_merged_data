The sheer volume of waste generated daily, estimated at hundreds of tonnes in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, overwhelms existing infrastructure. Collection inefficiencies, particularly in densely populated areas like Dharavi, contribute to overflowing landfills and unsanitary conditions."}
{"unnormalised": "**What are the biggest challenges India faces in waste management, and what innovative solutions are being implemented?**", "normalised": "One significant hurdle is the lack of segregation at source. Much of the waste, including organic matter, recyclables, and hazardous materials, ends up mixed together, hindering efficient processing and resource recovery. This is further compounded by inadequate infrastructure for composting and recycling. Many municipalities lack the necessary equipment and manpower to handle the waste stream effectively. For example, the Bhalswa landfill in Delhi has far exceeded its capacity, posing serious environmental and health risks to nearby communities."}

Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission, launched on second october two thousand and fourteen, aim to improve cleanliness and sanitation across the country. Many startups are developing technologies for waste to energy conversion and advanced recycling. The I I T Kanpur is actively researching sustainable waste management practices. Community level composting initiatives, often driven by N G O s, are also gaining traction. Financial incentives are sometimes offered; for example, some municipalities offer rupees five per kilogram for segregated plastic waste delivered before five zero zero P M on Wednesdays. Furthermore, stricter regulations on industrial waste disposal, such as the notification issued on tenth january two thousand and sixteen by the M O E F C C, are crucial steps. Addressing this complex issue requires a concerted effort from individuals, communities, businesses, and government agencies."}
