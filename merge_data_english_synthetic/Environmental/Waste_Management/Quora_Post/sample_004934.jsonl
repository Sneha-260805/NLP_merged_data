Source segregation is paramount. Citizens need to diligently separate waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable at the household level. Campaigns promoting awareness, akin to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched on second October two thousand and fourteen, are crucial to fostering this habit."}

This includes increasing the number of processing plants employing technologies like composting, biomethanation, and waste-to-energy conversion. For example, the Deonar dumping ground in Mumbai has been a persistent problem; investing in modern processing facilities can significantly reduce reliance on such landfills."}

Regular monitoring and evaluation of waste management practices, perhaps conducted at two P M every quarter, will ensure effectiveness. Legislation must be enforced, and fines imposed on those who violate waste disposal regulations. Successful models from other countries, adapted to the Indian context, can also provide valuable insights. The cost of inaction, both environmentally and economically (estimated to be in rupees thousands crores annually), is simply too high."}
