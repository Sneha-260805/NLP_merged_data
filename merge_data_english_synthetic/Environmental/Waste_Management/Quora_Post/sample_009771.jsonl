{"unnormalised": "One promising technique is biomethanation, where organic waste is converted into biogas, a renewable energy source. Several municipalities, including Pune, are piloting this successfully. This reduces landfill burden and provides clean energy. Another innovation is the use of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) plants. These facilities process municipal solid waste to create a fuel source for cement plants and other industries. In Delhi, there are ongoing projects to improve RDF production and utilization.", "normalised": "One promising technique is biomethanation, where organic waste is converted into biogas, a renewable energy source.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, waste-to-art initiatives are gaining traction. Artists are creating sculptures and installations from recycled materials, raising awareness and promoting circular economy principles. IIT Madras is actively researching and developing efficient waste processing technologies. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has introduced stricter regulations, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, to ensure responsible waste disposal practices. The deadline for compliance with certain rules was 31/12/2023. Finally, technology like GPS tracking of waste collection vehicles (scheduled every morning at 09:00 hrs in many localities) enhances efficiency and accountability. These combined efforts, though still facing challenges, represent significant strides in addressing India's waste management crisis.", "normalised": "Moreover, waste-to-art initiatives are gaining traction.
