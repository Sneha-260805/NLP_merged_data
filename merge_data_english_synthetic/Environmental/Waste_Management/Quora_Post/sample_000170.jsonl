Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi has been working on such technologies. Financial incentives, including subsidies and tax benefits (Rs.), should be provided to encourage private sector participation. Effective implementation of existing regulations under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is also vital. Consider the case of Bengaluru; a better segregation strategy could reduce landfill burden. Creating localized solutions suited to the varied geography (from the Himalayas to the Deccan plateau) across India would be the key to its success. We can achieve significant improvements in waste management and create a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investing in innovative technologies, such as waste-to-energy plants and composting facilities, can transform waste into a valuable resource.
