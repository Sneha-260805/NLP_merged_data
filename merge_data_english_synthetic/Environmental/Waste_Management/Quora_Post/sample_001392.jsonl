Fines for illegal dumping or non-segregation can act as a deterrent. We can also draw inspiration from some European models for waste management. Initiatives like Extended Producer Responsibility (E P R), where manufacturers are responsible for managing the end-of-life of their products, can be very useful. The government aims to completely eradicate open defecation by two thousand and twenty five, requiring integrated waste management programs."}
