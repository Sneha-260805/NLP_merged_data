One significant issue is the sheer volume of waste generated daily, particularly in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi. Current infrastructure struggles to cope, leading to overflowing landfills and inadequate segregation at source. Many landfills exceed their capacity, posing environmental risks like groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions."}
