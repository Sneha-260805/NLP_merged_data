The Swachh Bharat Mission, launched on 02/10/2014, aims to improve cleanliness and sanitation across the country, including waste management.

{"unnormalised": "One innovative approach is the use of Decentralized Waste Management Systems, seen in some smaller towns and even within communities in larger cities. This involves processing waste locally, reducing the burden on centralised facilities and transportation costs (which can be quite high, say Rs. 5000 per truckload for 10 km in certain regions).", "normalised": "One innovative approach is the use of Decentralized Waste Management Systems, seen in some smaller towns and even within communities in larger cities.

{"unnormalised": "However, significant challenges remain. Open dumping and burning of waste are still prevalent practices, contributing to air and water pollution. Illegal dumping sites are a common sight along the Yamuna River and in many peri-urban areas. Enforcement of regulations remains weak in many states. It's a race against time, and improvements are necessary before 17:00 hrs on 15/08/2047, our 100th Independence Day!
