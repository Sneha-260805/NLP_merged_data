{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing issues is the inadequate infrastructure for waste collection and processing. Many cities, even metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi, struggle with overflowing landfills and inefficient waste segregation. This leads to environmental pollution, posing significant health risks to local communities, particularly the underprivileged residing near these sites. The Ghazipur landfill, a stark example, serves as a constant reminder.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing issues is the inadequate infrastructure for waste collection and processing.

{"unnormalised": "Another key challenge is the lack of public awareness and participation. While initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on 02/10/2014, have had some impact, widespread behavioral change regarding waste segregation at source is still lacking. Many households continue to mix biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, hindering efficient recycling processes.", "normalised": "Another key challenge is the lack of public awareness and participation.

Their contribution needs to be recognized and formalized.", "normalised": "Furthermore, informal waste pickers, often Dalits, play a crucial role in waste management, yet they often lack proper safety equipment and social security.

{"unnormalised": "Effective implementation of waste management policies, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, remains a hurdle. There's a need for stricter enforcement and greater accountability from local authorities. The delay in the completion of waste-to-energy plants across several cities, often exceeding timelines set on, say, 31/12/2023, highlights the challenges in project execution.", "normalised": "Effective implementation of waste management policies, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, two thousand and sixteen, remains a hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the increasing generation of plastic waste, especially single-use plastics, is a major concern. Developing viable alternatives and promoting circular economy principles are crucial. The 19:30 hrs deadline set by many RWAs for garbage collection sometimes goes unheeded, adding to the problem. Effective waste management requires a collaborative effort from individuals, communities, and governmental bodies, ensuring a cleaner and healthier future for India.", "normalised": "Finally, the increasing generation of plastic waste, especially single-use plastics, is a major concern.
