{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India faces significant hurdles despite government initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission launched on 02/10/2014. One major challenge is the sheer volume of waste generated daily, particularly in densely populated urban centers such as Mumbai and Delhi. Segregation at source remains woefully inadequate, leading to mixed waste reaching landfills and processing plants.", "normalised": "Waste management in India faces significant hurdles despite government initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission launched on second October two thousand and fourteen.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical issue is the lack of sufficient infrastructure for scientific waste disposal. Many smaller towns and cities lack proper landfills, and existing ones are often overloaded and poorly managed, posing serious environmental and health risks. Informal waste pickers, often from marginalized communities, play a vital role in recycling but operate in hazardous conditions without adequate protection or recognition.", "normalised": "Another critical issue is the lack of sufficient infrastructure for scientific waste disposal.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the public awareness regarding waste management best practices is lacking. Many households are unaware of the importance of segregation or proper disposal methods. Implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) by manufacturers is also crucial but faces challenges. We need stricter enforcement and public campaigns to improve participation.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the public awareness regarding waste management best practices is lacking.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the financial constraints faced by many municipal corporations hamper their ability to invest in modern waste management technologies. For example, setting up a proper waste-to-energy plant in a city like Chennai requires substantial investment. This is compounded by bureaucratic hurdles and delays in project approvals. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report dated 15/07/2023 highlighted the need for at least Rs. 1000 Cr investment in this sector by 2025. Effective solutions require a multi-pronged approach involving government, industry, and citizens working together, possibly starting with community-level segregation drives at 10:00 hrs every Sunday.", "normalised": "Finally, the financial constraints faced by many municipal corporations hamper their ability to invest in modern waste management technologies.
