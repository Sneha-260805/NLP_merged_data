If we don't separate dry and wet waste in our homes, like my grandmother taught me, it becomes almost impossible to efficiently recycle anything downstream.

Institutions like I I T Madras are working on innovative waste-to-energy solutions. We also need better public awareness campaigns. A Bollywood film highlighting the problems, like \"Toilet: Ek Prem Katha\" did for sanitation, could be a great step! Ultimately, effective waste management needs a multi-pronged approach: individual responsibility, government initiatives, technological advancements, and social justice. Unless we address all these factors, we'll continue to struggle with overflowing landfills and polluted environments."}
