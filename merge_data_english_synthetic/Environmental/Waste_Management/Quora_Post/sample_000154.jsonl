{"unnormalised": "Currently, India faces a massive waste generation problem, with cities struggling to cope with the sheer volume. Much of the waste ends up in overflowing landfills, leading to soil and water contamination. Unsegregated waste also contributes to the spread of diseases.

Government initiatives coupled with individual responsibility, starting at 09:00 hrs every day, can help us create a cleaner and healthier India by 2030. We need to learn from best practices implemented in cities like Indore, which has consistently ranked high in cleanliness surveys. Addressing this issue requires a collective effort, much like celebrating Diwali at 19:00 hrs, ensuring a bright and sustainable future for all.", "normalised": "Moving forward, stricter regulations, increased public awareness, and innovative technologies are all essential.
