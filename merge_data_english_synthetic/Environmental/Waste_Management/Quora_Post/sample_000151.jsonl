{"unnormalised": "We generate massive amounts of waste daily, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. This waste includes everything from household garbage (kooda) to industrial byproducts and electronic waste (e-waste), much of it ending up untreated. Improper disposal leads to soil and water contamination, releasing harmful greenhouse gasses, and breeding disease vectors.", "normalised": "We generate massive amounts of waste daily, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.

Imagine if every household in Delhi followed the guidelines: separate bins for biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable waste. That itself would be a significant step. Also, the informal sector plays a crucial role, with \"ragpickers\" (kabaadiwalas) collecting and sorting recyclables. We need to better integrate and support this sector.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges is the lack of effective segregation at source.
