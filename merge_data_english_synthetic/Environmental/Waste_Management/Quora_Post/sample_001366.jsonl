{"unnormalised": "Effective strategies include source segregation, composting, biogas production, and the implementation of engineered landfills. Furthermore, encouraging waste reduction at the source and promoting recycling initiatives, especially for plastics, is paramount. Research institutions like the TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) are actively involved in developing innovative waste treatment technologies suitable for the Indian context. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) faces enormous challenges in handling approx. 9000 metric tonnes of waste daily, requiring robust solutions and improved public participation.", "normalised": "Effective strategies include source segregation, composting, biogas production, and the implementation of engineered landfills.
