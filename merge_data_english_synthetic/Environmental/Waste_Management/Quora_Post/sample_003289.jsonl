{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India is a topic that should be on everyone’s mind, not just during Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. We, as a nation, generate mountains of waste daily, from bustling metropolises like Mumbai to smaller towns like Lucknow. The problem isn't just the visible overflowing landfills, it's the unseen environmental damage.", "normalised": "Waste management in India is a topic that should be on everyone’s mind, not just during Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

Separating biodegradable waste for composting, recyclable materials like paper, plastic, and metal, and hazardous waste (batteries, e-waste) makes a HUGE difference.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collective effort – from government policies to individual actions. Let's move beyond just cleaning streets to truly managing our waste responsibly. The future of our environment, and the health of our children, depends on it. Imagine a cleaner Delhi, a healthier Chennai. It's possible, but it requires action NOW. The cost of inaction is far greater than any investment in proper waste management infrastructure.", "normalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collective effort – from government policies to individual actions.
