Rapid urbanization, population growth, and changing consumption patterns have significantly increased waste generation, straining existing infrastructure and resources. A primary concern is the segregation of waste at source. Many households in cities like Mumbai and Delhi still mix wet and dry waste, complicating processing at municipal facilities. This is often due to lack of awareness and inconsistent enforcement of regulations like the Solid Waste Management Rules, two thousand and sixteen."}

Many landfills are overflowing and pose environmental and health risks. The Ghazipur landfill, for instance, is a stark reminder of this crisis. We need more investment in waste to energy plants and composting facilities. Innovative solutions being explored include the use of bio-methanation technology and decentralized waste management systems implemented at the community level, such as seen in some initiatives in Kerala."}

The informal sector often handles electronic waste, leading to unsafe recycling practices and environmental pollution. Strengthening Extended Producer Responsibility (E P R) and promoting formal e-waste recycling facilities like those being developed with I I T-Madras are crucial. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on second October two thousand and fourteen, has raised awareness, but sustained behavioral change and significant investment are required to truly transform India's waste management landscape by, say, two thousand and thirty."}

We need stringent monitoring, enforcement of existing laws, and community participation. Awareness campaigns starting at ten o'clock hours, fifth June two thousand and twenty four (World Environment Day) can play a vital role. Also, imposing rupee five hundred fine is not enough, strict monitoring and charging rupee five thousand fine can be effective for companies who are not following waste management rules."}
