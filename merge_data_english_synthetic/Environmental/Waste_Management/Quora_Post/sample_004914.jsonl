{"unnormalised": "Effective recycling programs are also vital. Investing in modern recycling infrastructure, specifically for plastics and e-waste (a growing concern) is essential. Informal waste pickers, often overlooked, play a crucial role and need to be integrated into formal waste management systems with fair wages and social security. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued numerous directives to improve e-waste management, with stricter regulations expected by 15/07/2024.", "normalised": "effective recycling programs are also vital. investing in modern recycling infrastructure, specifically for plastics and e-waste (a growing concern) is essential. informal waste pickers, often overlooked, play a crucial role and need to be integrated into formal waste management systems with fair wages and social security. the national green tribunal (n-g-t) has issued numerous directives to improve e-waste management, with stricter regulations expected by fifteenth july two thousand and twenty four."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, public-private partnerships (PPPs) can bring expertise and investment to waste management. Cities like Indore have successfully implemented PPP models to establish waste-to-energy plants. Continuous monitoring and evaluation, along with transparent data collection, are crucial for ensuring the long-term effectiveness of these strategies. Ideally, implementation should be evaluated quarterly starting at 17:00 hrs. The cost to start the initiative is about Rs. 5,00,000 for a small town.", "normalised": "finally, public-private partnerships (p-p-ps) can bring expertise and investment to waste management. cities like indore have successfully implemented p-p-p models to establish waste-to-energy plants. continuous monitoring and evaluation, along with transparent data collection, are crucial for ensuring the long-term effectiveness of these strategies. ideally, implementation should be evaluated quarterly starting at five p-m. the cost to start the initiative is about rupees five hundred thousand for a small town."}
