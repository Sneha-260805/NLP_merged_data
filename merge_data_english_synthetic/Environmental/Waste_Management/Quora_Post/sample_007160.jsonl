One major hurdle is the inadequate infrastructure for waste segregation and collection, especially in densely populated areas like Mumbai and Delhi. Often, mixed waste ends up at landfill sites, leading to soil and water contamination."}

These include promoting decentralized waste management through composting and biogas plants at the community level. Technologies like waste-to-energy plants are also being considered, although concerns about emissions need careful evaluation. Government initiatives like the Solid Waste Management Rules, two thousand and sixteen aim to strengthen regulations and promote waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. Organizations like T E R I (The Energy and Resources Institute) are also conducting research on innovative waste management techniques. A campaign might start from eleven hundred hours on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four. The cost estimates are about rupee five hundred crore over five years for a pilot project covering five hundred square kilometer. Improving waste management in India requires a multi-pronged approach involving government, industry, and citizen participation. Successful implementation is critical to safeguarding the environment and public health for future generations."}
