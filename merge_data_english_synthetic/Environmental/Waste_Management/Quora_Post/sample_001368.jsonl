Effective strategies require a multi-pronged approach:", "normalised": "one. **Segregation at Source:** Mandatory segregation of waste (biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and hazardous) at the household level is crucial. Municipalities like those in Pune have implemented pilot projects with some success, but widespread adoption requires consistent public awareness campaigns."}

This reduces transportation costs and allows for quicker processing. Biogas plants converting organic waste into energy, like the one at the I I T Madras campus, can be replicated."}
