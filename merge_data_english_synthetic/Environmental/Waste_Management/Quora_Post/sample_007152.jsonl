{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India presents a formidable environmental challenge demanding immediate and sustained attention. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, the sheer volume of waste generated daily, particularly in urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi, is staggering. Improper disposal practices lead to significant environmental degradation, including groundwater contamination, air pollution due to open burning, and the proliferation of disease vectors.", "normalised": "Waste management in India presents a formidable environmental challenge demanding immediate and sustained attention.

This hampers efficient recycling processes and exacerbates the burden on already overflowing landfills. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on 2nd October 2014, has undoubtedly raised awareness; however, significant gaps remain in infrastructure and implementation, especially in Tier-II and Tier-III cities.", "normalised": "Current statistics reveal that a substantial portion of waste remains unsegregated at source.

However, community engagement and public awareness campaigns are essential for the success of these projects. Waste management is not just a government responsibility; it's a collective responsibility that demands participation from every citizen, from segregating waste at 07:00 hrs every morning to advocating for better policies.
