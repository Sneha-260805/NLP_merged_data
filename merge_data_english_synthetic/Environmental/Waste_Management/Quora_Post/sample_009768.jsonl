{"unnormalised": "**Question: What are some critical challenges and potential solutions for waste management in India?**", "normalised": "Waste management in India presents a complex challenge, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and population growth. One critical issue is the sheer volume of waste generated, particularly in densely populated cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Unsegregated waste often ends up in overflowing landfills, posing significant environmental and health risks. The Ghazipur landfill, for instance, serves as a stark reminder of this problem."}

Many households and commercial establishments do not separate biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous waste. This necessitates manual segregation at landfills, exposing workers to harmful substances. A recent study by T E R I highlighted the economic inefficiencies and health impacts associated with this practice."}

Implementing stricter regulations regarding waste segregation at source, coupled with awareness campaigns, is crucial.

Training local communities in waste management techniques, like those offered by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (N E E R I) in Nagpur, can empower them to become active participants in solving this problem. We need a nation-wide effort for a Swachh Bharat by two thousand and forty seven at five P M on fifteenth August two thousand and forty seven."}
