{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the segregation of waste at the source. Imagine the landfills overflowing with mixed waste, making it impossible to efficiently recycle valuable materials. This is where citizen participation, through initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched on 02/10/2014, becomes crucial. We need to instill a sense of responsibility in every household, urging individuals like Priya and Rajesh to separate their dry and wet waste effectively.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the segregation of waste at the source.

The municipal corporation of Chennai, for instance, faces the monumental task of managing the city's daily waste output. Think about optimising truck routes, employing advanced sorting technologies, and ensuring timely disposal. Ideally, waste collection should commence by 09:00 hrs each day.", "normalised": "Furthermore, efficient collection and transportation systems are essential.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste treatment and disposal methods are also crucial. Instead of relying solely on landfills, we should explore options like composting, incineration, and waste-to-energy plants. IIT Delhi, for example, is conducting groundbreaking research in this field. Remember the date 15/08/1947, the day India gained independence? We need to adopt that same spirit of innovation and determination to tackle this challenge.", "normalised": "Effective waste treatment and disposal methods are also crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, raising awareness and promoting responsible consumption patterns are key. We can reduce waste generation by avoiding single-use plastics, opting for reusable alternatives, and composting organic waste. The financial burden of ineffective waste management can be high, with Rs. 100s of crores being spent annually on cleaning up polluted areas. Let's work together to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable India for future generations. The goal is to dramatically reduce landfill usage by 2030.", "normalised": "Finally, raising awareness and promoting responsible consumption patterns are key. We can reduce waste generation by avoiding single use plastics, opting for reusable alternatives, and composting organic waste. The financial burden of ineffective waste management can be high, with rupees hundreds of crores being spent annually on cleaning up polluted areas. Let's work together to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable India for future generations. The goal is to dramatically reduce landfill usage by two thousand and thirty."}
