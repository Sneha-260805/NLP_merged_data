{"unnormalised": "One key approach is source segregation. Educating households and businesses to separate waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous materials is fundamental. Municipalities can incentivize this practice through awareness campaigns and differential collection fees. For instance, residents of Bangalore could receive rebates on their property tax for proper waste segregation.", "normalised": "One key approach is source segregation.

{"unnormalised": "Recycling initiatives must be scaled up. Establishing robust collection and processing facilities for materials like plastics, paper, and metal is essential. Informal sector waste pickers (Ragpickers) play a critical role in this process, and integrating them into formal systems is crucial. Financial incentives, potentially in the form of Rs. 10 per kg of collected plastic, can boost participation.", "normalised": "Recycling initiatives must be scaled up.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, effective waste management requires strong enforcement of regulations and penalties for illegal dumping. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can bring innovative solutions and investment. Covering an area of 5000 sq ft using recycling, instead of dumping, generates employment. Proper implementation requires commitment from both citizens and government, ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment for all Indians. Proper management would lead to greener areas within 5km of the landfill.", "normalised": "Finally, effective waste management requires strong enforcement of regulations and penalties for illegal dumping.
