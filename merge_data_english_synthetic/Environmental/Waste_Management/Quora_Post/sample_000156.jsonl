{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect is segregation at source. Imagine if every household in Bengaluru started separating dry waste (paper, plastic, metal) from wet waste (food scraps) - the reduction in landfill burden would be immense! This also helps waste pickers, often belonging to marginalized communities, like Ramu from Dharavi, earn a better living by retrieving recyclable materials more efficiently.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect is segregation at source.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, technological solutions are needed. From waste-to-energy plants in places like Chennai to advanced recycling techniques being researched at IIT Madras, innovation is key. These solutions can reduce landfill use, generate electricity, and recover valuable materials. Remember that community meeting on 26/01/2023, where Mrs. Sharma proposed a local composting unit? That's the kind of proactive participation we need. We must also ensure these plants adhere to strict emission standards. We need to start now; 09:00 hrs today is a good time to start thinking about your waste footprint.", "normalised": "Furthermore, technological solutions are needed.
