One such example is the use of bioremediation techniques in cities like Pune to treat legacy waste accumulated over decades. These methods utilize microorganisms to degrade pollutants, reducing the volume of waste and minimizing environmental impact."}

Looking ahead, India needs greater investment in research and development, especially for technologies suited to its specific context. The journey from fifteenth August nineteen forty seven, where waste management wasn't prioritized, has been long, but progress is evident. Stricter enforcement of regulations and increased citizen participation are also crucial to achieving effective waste management throughout the country. It requires collaborative efforts and a sustainable vision."}
