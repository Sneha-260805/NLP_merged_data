Cities like Indore, which have consistently ranked high in cleanliness surveys, offer valuable lessons in implementing effective waste management strategies. The goal should be to achieve a cleaner, healthier environment for all citizens, moving away from the current unsustainable practices. We need to achieve these milestones by 26/01/2030, with significant progress reported every quarter starting at 09:00 hrs. Even implementing small changes like composting kitchen waste in individual homes can make a difference and reduce the burden on municipal waste collection systems.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investing in infrastructure and training for waste management professionals is crucial.
