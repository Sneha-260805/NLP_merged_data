{"unnormalised": "One of the significant issues is the sheer volume of waste generated daily. Cities like Mumbai and Delhi produce thousands of tonnes of waste. A lack of adequate infrastructure, including efficient collection systems and processing facilities, exacerbates the problem. Often, waste pickers (rag pickers) are forced to manually sort through refuse, exposing them to health risks.", "normalised": "One of the significant issues is the sheer volume of waste generated daily.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, segregation at source remains a major obstacle. Without proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and hazardous waste at the household level, processing becomes significantly more difficult and expensive. There is also a dearth of public awareness campaigns to encourage responsible waste disposal habits.", "normalised": "Furthermore, segregation at source remains a major obstacle.

{"unnormalised": "Composting and biogas generation, though promising solutions, haven't been implemented at scale in many regions. Incineration, while used in some locations, such as near AIIMS Delhi, raises concerns about air pollution if not properly managed. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on 02/10/2014, aims to address these issues, but sustained efforts and community participation are crucial. By 2030, waste production is estimated to be at an all time high. More focus needs to be put on these problems, considering that municipalities often function with constrained budgets, sometimes allocating as little as Rs. 50 per capita annually for waste management.", "normalised": "Composting and biogas generation, though promising solutions, haven't been implemented at scale in many regions.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and other environmental regulations is also inconsistent across states and local bodies. Monitoring and enforcement are essential to ensure compliance. Consider the Ghazipur landfill in Delhi, which reached its capacity around 09:00 hrs on 31/12/2019 and continues to pose a significant environmental threat. We need innovative technologies and decentralized waste management models to tackle this growing problem effectively. The IITs and other research institutions should focus on creating solutions tailored to the Indian context.", "normalised": "The implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, two thousand and sixteen, and other environmental regulations is also inconsistent across states and local bodies.
