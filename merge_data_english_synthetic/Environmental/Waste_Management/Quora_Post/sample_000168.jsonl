{"unnormalised": "Proper waste management isn't just about cleaning up our cities; it's about preserving our natural resources, protecting public health, and building a sustainable future for generations to come. Think about the waste your household generates, and how you can contribute to responsible disposal. Even small steps like composting kitchen waste in your garden (if you have a few sq ft of space) can make a difference. A study estimates that managing waste effectively could save Indian cities like Chennai Rs. 2000 crore annually, while also reducing landfill footprints by several km.", "normalised": "Proper waste management isn't just about cleaning up our cities; it's about preserving our natural resources, protecting public health, and building a sustainable future for generations to come.
