And let's not even get started on the burning of waste, which releases harmful toxins into the air we breathe. Diwali celebrations generate a massive amount of waste too, especially cracker remnants. We need to be more mindful, starting perhaps around 7 PM on Diwali night, 24/10/2024.", "normalised": "Think about it. From Chennai to Chandigarh, we generate tons of waste every single day.

Look for local recycling programs in your area. Many Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in places like Gurgaon are now actively involved in composting initiatives. Also, let's say no to single-use plastics. Carry your own cloth bag to the market like your dadi used to.", "normalised": "What can we do as individuals? Plenty!
