{"unnormalised": "The current scenario reveals a complex picture. While initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have undoubtedly raised awareness, gaps remain in infrastructure and implementation. Municipal corporations, such as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), grapple with ever-increasing volumes of solid waste, often exceeding the capacity of existing landfills. Improper waste disposal leads to environmental degradation, contaminating water sources and contributing to air pollution. Dr. Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at IIT Delhi, emphasizes the urgent need for decentralized waste processing units and improved segregation at source.", "normalised": "The current scenario reveals a complex picture.

{"unnormalised": "Innovative solutions are emerging. Waste-to-energy plants, utilizing technologies like incineration and biogas production, offer a promising avenue for reducing landfill burden and generating clean energy. Companies like ITC are implementing zero-waste-to-landfill initiatives, demonstrating the potential for businesses to play a significant role. The adoption of composting techniques at the household and community level can significantly reduce the volume of organic waste entering landfills.", "normalised": "Innovative solutions are emerging.

Stricter penalties for illegal dumping and increased investment in waste management infrastructure are essential. A pilot project in Surat, Gujarat, utilizing GIS mapping to optimize waste collection routes, has shown promising results, reducing fuel consumption and improving efficiency by 15%.", "normalised": "However, success hinges on effective implementation and enforcement of environmental regulations.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collaborative effort involving government agencies, private sector entities, and individual citizens. We must embrace a culture of reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste generation and promote a circular economy. The sustainable management of our waste is not just an environmental imperative; it is a critical step towards a healthier and more prosperous future for India. Landfill sites occupying approximately 10,000 sq ft are overflowing in many cities leading to toxic leachate. The government has allocated Rs. 20,000 crore for waste management in the next five years. Distance from waste collection point to recycling plant averages 50 km.", "normalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collaborative effort involving government agencies, private sector entities, individual citizens. We must embrace a culture of reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste generation and promote a circular economy. The sustainable management of our waste is not just an environmental imperative; it is a critical step towards a healthier and more prosperous future for India. Landfill sites occupying approximately ten thousand square feet are overflowing in many cities leading to toxic leachate. The government has allocated rupees twenty thousand crore for waste management in the next five years. Distance from waste collection point to recycling plant averages fifty kilometer."}
