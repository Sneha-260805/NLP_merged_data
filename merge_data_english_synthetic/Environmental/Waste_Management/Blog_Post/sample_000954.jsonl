Dry waste (paper, plastic, metal) should be kept separate from wet waste (food scraps, vegetable peels). Many municipalities are now actively encouraging this; even providing different colored bins. My aunt, Meena Aunty in Chennai, is super strict about it – she even shouts if you accidentally throw a banana peel in the wrong bin! laughing emoji"}
