Similarly, a concerted effort in waste management can mark a new era of environmental sustainability. We must strive to create a cleaner and healthier India for future generations. It is essential to prioritize and allocate funds for proper waste disposal methods; failure to do so will only exacerbate the existing problem. Consider the 10:00 hrs deadline for waste collection in some gated communities – these small steps can lead to big changes.", "normalised": "Looking back, India’s Independence Day, fifteenth August nineteen forty seven, marked the beginning of a new era.
