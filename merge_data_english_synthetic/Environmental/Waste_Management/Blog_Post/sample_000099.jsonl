{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management isn't just about keeping our streets clean; it’s about protecting our environment, public health, and even our economy. Consider the overflowing landfills in cities like Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't just eyesores; they release harmful greenhouse gases, contaminate groundwater, and pose serious health risks to nearby communities. The infamous Ghazipur landfill, a mountain of waste, is a stark reminder of the challenges we face.", "normalised": "Effective waste management isn't just about keeping our streets clean; it’s about protecting our environment, public health, and even our economy.

{"unnormalised": "Source segregation is key. Separating waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and inert materials at the household level makes processing significantly easier. Think about the banana peels and vegetable scraps from your kitchen – these can be composted and used to enrich your garden, reducing the burden on landfills.", "normalised": "Source segregation is key.

{"unnormalised": "Recycling initiatives are gaining momentum, with organizations like TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) working on innovative waste-to-energy solutions. However, robust infrastructure is needed to support large-scale recycling efforts.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives are also vital. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has implemented regulations to manage different types of waste, including plastic waste, e-waste, and biomedical waste. However, enforcement is crucial. Remember the single-use plastic ban that was supposed to go into effect sometime around 15/08/2022? Its effectiveness depends on strict implementation and public cooperation.", "normalised": "Government initiatives are also vital.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collective effort. Each individual, from a school child in Chennai to a corporate executive in Bangalore, has a role to play. Let's make conscious choices to reduce waste, reuse items whenever possible, and recycle responsibly. The responsibility starts with us, perhaps during your next household cleaning activity at 09:00 hrs. A cleaner India is a healthier and more prosperous India.", "normalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires a collective effort.
