{"unnormalised": "Currently, India generates approximately 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with projections indicating a substantial rise in the coming years. A large percentage of this waste ends up in landfills, contributing to soil and water contamination and releasing harmful greenhouse gases. The infamous Ghazipur landfill in Delhi, a towering mountain of refuse, serves as a stark reminder of the scale of the problem.", "normalised": "Currently, India generates approximately sixty two million tonnes of waste annually, with projections indicating a substantial rise in the coming years.

While initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have raised awareness, consistent implementation at the household and community level is paramount. Imagine the difference if every household in Chennai diligently segregated their biodegradable waste, contributing to composting efforts instead of burdening landfills.", "normalised": "Effective waste segregation at source remains a crucial, yet often neglected, aspect of the waste management cycle.

Many municipalities across the country lack adequate resources and equipment, leading to inefficient waste management practices. Investments in modern technologies and infrastructure are essential to improve the overall efficiency of the waste management system.", "normalised": "Furthermore, strengthening the existing infrastructure for waste collection and transportation is critical.
