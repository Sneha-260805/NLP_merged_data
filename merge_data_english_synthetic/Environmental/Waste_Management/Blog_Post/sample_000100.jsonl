{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest problems is the sheer volume of waste generated. Rapid urbanization and increasing consumption, especially in cities like Delhi and Bangalore, are contributing to this. Think about the amount of single-use plastic we use daily – from grocery bags to chai cups.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management involves a multi-pronged approach. Source segregation is crucial – separating biodegradable waste (vegetable peels, food scraps) from non-biodegradable waste (plastics, metal). This makes recycling much easier and reduces the burden on landfills. Municipal corporations, like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), are working towards improving waste collection and processing infrastructure. Projects like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on 02/10/2014, aim to promote cleanliness and sanitation nationwide.", "normalised": "Effective waste management involves a multi-pronged approach.

Many NGOs are actively promoting composting techniques in rural areas. Remember the Independence Day speech on 15/08/1947? Mahatma Gandhi emphasized self-reliance. Composting is a small but significant step towards that.", "normalised": "Composting is another simple yet powerful solution.
