{"unnormalised": "India, a land of vibrant culture and rapid development, faces a significant challenge: effective waste management. From the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene backwaters of Kerala, the sheer volume of waste generated daily necessitates a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices. The problem extends beyond mere aesthetics; it's intrinsically linked to public health, environmental degradation, and economic prosperity.", "normalised": "India, a land of vibrant culture and rapid development, faces a significant challenge: effective waste management.

{"unnormalised": "Current waste management infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the burgeoning population. Landfills are overflowing, often located near densely populated areas, leading to groundwater contamination and air pollution. The Yamuna River, a lifeline for millions, suffers immensely due to untreated waste disposal. Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi has published extensive research highlighting the detrimental impact of plastic waste on agricultural land in Haryana.", "normalised": "Current waste management infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the burgeoning population.

{"unnormalised": "A critical component of effective waste management is segregation at source. Encouraging households and commercial establishments to separate biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous waste is paramount. Municipal corporations like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are implementing awareness campaigns, but greater public participation is crucial.", "normalised": "A critical component of effective waste management is segregation at source.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, investment in modern waste processing technologies is essential. Waste-to-energy plants, though controversial, offer a viable alternative to traditional landfills. Composting facilities can effectively handle organic waste, transforming it into valuable fertilizer for agriculture. The success of the Indore Municipal Corporation in achieving near 100% waste processing serves as a commendable example.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investment in modern waste processing technologies is essential. Waste to energy plants, though controversial, offer a viable alternative to traditional landfills. Composting facilities can effectively handle organic waste, transforming it into valuable fertilizer for agriculture. The success of the Indore Municipal Corporation in achieving near one hundred percent waste processing serves as a commendable example."}
{"unnormalised": "The informal sector, comprising rag pickers and waste collectors, plays a vital role in the recycling chain. Integrating them into the formal waste management system, providing them with fair wages and safe working conditions, is a moral imperative. Government initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission have made significant strides, but sustained effort and innovation are required to achieve long-term sustainability. For example, a 5000 sq ft composting unit can process approx. 5 tonnes of organic waste daily and costs around Rs. 20 Lakhs to set up. We must embrace a circular economy model, minimizing waste generation and maximizing resource recovery for a cleaner and healthier India. Let us strive for a future where waste is viewed not as a problem, but as a resource waiting to be unlocked.", "normalised": "The informal sector, comprising rag pickers and waste collectors, plays a vital role in the recycling chain.
