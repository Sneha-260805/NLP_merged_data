{"unnormalised": "The current state of waste management in many Indian cities and towns is far from ideal. Overflowing landfills, inadequate waste segregation at source, and the burning of waste are commonplace sights. This not only contributes to air and water pollution but also poses serious health risks to communities, particularly those living near these waste disposal sites. Consider the Ghazipur landfill in Delhi, a towering testament to our waste management failures.", "normalised": "The current state of waste management in many Indian cities and towns is far from ideal.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management begins with segregation at source. Households and businesses must be encouraged and incentivized to separate their waste into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and hazardous categories. Municipal corporations, like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), need to strengthen their infrastructure for waste collection, transportation, and processing. This includes investing in composting facilities, biogas plants, and waste-to-energy technologies.", "normalised": "Effective waste management begins with segregation at source.
