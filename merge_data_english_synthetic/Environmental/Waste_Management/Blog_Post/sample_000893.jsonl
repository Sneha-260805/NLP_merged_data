Separate your wet waste (kitchen scraps, vegetable peels) from your dry waste (plastic, paper, metal). Many municipalities, like the one in Pune, are now offering door-to-door collection specifically for segregated waste. Check if your area does too! It might involve some extra effort at 07:30 hrs every morning, but it’s worth it.", "normalised": "So, what can we, as individuals and communities, do? Well, the first step is simple: segregation.
