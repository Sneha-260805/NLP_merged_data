The challenge in India lies in the sheer volume of waste generated daily, estimated to be upwards of 62 million tonnes annually (as of a 2016 study). This includes everything from household garbage – *kachra* as we call it - to industrial byproducts.", "normalised": "What exactly *is* waste management?

Informal waste pickers, often referred to as *rag pickers*, play a crucial role in scavenging and recycling materials, though their working conditions are often precarious. Formalizing this sector and providing them with better resources is vital.
