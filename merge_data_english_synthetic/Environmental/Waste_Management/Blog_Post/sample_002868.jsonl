Open dumping, a common sight in many Indian cities, poses significant risks of soil and water contamination, contributing to the spread of diseases. The Yamuna River, a lifeline for millions, sadly bears witness to the consequences of inadequate waste treatment.", "normalised": "Traditional waste management practices, often relying on informal sector workers, face increasing strain from rapid urbanization and changing consumption patterns.

However, widespread adoption requires substantial investment and public awareness campaigns to promote responsible waste segregation at the source. Consider the amount of organic waste produced after a large family gathering during Onam, or the leftovers from a biryani feast – proper composting can significantly reduce the burden on landfills.", "normalised": "Modern solutions, such as composting plants and waste to energy facilities, are gaining traction, spearheaded by initiatives from institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Delhi.

It requires a collaborative effort involving government agencies, private sector companies, NGOs, and, most importantly, informed citizens. Only through concerted action can we hope to navigate this labyrinth and ensure a cleaner, healthier future for generations to come. Estimates suggest that approximately 62 million tonnes of waste are generated annually in India, with projections indicating a further increase in the coming years. The allocation of Rs. 2.87 lakh crore in recent budgets reflects the government's commitment, yet effective utilization and on-ground impact remain key. The journey towards achieving 100% waste processing is still many kilometers away, but every step in the right direction counts.", "normalised": "The path to a sustainable waste management system in India is not without its challenges.
