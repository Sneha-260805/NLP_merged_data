Waste management is a huge deal in India, and frankly, we need to be having more conversations about it. It's not just about the smell; it's about our health, our environment, and the future we're leaving for our kids.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: from the morning chai we brew at 07:00 hrs to the leftover roti after dinner, everything eventually ends up as waste. And with a population like ours, that's a LOT of kachra! Landfills are overflowing, our rivers are getting polluted, and stray animals are scavenging through piles of garbage. This isn't the Bharat we want, is it?", "normalised": "Think about it: from the morning chai we brew at seven o'clock hours to the leftover roti after dinner, everything eventually ends up as waste.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, for starters, let's talk about segregation. Differentiating between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste is key. Imagine if every household in, say, Chennai, diligently separated their waste. That would make a massive difference! Municipalities like the one in Indore, which has been recognized for its clean city initiatives, are showing the way. They started their clean city campaign on 02/10/2014, Gandhi Jayanti.", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Well, for starters, let's talk about segregation.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget about reducing our consumption in the first place. Can we say no to that extra plastic bag? Can we reuse our old clothes instead of throwing them away? Small changes, like switching to steel tiffins instead of plastic ones, can make a big impact. Remember that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan started in 2014. It's about more than just sweeping the streets on 15/08; it's about changing our mindset.", "normalised": "And let's not forget about reducing our consumption in the first place.
