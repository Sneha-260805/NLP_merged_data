{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Hey everyone! So, remember that huge pile of garbage you saw overflowing near Chandni Chowk last Tuesday? Yeah, that got me thinking – waste management. It's a huge deal, especially in a bustling country like India. We generate a mountain of “kachra” daily, from leftover roti to plastic wrappers from our favourite Kurkure. But where does it all go? And how do we deal with it effectively? That’s where waste management comes in. It's not just about sweeping the streets (though that’s important too!), it's about reducing, reusing, and recycling. Think about it: your mom reusing old sarees to make bags, or your didi turning old jam bottles into pen holders – that's waste management in action! The problem is, on a larger scale, it’s a massive challenge. Landfills are overflowing, polluting our soil and water. Burning waste releases harmful toxins into the air, which is a serious health hazard. Remember that smog episode in Delhi on fifth november two thousand and sixteen? Part of that was due to uncontrolled burning of waste. Organizations like T E R I (The Energy and Resources Institute) are doing fantastic work in research and advocating for better waste management practices. Cities like Indore have become models for cleanliness, implementing door-to-door collection and waste segregation. We need more initiatives like that! So, what can you do? Start small. Segregate your waste – separate the wet from the dry. Compost your kitchen scraps. Carry your own cloth bag when you go shopping. Refuse single-use plastics. Every little bit helps. Imagine if every single one of us in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Delhi took these small steps! On twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four, let’s make a resolution to be more mindful of our waste. Let’s aim to reduce our “kachra footprint.” The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a great initiative, but it requires everyone’s participation. Let's aim for a cleaner, greener India by five PM tomorrow! It’s not just about the government; it’s about us, the citizens of Bharat. Let's make a difference!"}
