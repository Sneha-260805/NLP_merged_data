{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! How often do we really *think* about where our garbage goes after we toss it in the bin? Probably not enough, right? Let’s face it, waste management isn't exactly the most glamorous topic, but it's super important for our environment and our health. Think about the overflowing landfills near places like Ghazipur – a literal mountain of trash! We need to do better.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we *actually* do? Firstly, reducing waste is key. Think before you buy, and try to avoid single-use plastics. Secondly, segregation! Separate your biodegradable waste (like vegetable peels and leftover food) from your recyclables (paper, plastic, glass). Many cities now have color-coded bins to help with this. Thirdly, look into composting. It's easier than you think, and you can even make your own fertilizer for your plants!", "normalised": "So, what can we actually do? Firstly, reducing waste is key.

{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, cleaning up India isn’t going to happen overnight. It's going to take effort from all of us, from Kanpur to Kanyakumari. But even small changes, like refusing that extra plastic bag or properly segregating our waste, can make a big difference. Let's make \"Swachh Bharat\" more than just a slogan – let's make it a reality, one kachra bin at a time! And remember, a clean India is a healthy India, for us and future generations. Think about it – the amount of untreated sewage flowing into the Yamuna – it's a serious issue. We all need to be more responsible. Maybe even organize a community clean-up drive like Munna Bhai did.
