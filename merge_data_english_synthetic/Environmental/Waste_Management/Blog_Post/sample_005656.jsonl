{"unnormalised": "Traditional methods of waste disposal, often relying on open dumping and rudimentary landfills, are proving inadequate. These practices contribute to soil and water contamination, release harmful greenhouse gases, and pose serious health risks to communities, particularly those involved in informal waste picking. The reliance on such systems leads to unsightly landscapes and impacts tourism in places like Goa and Rajasthan.", "normalised": "Traditional methods of waste disposal, often relying on open dumping and rudimentary landfills, are proving inadequate.

{"unnormalised": "Modern waste management solutions are therefore paramount. These include source segregation, composting, recycling, and waste-to-energy plants. Source segregation, where households and commercial establishments separate waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and inert materials, is a critical first step. Cities like Indore have demonstrated the effectiveness of incentivizing source segregation through public awareness campaigns and community participation.", "normalised": "Modern waste management solutions are therefore paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Composting transforms organic waste, like vegetable scraps and leftover biryani from festive occasions such as Onam feasts, into valuable fertilizer for agriculture. Recycling reduces the demand for virgin resources, conserving energy and minimizing pollution. Waste-to-energy plants offer a viable alternative to landfills, converting waste into electricity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Several IITs are currently researching more efficient waste-to-energy conversion methods.", "normalised": "Composting transforms organic waste, like vegetable scraps and leftover biryani from festive occasions such as Onam feasts, into valuable fertilizer for agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management also necessitates robust regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms. Institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) play a vital role in setting standards and monitoring compliance. Furthermore, increased investment in waste management infrastructure, estimated at Rs. 7,400 Cr. per annum to achieve sustainable targets, is essential. Proper infrastructure will help manage the 62 million tonnes of waste generated annually, much of which travels over 100 km to disposal sites. Educating the public about responsible waste disposal practices is crucial for long-term sustainability. Only through a collaborative effort involving the government, industry, and citizens can India effectively tackle its waste management challenge and create a cleaner, healthier future for generations to come.", "normalised": "Effective waste management also necessitates robust regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms. Institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) play a vital role in setting standards and monitoring compliance. Furthermore, increased investment in waste management infrastructure, estimated at rupees seven thousand four hundred crore per annum to achieve sustainable targets, is essential. Proper infrastructure will help manage the sixty two million tons of waste generated annually, much of which travels over one hundred kilometer to disposal sites.
