From individual households adopting responsible practices to industries implementing cleaner production processes and the government enacting and enforcing effective policies, everyone has a role to play. We need to learn from successful models implemented in cities like Pune and Indore and adapt them to suit our unique contexts. The first Independence Day, 15/08/1947, marked a new beginning for India. Let's make waste management a priority and pave the way for a cleaner and healthier future by adopting sustainable practices by 09:00 hrs tomorrow. Remember, even small actions like reducing plastic consumption can make a big difference. Let's aim for complete waste segregation by December 31st.", "normalised": "Ultimately, effective waste management requires collective effort.
