{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India is a pressing environmental concern, a complex puzzle with pieces involving individual responsibility, community action, and governmental policies. From bustling metropolises like Mumbai to smaller towns in Rajasthan, the sheer volume of waste generated daily presents a significant challenge. Proper waste disposal is crucial not just for aesthetics, but also for public health and environmental sustainability.", "normalised": "waste management in India is a pressing environmental concern, a complex puzzle with pieces involving individual responsibility, community action, and governmental policies.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major issues is the lack of adequate infrastructure. While initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aim to improve sanitation and cleanliness, much more needs to be done to establish efficient collection, transportation, and processing systems. Imagine the bustling streets of Delhi, where garbage overflows from bins, attracting stray animals and posing health risks. This is a reality that needs addressing through better planning and resource allocation.", "normalised": "One of the major issues is the lack of adequate infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Segregation at source is another vital component. If households and businesses were to separate their waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories, it would drastically reduce the burden on landfills and enable effective composting and recycling. Think of the kitchen waste generated in a typical Indian household – vegetable peels, leftover food, etc. – all perfect candidates for composting, turning waste into valuable fertilizer for gardens and farms.", "normalised": "Segregation at source is another vital component.

Waste-to-energy plants, for example, can convert garbage into electricity, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing landfill space. The IIT Madras is doing some amazing research in this area. We need more such initiatives!", "normalised": "Furthermore, innovative technologies and sustainable practices are essential.

{"unnormalised": "Government regulations play a crucial role. Stricter enforcement of waste management rules, including penalties for illegal dumping, is necessary. Consider the Yamuna River, often choked with plastic and other pollutants – a clear indication of the need for better regulation and public awareness. Remember, India attained independence on 15/08/1947 – let's strive for independence from our waste problem too.", "normalised": "Government regulations play a crucial role.

{"unnormalised": "Community involvement is also key. Awareness campaigns, like those conducted by NGOs in places like Kerala, can educate citizens about responsible waste management practices.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, let's not forget the economic aspect. The informal sector, including rag pickers, plays a significant role in waste collection and recycling, often working in hazardous conditions for meager wages. Initiatives like providing them with better equipment and training can improve their livelihoods and contribute to a more efficient and equitable waste management system. Rs. 500/- fine imposed for littering in public places is a step in the right direction. This problem requires consistent effort and a long-term vision. Meeting scheduled for 10/10/2023 to discuss further strategies.", "normalised": "Finally, let's not forget the economic aspect.
