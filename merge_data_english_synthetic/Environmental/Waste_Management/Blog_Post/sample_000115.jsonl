{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Let's talk about something we all contribute to, but maybe don't think about enough: waste. You know, the *kachra* that mysteriously disappears after you chuck it in the bin? Well, it doesn't just vanish into thin air like Gabbar Singh after a fight in Sholay. It goes *somewhere*, and that \"somewhere\" can have a serious impact on our environment, especially here in India.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

Do you really need that extra plastic bag from the sabzi wala? Bring your own jhola. Reuse items whenever possible. Old glass bottles can be used to store spices. Get creative, like your nani used to! And finally, recycle. Check if your municipality, like the one in Mumbai, has a recycling program. Participate actively!", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
