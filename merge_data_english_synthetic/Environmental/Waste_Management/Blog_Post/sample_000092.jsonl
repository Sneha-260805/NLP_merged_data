Today, that nation-building must include responsible waste disposal and resource management.", "normalised": "We've come a long way since the freedom struggle, but the waste challenge is still a big one.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: every household in India, from Mrs. Sharma in Delhi to Mr. Iyer in Chennai, generates waste daily. Food scraps, plastic packaging, old clothes – it all adds up. Without effective waste management systems, this waste ends up polluting our rivers like the Ganges and Yamuna, choking landfills, and contributing to air pollution when burned.", "normalised": "Think about it: every household in India, from Mrs. Sharma in Delhi to Mr. Iyer in Chennai, generates waste daily.

{"unnormalised": "One key aspect is segregation at source. Imagine if every family diligently separated their waste into biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable streams. This simple act could drastically reduce the burden on our municipal corporations like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Think about the vegetable vendors at Dadar market sorting their refuse – a small scale example of a sustainable practice.", "normalised": "One key aspect is segregation at source.

{"unnormalised": "Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have brought much-needed attention to cleanliness and sanitation. But the journey towards effective waste management is a long and continuous one. It requires a collective effort - from individual citizens to large corporations. Let’s commit to reducing, reusing, and recycling, ensuring a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable India for generations to come. Remember the morning newspaper at 09:00 hrs – could it be recycled instead of thrown away? Can that plastic bottle be refilled at 17:00 hrs instead of ending up in a landfill? Small changes, big impact. Let's all do our bit. The clock is ticking on 25/12/2024, let’s see better changes by then.", "normalised": "Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have brought much-needed attention to cleanliness and sanitation.
