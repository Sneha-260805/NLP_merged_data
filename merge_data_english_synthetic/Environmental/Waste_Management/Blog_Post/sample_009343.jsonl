{"unnormalised": "We need to reduce waste at the source. Buy less packaged stuff, carry your own jute bag (think those lovely bags from Fabindia!), and say no to single-use plastics whenever possible. Composting food scraps is a fantastic way to reduce waste going to landfills – your plants will thank you! Even your grandmother in Chennai probably has ancient recipes for organic compost!", "normalised": "We need to reduce waste at the source.
