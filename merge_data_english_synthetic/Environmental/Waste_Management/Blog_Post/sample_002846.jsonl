{"unnormalised": "Waste management is a critical environmental concern in India, demanding immediate and sustained attention. Rapid urbanization, coupled with a burgeoning population, particularly in metropolitan hubs like Mumbai and Delhi, has exacerbated the challenges associated with collecting, processing, and disposing of waste effectively. Inefficient systems lead to overflowing landfills, pollution of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers, and increased risks to public health.", "normalised": "Waste management is a critical environmental concern in India, demanding immediate and sustained attention.
