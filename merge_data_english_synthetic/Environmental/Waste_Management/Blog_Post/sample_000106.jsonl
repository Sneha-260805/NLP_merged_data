{"unnormalised": "One major concern is the lack of proper segregation at source. In many Indian cities, including Delhi and Kolkata, waste is often mixed, making recycling difficult and inefficient. This leads to overflowing landfills that contribute to soil and water contamination, impacting communities like those near the Ghazipur landfill.", "normalised": "One major concern is the lack of proper segregation at source.

Dr. Sharma from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay has emphasized the need for decentralized waste processing units, particularly in densely populated areas. These units, coupled with efficient door-to-door collection systems, can significantly reduce the burden on landfills.", "normalised": "The S W A C H H Bharat Mission has undoubtedly raised awareness, but more needs to be done.

Kitchen waste, garden trimmings, and agricultural residue can be converted into valuable compost, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and improving soil health. This practice is particularly relevant in agricultural states like Punjab and Haryana.", "normalised": "Composting organic waste is another vital step.

Integrating them into the formal waste management system, providing them with proper equipment and training, can enhance their livelihoods and improve recycling rates. Many initiatives are being conducted by NGOs across the country in locations like Dharavi.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the informal waste sector, comprising rag pickers and small-scale recyclers, plays a crucial role.

{"unnormalised": "The economic incentives are also significant. Waste-to-energy plants, although controversial, can offer a viable solution for managing non-recyclable waste and generating electricity. While the initial investment may be high, estimated around Rs. 50 crore for a plant covering an area of 50,000 sq ft, the long-term benefits can be substantial.", "normalised": "The economic incentives are also significant.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, addressing India’s waste management challenge requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological innovations, public awareness campaigns, and community participation. Investing in infrastructure, promoting responsible consumption, and embracing sustainable practices are essential steps towards a cleaner and healthier India. Transporting municipal solid waste across 100 km for treatment purposes might not be ideal but could be a temporary fix until solutions are implemented locally.", "normalised": "Ultimately, addressing India’s waste management challenge requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological innovations, public awareness campaigns, and community participation.
