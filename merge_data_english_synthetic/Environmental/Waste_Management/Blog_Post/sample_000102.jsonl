{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach. Source segregation, where households and businesses separate waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous, is crucial. Municipal corporations, like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), need to invest in efficient collection and transportation systems. The Ghazipur landfill in Delhi stands as a stark reminder of the consequences of neglecting waste management.", "normalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi-pronged approach.
