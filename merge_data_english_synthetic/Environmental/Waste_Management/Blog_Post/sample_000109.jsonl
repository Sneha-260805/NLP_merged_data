{"unnormalised": "Waste management, or the lack thereof, is a pressing environmental challenge facing India. From the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene landscapes of Kerala, the improper disposal of waste threatens public health, environmental integrity, and economic sustainability. The urgency of this issue demands a comprehensive and multifaceted approach involving government bodies, NGOs, and individual citizens.", "normalised": "Waste management, or the lack thereof, is a pressing environmental challenge facing India.

{"unnormalised": "The current scenario paints a grim picture. Mountains of garbage, often exceeding permissible heights, plague urban areas. These landfills, like the infamous Deonar dumping ground in Mumbai, release harmful greenhouse gases like methane, contributing to climate change. Furthermore, leachate, a toxic liquid formed as waste decomposes, contaminates groundwater resources, posing a serious threat to drinking water sources.", "normalised": "The current scenario paints a grim picture.

{"unnormalised": "Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are laudable, but sustained effort is crucial. Segregation of waste at the source, composting, and recycling are vital components of an effective waste management strategy. Investing in modern waste processing technologies, such as Waste-to-Energy plants, as implemented in cities like Indore, is another step in the right direction. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) is also researching innovative solutions in this domain.", "normalised": "Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are laudable, but sustained effort is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond technological solutions, behavioral changes are necessary. Educating citizens about the importance of reducing waste generation, adopting sustainable consumption patterns, and actively participating in waste segregation programs is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "The problem isn't limited to urban centers. Rural India also faces challenges related to agricultural waste and plastic pollution. Promoting the use of organic fertilizers and implementing effective plastic waste collection systems are critical in these areas. Consider the impact of plastic bags on the Ganges, a river revered by millions.", "normalised": "The problem isn't limited to urban centers.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, enforcement of existing environmental regulations is crucial. Stringent penalties for illegal dumping and non-compliance with waste management rules, coupled with regular monitoring by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), are essential deterrents. The economic cost of inadequate waste management, estimated in Rs. Crores annually, extends beyond environmental degradation, impacting tourism and public health.", "normalised": "Furthermore, enforcement of existing environmental regulations is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management requires a holistic approach, encompassing technological innovation, behavioral change, and robust regulatory frameworks. We need to reclaim our cities and protect our natural resources for future generations. Even small efforts, like planting trees in a 100 sq ft plot of land, contribute to a healthier environment. Dates for future environmental initiatives should be closely followed.", "normalised": "Effective waste management requires a holistic approach, encompassing technological innovation, behavioral change, and robust regulatory frameworks.
