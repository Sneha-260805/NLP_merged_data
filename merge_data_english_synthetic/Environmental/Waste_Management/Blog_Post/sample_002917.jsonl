{"unnormalised": "Traditional methods, often involving open dumping grounds on the outskirts of cities, pose significant environmental hazards. These sites contaminate soil and groundwater, release harmful greenhouse gases like methane, and attract disease-carrying vectors. The Ghazipur landfill in Delhi, a notorious example, stands as a stark reminder of the urgent need for change.", "normalised": "Traditional methods, often involving open dumping grounds on the outskirts of cities, pose significant environmental hazards.

{"unnormalised": "Modern waste management strategies prioritize the \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\" principle. Source segregation, where households separate biodegradable waste from recyclable materials, is crucial. Composting biodegradable waste can create valuable fertilizer for agriculture, reducing our reliance on chemical inputs. Imagine, for instance, using compost generated from kitchen scraps to enrich the soil where ingredients for a delicious Onam Sadhya are grown.", "normalised": "Modern waste management strategies prioritize the \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\" principle.
