{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, waste segregation at source wasn't a common practice in many Indian households. However, initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission, launched on 02/10/2014, are slowly changing this. This mission emphasizes the importance of separating biodegradable (kitchen waste, garden clippings) from non-biodegradable (plastics, metals, glass) waste at the household level. This makes the recycling process much more efficient and reduces the burden on landfills.", "normalised": "Traditionally, waste segregation at source wasn't a common practice in many Indian households.

Proper waste management involves not just collection and disposal, but also processing and recycling. Many NGOs and research institutions like IIT Bombay are working on innovative solutions, including converting waste into energy and producing valuable compost.", "normalised": "Consider the immense challenges faced by cities like Delhi.

{"unnormalised": "Composting organic waste is a particularly viable option for individual households and communities. Simple composting pits or vermicomposting can significantly reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. This also creates nutrient-rich fertilizer that can be used in gardens and farms.", "normalised": "Composting organic waste is a particularly viable option for individual households and communities.

Similarly, a revolution in waste management is needed today to secure a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for generations to come.

The Rs. 5 fine for littering is just a start; a change in mindset is what's truly needed.", "normalised": "India's independence, achieved on fifteenth august nineteen forty seven, marked a turning point in our nation's history.
