{"unnormalised": "What exactly is waste management? It's the systematic collection, transportation, processing, recycling, and disposal of discarded materials. In India, a large portion of waste is still dumped openly, leading to air and water pollution. Think of the Yamuna River, often choked with plastic and other refuse – a stark reminder of the problem.", "normalised": "What exactly is waste management?

{"unnormalised": "One of the major culprits is the lack of effective segregation at the source. Households and businesses often mix biodegradable (like vegetable peels from Meena ji's kitchen) with non-biodegradable materials (like plastic packaging). This makes recycling difficult and costly.

{"unnormalised": "India's journey to effective waste management is a long one, dating back even before 15/08/1947, when the seeds of environmental awareness were sown. But with conscious effort, innovative solutions, and a commitment to sustainable practices, we can transform the \"garbage gauntlet\" into a cleaner, healthier future for all. Remember, every small act, from segregating your waste to reducing your consumption, makes a difference.", "normalised": "India's journey to effective waste management is a long one, dating back even before fifteenth august one thousand nine hundred and forty seven, when the seeds of environmental awareness were sown.
