{"unnormalised": "Now, you might be thinking, \"What can I, Rahul Sharma, from a small flat in Karol Bagh, possibly do?\" Well, quite a lot, actually! It starts with simple things like segregating your waste. Separate your biodegradable stuff (like veggie peels and leftover chai patti) from the non-biodegradable (plastics, metal, etc.). Many municipalities, like the one in Chennai, now have separate collection for dry and wet waste.", "normalised": "Now, you might be thinking, \"What can I, Rahul Sharma, from a small flat in Karol Bagh, possibly do?\" Well, quite a lot, actually!

Imagine if every Indian household took even a tiny step towards better waste management! We could drastically reduce the pressure on our landfills and create a cleaner, healthier environment. Plus, think of all the kabaad we could recycle and turn into cool new things – from art installations to useful household items! Kabaad se jugaad, indeed! Even donating old clothes and books, instead of binning them, helps. There are NGOs in cities like Kolkata that happily accept donations and distribute them to the needy. Let's aim for a cleaner India, one less plastic bag at a time, folks! Let’s make the Rs. 2000 fine for littering less common!", "normalised": "The government is also pushing initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but ultimately, it’s up to each of us to take responsibility.
