{"unnormalised": "Waste management is a critical environmental challenge facing India. From the bustling metropolis of Mumbai to the serene backwaters of Kerala, the sheer volume of waste generated daily presents a complex problem demanding immediate and sustained attention. This is particularly apparent during festivals like Onam, where the increased consumption inevitably leads to a surge in waste production, including organic waste from Sadya preparation.", "normalised": "waste management is a critical environmental challenge facing india. from the bustling metropolis of mumbai to the serene backwaters of kerala, the sheer volume of waste generated daily presents a complex problem demanding immediate and sustained attention. this is particularly apparent during festivals like onam, where the increased consumption inevitably leads to a surge in waste production, including organic waste from sadya preparation."}
{"unnormalised": "The current state of waste management in many Indian cities, like Kanpur and Chennai, is characterized by overflowing landfills, inadequate segregation at source, and limited recycling infrastructure. Uncollected waste often accumulates in public spaces, posing significant health risks and environmental degradation. Rivers like the Ganga and Yamuna are particularly vulnerable, suffering from alarming levels of pollution due to improper waste disposal practices.", "normalised": "the current state of waste management in many indian cities, like kanpur and chennai, is characterized by overflowing landfills, inadequate segregation at source, and limited recycling infrastructure. uncollected waste often accumulates in public spaces, posing significant health risks and environmental degradation. rivers like the ganga and yamuna are particularly vulnerable, suffering from alarming levels of pollution due to improper waste disposal practices."}
{"unnormalised": "The Government of India, recognizing the urgency of the situation, has launched several initiatives such as the Swachh Bharat Mission to improve sanitation and waste management practices across the nation. Municipal corporations are increasingly exploring innovative solutions, including waste-to-energy plants and composting facilities. However, the success of these initiatives hinges on effective implementation and public participation. For instance, educating citizens on the importance of segregating waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories, akin to separating ingredients before cooking biryani, is paramount.", "normalised": "the government of india, recognizing the urgency of the situation, has launched several initiatives such as the swachh bharat mission to improve sanitation and waste management practices across the nation. municipal corporations are increasingly exploring innovative solutions, including waste to energy plants and composting facilities. however, the success of these initiatives hinges on effective implementation and public participation. for instance, educating citizens on the importance of segregating waste into biodegradable and non biodegradable categories, akin to separating ingredients before cooking biryani, is paramount."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, stricter enforcement of environmental regulations and increased investment in waste management infrastructure are crucial. Research institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) are actively involved in developing sustainable waste management technologies suitable for the Indian context. Moving towards a circular economy, where waste is viewed as a resource, is essential for creating a cleaner and healthier future for all Indians. This requires a collaborative effort from individuals, communities, and governing bodies. The future depends on us diligently addressing this pressing issue.", "normalised": "furthermore, stricter enforcement of environmental regulations and increased investment in waste management infrastructure are crucial. research institutions like the indian institute of technology (I I T) are actively involved in developing sustainable waste management technologies suitable for the indian context. moving towards a circular economy, where waste is viewed as a resource, is essential for creating a cleaner and healthier future for all indians. this requires a collaborative effort from individuals, communities, and governing bodies. the future depends on us diligently addressing this pressing issue."}
