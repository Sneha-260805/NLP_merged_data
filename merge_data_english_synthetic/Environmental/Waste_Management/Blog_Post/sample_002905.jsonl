{"unnormalised": "Traditional methods of waste disposal, predominantly open dumping and landfilling, are demonstrably inadequate. These practices contribute to soil and water contamination, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, they present breeding grounds for disease vectors, impacting vulnerable populations disproportionately. Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission have undoubtedly raised awareness and spurred action, yet a systemic shift towards integrated waste management solutions is crucial.", "normalised": "Traditional methods of waste disposal, predominantly open dumping and landfilling, are demonstrably inadequate.

{"unnormalised": "Effective implementation necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving government bodies, NGOs, private sector entities, and individual citizens. Stringent enforcement of regulations, coupled with public awareness campaigns, can create a conducive environment for responsible waste management practices. Financial incentives, such as tax rebates for adopting composting methods, can further encourage participation. Addressing this challenge requires significant investment – estimated in the Rs. 70,000 crore range over the next 5 years – particularly in upgrading existing infrastructure and developing new treatment facilities. Properly managed, waste isn’t just trash, it can be a resource, contributing to a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable India. The 10 km stretch near the Yamuna river, often choked with plastic, stands as a stark reminder of the urgency of this issue.", "normalised": "Effective implementation necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving government bodies, N G O's, private sector entities, and individual citizens.
