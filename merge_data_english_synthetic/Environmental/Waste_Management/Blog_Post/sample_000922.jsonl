Ever walked down Linking Road in Bandra and thought, \"Wow, that's a lot of…stuff?\" Well, that \"stuff\" is our kachra, our waste, and it’s a problem we gotta tackle head-on.

From the mountains of garbage outside your local sabzi mandi (like the one near Chandni Chowk on a Sunday!), to the overflowing bins near IIT-Delhi, we’re generating waste faster than a Bollywood film generates songs.

Separate your dry waste (paper, plastic, metal) from your wet waste (food scraps) *before* you toss it.
