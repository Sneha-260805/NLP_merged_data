{"unnormalised": "The key is better waste management. This isn't just about sweeping the streets (though that's important too!). It’s about reducing, reusing, and recycling. Remember your grandma's generation? They reused everything! Old sarees became dusters, newspapers were used for packing…they were masters of waste reduction! We can learn a lot from them.", "normalised": "The key is better waste management. This is not just about sweeping the streets (though that is important too!).

Let’s remember the spirit of independence we celebrated on 15/08/1947 and channel that same determination into fighting the waste problem. Perhaps the government can introduce more incentives for recycling and reward sustainable behaviour on 26/01/2024. It can also help to conduct local awareness programs at 14:00 hrs so everyone is aware. Let's make a conscious effort to manage waste better – for ourselves, for our children, and for the future of our beautiful Bharat.
