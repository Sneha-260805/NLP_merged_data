{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at IIT Madras, emphasizes the urgent need for improved waste segregation practices at the household level. Currently, a significant portion of waste ends up in landfills, contributing to soil and water contamination. Unsegregated waste also hinders efficient recycling processes. Municipal corporations like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are implementing initiatives to promote source segregation, but widespread adoption remains a hurdle.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at I I T Madras, emphasizes the urgent need for improved waste segregation practices at the household level.

These dumpsites often become breeding grounds for disease vectors and contribute to air pollution through the release of harmful gases. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has undeniably raised awareness, but sustained behavioural change is crucial for long-term success.", "normalised": "Open dumping is another major concern, especially in smaller towns and rural areas.

{"unnormalised": "Innovative technologies like waste-to-energy plants are gaining traction as a viable solution for managing non-recyclable waste. However, careful consideration must be given to emissions control and environmental impact assessments. The implementation of composting and vermicomposting techniques at the community level can also significantly reduce the volume of organic waste sent to landfills.", "normalised": "Innovative technologies like waste-to-energy plants are gaining traction as a viable solution for managing non-recyclable waste.

{"unnormalised": "Effective waste management also requires a robust regulatory framework and stringent enforcement. Penalties for illegal dumping and non-compliance with waste management rules must be consistently applied. Initiatives like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) are encouraging manufacturers to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products, particularly e-waste, which poses a serious environmental threat due to the presence of hazardous materials.", "normalised": "Effective waste management also requires a robust regulatory framework and stringent enforcement.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, investment in modern waste processing facilities, public awareness campaigns, and community participation are essential for achieving sustainable waste management practices in India. The financial burden, often measured in Rs. crores, of inadequate waste management far outweighs the cost of proactive and efficient solutions. Each household, each locality, and each institution, from the smallest panchayat covering a 5 sq km area to large corporations, has a role to play in transforming India's waste landscape. For instance, the municipality of Pune has shown success in decentralized waste management. Dates for future initiatives need to be set firmly.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, investment in modern waste processing facilities, public awareness campaigns, and community participation are essential for achieving sustainable waste management practices in India.
