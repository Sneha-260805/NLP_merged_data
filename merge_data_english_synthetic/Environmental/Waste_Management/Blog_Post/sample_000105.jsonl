Unsegregated waste clogs drains, exacerbates flooding during the monsoon season, and provides breeding grounds for disease vectors. Open burning of waste, a common sight in many cities like Kanpur, releases toxic pollutants into the air, impacting respiratory health.", "normalised": "Current practices often fall short.

However, sustained efforts are needed to translate awareness into effective action. This includes promoting source segregation of waste into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and hazardous categories. Municipal corporations like the Chennai Corporation should invest in modern waste processing technologies such as composting, biogas generation, and waste-to-energy plants.", "normalised": "The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a commendable initiative by the Government of India, has raised awareness about cleanliness and sanitation.

The cost of inaction is far greater than the Rs. required for investment. A cleaner, healthier India is not just a dream; it’s a necessity for sustainable development. This includes addressing waste generated from construction activities, ensuring proper disposal of debris from projects spanning hundreds of sq ft. Let us all pledge to reduce our waste footprint and contribute to a Swachh Bharat for generations to come. Even small changes, like composting kitchen waste in our homes, can make a significant difference.", "normalised": "Effective waste management requires a multi pronged approach: stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, increased public awareness, technological advancements, and community participation.
