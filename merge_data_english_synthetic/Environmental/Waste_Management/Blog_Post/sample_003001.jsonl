{"unnormalised": "Waste management in India presents a complex and pressing environmental challenge. The sheer volume of waste generated, coupled with inadequate infrastructure and public awareness, necessitates urgent and comprehensive action. From the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene backwaters of Kerala, the impact of unmanaged waste is palpable.", "normalised": "waste management in india presents a complex and pressing environmental challenge the sheer volume of waste generated coupled with inadequate infrastructure and public awareness necessitates urgent and comprehensive action from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene backwaters of Kerala the impact of unmanaged waste is palpable"}
{"unnormalised": "Current practices predominantly rely on open dumping and rudimentary landfill operations, leading to significant environmental degradation. Leachate contamination of groundwater resources, methane emissions contributing to climate change, and the proliferation of disease vectors are just some of the consequences. The informal waste sector, largely composed of marginalized communities like those involved in rag picking in Delhi's Seemapuri area, plays a crucial role in recycling but often operates under hazardous conditions without adequate social security.", "normalised": "current practices predominantly rely on open dumping and rudimentary landfill operations leading to significant environmental degradation leachate contamination of groundwater resources methane emissions contributing to climate change and the proliferation of disease vectors are just some of the consequences the informal waste sector largely composed of marginalized communities like those involved in rag picking in Delhi's Seemapuri area plays a crucial role in recycling but often operates under hazardous conditions without adequate social security"}
{"unnormalised": "Innovative solutions are desperately needed. Source segregation, composting, and waste-to-energy technologies offer viable alternatives to traditional methods. Municipal corporations like the one in Chennai are exploring decentralized waste management models, promoting community participation and reducing the burden on centralized facilities.

{"unnormalised": "However, sustained progress requires a multi-pronged approach. Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, increased investment in infrastructure, and widespread public awareness campaigns are essential. Consider the sheer amount of disposable plates and packaging generated during festivals like Onam; promoting the use of reusable alternatives can significantly reduce waste. Education programs in schools and communities, emphasizing the importance of responsible waste disposal habits, are also vital. We need a paradigm shift where waste is viewed not as a problem, but as a resource that can be recovered and utilized for the benefit of the environment and the economy. For example, turning vegetable scraps (often used to prepare biryani) into compost! The distance from a landfill to a village is, on average, about 10 km. The estimated fine for littering is Rs. 500 in many cities. Launched in 2014, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan plans to construct 111 million toilets. IIT Kanpur is involved in research in Solid Waste Management too.", "normalised": "however sustained progress requires a multi pronged approach stricter enforcement of environmental regulations increased investment in infrastructure and widespread public awareness campaigns are essential consider the sheer amount of disposable plates and packaging generated during festivals like Onam promoting the use of reusable alternatives can significantly reduce waste education programs in schools and communities emphasizing the importance of responsible waste disposal habits are also vital we need a paradigm shift where waste is viewed not as a problem but as a resource that can be recovered and utilized for the benefit of the environment and the economy for example turning vegetable scraps often used to prepare biryani into compost the distance from a landfill to a village is on average about ten kilometer the estimated fine for littering is rupee five hundred in many cities launched in two thousand and fourteen Swachh Bharat Abhiyan plans to construct one hundred and eleven million toilets I I T Kanpur is involved in research in Solid Waste Management too"}
