Organizations like TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) are doing amazing work in research and development of sustainable waste management solutions. And initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are definitely pushing the right buttons, even if implementation still needs improvement. Let’s hope the renewed focus after 2nd October helps.", "normalised": "Of course, the government plays a crucial role.

Think twice before buying that packaged snack, consider donating old clothes instead of throwing them away, and properly dispose of e-waste at designated collection centers.

But by taking small steps, educating ourselves, and holding our leaders accountable, we can make a real difference in tackling the waste crisis.
