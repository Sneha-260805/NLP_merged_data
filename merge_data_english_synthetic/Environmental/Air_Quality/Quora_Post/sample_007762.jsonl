{"unnormalised": "One major factor is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of vehicles, often older models with less stringent emission controls, contributes significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and other pollutants like NOx. Encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and improving public transport infrastructure are crucial. Initiatives like FAME India are steps in the right direction, but widespread adoption needs a bigger push.", "normalised": "One major factor is vehicular emissions.
