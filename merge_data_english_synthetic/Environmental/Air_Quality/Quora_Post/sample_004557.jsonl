{"unnormalised": "One major contributor is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of cars, trucks, and two-wheelers, many of which are older models with outdated emission standards (pre-Bharat Stage VI, for example), releases substantial pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The implementation of stricter emission norms, like Bharat Stage VI on 01/04/2020, is a step in the right direction, but enforcement remains key.", "normalised": "One major contributor is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Proposed solutions include: expanding public transportation, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), investing in renewable energy sources, stricter enforcement of emission norms, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and raising public awareness. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aim to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 levels by 20-30% by 2024 in identified cities. Further, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is implemented in Delhi-NCR when pollution reaches emergency levels, such as observed on 15/11/2023 at 14:00 hrs. However, long-term, sustainable solutions require a multi-pronged approach involving government, industry, and citizens.", "normalised": "Proposed solutions include: expanding public transportation, promoting electric vehicles (E V s), investing in renewable energy sources, stricter enforcement of emission norms, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and raising public awareness.
