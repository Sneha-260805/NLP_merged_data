The sheer number of vehicles, often older models with outdated emission standards, spews pollutants into the atmosphere, especially during peak hours like 09:00 hrs in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.", "normalised": "One major contributor is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Industrial emissions are another culprit. Factories, brick kilns, and power plants, especially those using coal, release harmful gases and particulate matter. We see this more acutely during winter when thermal inversion traps pollutants closer to the ground.", "normalised": "Industrial emissions are another culprit.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices, specifically stubble burning after the harvest season around October-November, contribute heavily to air pollution in North India. This creates a haze that blankets regions like Punjab and Haryana, affecting even Delhi. Think about the impact on visibility around Diwali!", "normalised": "Agricultural practices, specifically stubble burning after the harvest season around October-November, contribute heavily to air pollution in North India.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? We need a multi-pronged approach. Promoting public transport, investing in electric vehicles, and enforcing stricter emission norms are crucial. Industries need to adopt cleaner technologies and improve waste management. Farmers need to be incentivized to adopt alternative methods to stubble burning. Remember the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan? Similar dedicated initiatives for air quality are necessary. Individual actions, like using public transport and planting trees, also matter.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

{"unnormalised": "Finally, we need better monitoring and public awareness. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) needs to be readily accessible and understandable. Educating citizens about the risks of poor air quality is essential, particularly since events like the 75th Independence Day anniversary on 15/08/1947, are meant to celebrate a healthy nation. We need to protect the environment for future generations – aiming for a \"Shudh Hawa\" (clean air) revolution by 2047, the 100th year since independence. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, are steps in the right direction, with a goal to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (compared to 2017 levels), requiring a significant investment of approximately Rs. 6,897 crore in 102 non-attainment cities across India. We can't afford to ignore this issue any longer.", "normalised": "Finally, we need better monitoring and public awareness.
