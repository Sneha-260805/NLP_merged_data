{"unnormalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter enforcement of emission norms, promoting cleaner transportation options (e.g., electric vehicles), investing in renewable energy sources, improving waste management practices, and raising public awareness. Institutes like the TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) are actively researching and advocating for solutions. Implementing comprehensive strategies and holding stakeholders accountable is crucial to improving air quality and safeguarding public health in India. The cost to public health in terms of lost productivity and healthcare expenses is in the Rs. billions annually.", "normalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter enforcement of emission norms, promoting cleaner transportation options (e.g., electric vehicles), investing in renewable energy sources, improving waste management practices, and raising public awareness.
