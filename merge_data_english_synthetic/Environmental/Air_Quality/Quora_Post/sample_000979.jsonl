{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India, particularly in densely populated regions like Delhi-NCR and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, is a significant environmental and public health concern. The major contributors include vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, construction activities, agricultural practices such as stubble burning (especially pronounced after the Kharif harvest around October-November), and thermal power plants.", "normalised": "Air quality in India, particularly in densely populated regions like Delhi N C R and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, is a significant environmental and public health concern.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the persistently high levels of Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), often exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by several times. This poses severe respiratory and cardiovascular risks. In Delhi, for example, during the Diwali period (around 24/10/2022, for instance), air quality often plunges to \"severe\" levels, necessitating emergency measures.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the persistently high levels of Particulate Matter (P M two point five and P M ten), often exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards (N A A Q S) by several times.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government, along with state governments, is implementing various solutions. These include the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (baseline year 2017). Other initiatives involve promoting cleaner fuels (BS-VI standards), investing in public transport, enforcing stricter emission norms for industries, and addressing stubble burning through initiatives like providing farmers with alternative crop residue management technologies (e.g., happy seeders).", "normalised": "The Indian government, along with state governments, is implementing various solutions.

{"unnormalised": "The IITs and other research institutions like NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) are also actively involved in research and development of air pollution mitigation technologies. Public awareness campaigns are crucial, as is individual responsibility. Citizens can contribute by using public transport, carpooling, and avoiding the burning of waste. We need consistent efforts, policy implementation and societal change towards cleaner air quality. The annual 'Parali' burning post 15/04/2023 has caused massive harm, and only a multi-faceted collaborative approach will help overcome challenges from now onwards from 09:00 hrs to maintain the environmental balance.", "normalised": "The I I T s and other research institutions like N E E R I (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) are also actively involved in research and development of air pollution mitigation technologies.
