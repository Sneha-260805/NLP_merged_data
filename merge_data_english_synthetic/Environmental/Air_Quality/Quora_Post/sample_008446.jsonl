{"unnormalised": "**Question:** What can an average person in India realistically do to improve air quality in their city?", "normalised": "Hey everyone! Air quality in India, especially in cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and even smaller towns, is a serious concern. It's something we talk about during Diwali celebrations, with the post-firecracker smog, and especially in winter months. So what can we, as everyday citizens, actually do?"}
{"unnormalised": "**Answer:**", "normalised": "Firstly, think about your commute. Can you carpool, cycle, or take public transport? Even a few days a week can make a difference. Consider investing in a good quality mask, especially if you have respiratory problems. I remember my grandmother, Dadi, always covering her face with her dupatta, even before all this pollution talk! She’d say, “Better safe than sorry, beta.”"}

Promote proper waste segregation and composting within your community. Talk to your local corporator; they can actually make a difference if pushed!"}

Let's all meet at India Gate at nine A M on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four and brainstorm ideas together! I think even a small contribution of rupees one hundred towards a local tree-planting drive could add up. Every little bit helps. Think globally, act locally! Let's aim for breathable air within a five kilometer radius of our homes!"}
