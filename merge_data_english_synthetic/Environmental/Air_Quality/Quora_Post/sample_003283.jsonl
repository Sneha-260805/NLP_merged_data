Research and development by institutions like I I T-Delhi are crucial in developing cost-effective air purification technologies. Remember the message of social responsibility from Bollywood films like \"P K\" regarding environmental consciousness. Addressing air pollution requires a multi-faceted approach involving government, industry, and individual citizens. Improving air quality will require sustained effort and investment to protect the health of millions of Indians and preserve our environment. The government recently launched initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme with a budget of rupees seven hundred crore. Many areas consistently report A Q I values greater than three hundred, far exceeding W H O guidelines."}
