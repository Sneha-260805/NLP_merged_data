I feel like since Diwali on twenty fourth october two thousand and twenty two, it's just been a constant haze. My grandmother, Dadi, is perpetually coughing these days, and the doctor at A I I M S told us it’s definitely aggravated by the pollution. He even mentioned that air quality around nine hundred hours is generally worse due to morning traffic."}

Are there any good quality air purifiers anyone can recommend for a room that's about two hundred square feet? I saw some models online that cost around rupee fifteen thousand, but I’m not sure if they’re actually effective. Also, do we think the shift to B S V I emission standards for vehicles will actually make a significant difference in the long run, or is it just a drop in the ocean compared to the overall problem? Perhaps a mass plantation drive, like the one they did in Lucknow on fifteenth august two thousand and ten, could help? Curious to hear everyone's thoughts and any practical solutions you've come across."}
