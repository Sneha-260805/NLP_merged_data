The National Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently reports alarming levels, especially during the Diwali season and winter months.", "normalised": "Air quality in India, particularly in major urban centers like Delhi and Mumbai, presents a significant environmental and public health challenge.

{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the prevalence of vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of traffic, coupled with older vehicles not compliant with Bharat Stage VI emission norms, contributes heavily to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels. Addressing this requires stringent enforcement of vehicle emission standards and promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) via subsidies and infrastructure development, as incentivized by schemes like FAME India.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the prevalence of vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant factor is industrial pollution. Industries, particularly those operating in older zones, often lack adequate pollution control measures. Enforcement of environmental regulations under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, needs strengthening, including regular inspections and penalties for non-compliance.", "normalised": "Another significant factor is industrial pollution.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices, such as stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season around October-November, contribute significantly to air pollution in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Promoting alternative methods like in-situ decomposition and providing farmers with financial assistance through schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana are crucial.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices, such as stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season around October-November, contribute significantly to air pollution in the Indo-Gangetic plains.

{"unnormalised": "Effective solutions require a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological interventions, and public awareness campaigns. Monitoring AQI data, like that from the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) at 14:00 hrs on 01/01/2024, is crucial for informed decision-making. Perhaps a dedicated task force like the one proposed in the NCR region on 15/08/2023 could also assist. Public participation, such as reducing personal vehicle usage and adopting eco-friendly practices, is also vital. Clean air initiatives in cities like Indore (known for its Swachh Bharat Mission success) provide a model for other urban areas. Collaboration between institutions like IIT Delhi and NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) can drive innovation in air quality monitoring and mitigation technologies.", "normalised": "Effective solutions require a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological interventions, and public awareness campaigns.
