{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the high concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), primarily from vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction, and stubble burning in regions like Punjab and Haryana, especially around October-November annually. This leads to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and reduced life expectancy, particularly affecting vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. Recent studies from AIIMS, New Delhi, show alarming trends related to PM2.5 exposure.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the high concentration of particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), primarily from vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction, and stubble burning in regions like Punjab and Haryana, especially around October-November annually.

While initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) launched on 10/01/2019 aim to reduce air pollution, their implementation requires significant improvement. We need stronger emission standards for vehicles (BS-VI implemented from 01/04/2020), promotion of public transportation, and stricter penalties for industrial polluters.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inadequate monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations compound the problem.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, community participation is essential. Awareness campaigns educating citizens about the health impacts of air pollution and encouraging them to adopt eco-friendly practices, such as using public transport or carpooling, can make a significant difference. Consider the odd-even scheme trialled in Delhi around 11:00 hrs during peak pollution periods; while debated, it highlighted potential solutions. Robust data collection, accurate dissemination, and collaborative efforts between government agencies, research institutions, and citizens are necessary to achieve sustainable improvements in air quality across India.", "normalised": "Furthermore, community participation is essential.
