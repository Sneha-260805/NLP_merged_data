It's not just about visible smog; the microscopic pollutants can deeply impact our health, causing respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and even affecting cognitive functions.", "normalised": "Air quality in Delhi, and many other Indian cities, is a serious concern.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to Delhi's poor air quality. Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major culprit. The sheer number of cars, buses, and two-wheelers, many of them older models, spew out harmful gases. Secondly, industrial pollution from factories in and around Delhi, particularly in areas like Faridabad and Ghaziabad, releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to Delhi's poor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant factor is crop burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab after the harvest season. The smoke from these fires travels to Delhi, creating a choking haze. Construction dust from numerous building projects across the city also adds to the particulate matter in the air. During Diwali, firecrackers exacerbate the situation considerably. Remember that scene in the Bollywood film \"Delhi-6\"? Unfortunately, it's a recurring reality.", "normalised": "Another significant factor is crop burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab after the harvest season.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? A multi-pronged approach is needed. Stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries is crucial. Promoting public transport, like the Delhi Metro, and electric vehicles can reduce vehicular emissions. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi is actively researching air pollution solutions and cleaner technologies. Alternatives to crop burning need to be implemented, and awareness about the harmful effects of firecrackers needs to be raised. Finally, planting more trees and creating green spaces can help absorb pollutants. Improving air quality is a collective responsibility. Each small effort, from using public transport to planting a tree, makes a difference.", "normalised": "What can we do? A multi-pronged approach is needed.
