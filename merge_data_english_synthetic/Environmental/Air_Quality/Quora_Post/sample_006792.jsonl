Several factors contribute to this complex issue.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the prevalence of vehicular emissions, especially in metropolitan areas like Delhi and Mumbai. Older vehicles, often not compliant with Bharat Stage six emission norms implemented on first April two thousand and twenty, contribute heavily to particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten). Addressing this requires stricter enforcement and incentivizing the adoption of electric vehicles."}

Older vehicles, often not compliant with Bharat Stage VI emission norms implemented on 01/04/2020, contribute heavily to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). Addressing this requires stricter enforcement and incentivizing the adoption of electric vehicles.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices, particularly stubble burning post-harvest in states like Punjab and Haryana, also pose a seasonal but severe threat, drastically impacting air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plain around October-November each year. Solutions involve promoting alternative agricultural techniques and providing farmers with viable alternatives."}

Implementing and enforcing stringent emission standards, possibly inspired by Germany's \"Blue Angel\" certification, is crucial. Monitoring these emissions, especially around densely populated areas like Ghaziabad, requires advanced technology and robust regulatory oversight, working perhaps with institutions like I I T Kanpur which does significant research in this field."}

Promoting the use of public transport, cycling, and walking, along with educating citizens about the health risks associated with poor air quality (especially children like little Rohan on his way to school at seven thirty hours) are crucial long-term solutions. The financial burden on families treating respiratory illnesses, sometimes spending rupee fifty thousand or more a year, should be a stark motivator."}

Utilizing satellite data and ground-based monitoring stations to accurately assess air quality levels across different regions, even rural areas fifty kilometer from major cities, is necessary for informed policy decisions. The government's National Clean Air Programme (N C A P), launched in January two thousand and nineteen, aims to reduce particulate matter pollution by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four, a goal that requires sustained effort and inter-agency collaboration."}
