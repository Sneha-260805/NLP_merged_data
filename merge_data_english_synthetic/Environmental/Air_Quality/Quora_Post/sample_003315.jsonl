{"unnormalised": "Delhi NCR consistently battles poor air quality, particularly during the winter months. Several factors contribute to this alarming situation. Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major culprit. A large number of vehicles, many older and poorly maintained, ply the roads daily, especially during peak hours like 09:00 hrs, releasing pollutants.", "normalised": "Delhi N C R consistently battles poor air quality, particularly during the winter months.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India, along with the Delhi Government, is taking several steps. These include promoting the use of CNG vehicles, implementing the Odd-Even rule (although with debatable success), increasing public transport, and shutting down polluting industries during peak pollution periods.
