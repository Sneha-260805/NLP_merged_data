{"unnormalised": "One major culprit is vehicular emissions. With a rapidly growing population and increasing vehicle ownership, especially older, less fuel-efficient vehicles, the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere is substantial. Think of the morning rush hour on NH44 – the exhaust fumes are palpable.", "normalised": "One major culprit is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant factor is industrial pollution. Many industries, particularly those around places like Ludhiana and in the Ganga basin, release untreated or poorly treated effluents and emissions into the air. Enforcement of environmental regulations is often lax, especially in smaller industrial areas.", "normalised": "Another significant factor is industrial pollution.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices also contribute. The burning of crop residue after harvest, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana around October/November each year, releases massive amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants. This contributes significantly to the annual smog in Delhi, starting around 15/10.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices also contribute.

{"unnormalised": "Household pollution from burning wood and dung for cooking, especially in rural areas, is another important source. Even though LPG penetration is improving thanks to schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, many households still rely on traditional fuels. At 09:00 hrs on most days, you can see smoke plumes rising from villages.", "normalised": "Household pollution from burning wood and dung for cooking, especially in rural areas, is another important source.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries is crucial. Promoting public transportation, investing in cleaner energy sources (solar, wind), and subsidizing LPG cylinders further are important steps. For agriculture, providing farmers with alternative solutions for crop residue management and spreading awareness are essential. Ultimately, a multi-pronged approach is necessary to tackle this complex problem, remembering that India achieved independence on 15/08/1947, and we owe it to future generations to create a breathable environment. We also need better air quality monitoring systems, especially in smaller towns, and regular public awareness campaigns. For example, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Delhi publishes daily air quality indices, but access to this information needs to be improved.", "normalised": "What can be done?
