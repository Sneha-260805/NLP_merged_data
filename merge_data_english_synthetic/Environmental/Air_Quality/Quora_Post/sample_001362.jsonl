{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollution in the air we breathe. This pollution comes from various sources: vehicles, industrial emissions, construction dust, and even agricultural burning, particularly prevalent in areas surrounding Delhi during harvest season. Think about the smog scenes from films like \"Delhi 6\" - that's a visual representation of what poor air quality can look like.", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollution in the air we breathe.
