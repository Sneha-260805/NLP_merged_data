Several factors contribute to its deterioration. One major culprit is vehicular emissions, especially older vehicles plying the roads in cities like Delhi and Mumbai. The rise in private vehicle ownership and inadequate public transport infrastructure exacerbate this issue."}

Factories, often located near densely populated areas, release harmful pollutants into the air. Open burning of crop residue, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana post-harvest season (around October slash November), contributes heavily to smog, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

Stricter enforcement of emission norms for vehicles and industries is crucial. Promoting the use of electric vehicles and investing in robust public transport systems is essential. Encouraging farmers to adopt alternative methods of crop residue management (other than burning) with government subsidies is also needed."}

Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (N C A P), launched in two thousand and nineteen, are a step in the right direction. Regular air quality monitoring and dissemination of information to the public (perhaps via a mobile app updated at zero nine hundred hours daily) can empower people to take informed decisions. Furthermore, promoting clean cooking fuels like L P G and biogas in rural areas can significantly reduce indoor air pollution.

Individual actions like planting trees and reducing our reliance on personal vehicles can collectively make a difference. The fight for clean air is a shared responsibility."}
