Construction activities generate substantial dust, while industrial emissions from factories in areas like Ghaziabad contribute significantly to pollution levels. Agricultural practices like stubble burning, particularly prevalent in Punjab and Haryana post-harvest season around October-November, release massive amounts of particulate matter into the atmosphere. Furthermore, weather conditions like temperature inversions can trap pollutants, exacerbating the problem."}
