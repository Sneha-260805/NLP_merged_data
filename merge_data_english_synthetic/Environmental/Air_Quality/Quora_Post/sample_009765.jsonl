{"unnormalised": "The biggest threats are a complex mix: vehicular emissions are a huge culprit, especially in cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Think of all those auto-rickshaws and buses spewing fumes! Then there's industrial pollution from factories and power plants. Diwali celebrations, though culturally significant, add to the pollution with firecrackers releasing harmful PM2.5 particles. Agricultural practices like stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season (typically in October/November) choke the entire northern belt, sending the AQI into the red zone.", "normalised": "The biggest threats are a complex mix: vehicular emissions are a huge culprit, especially in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.
