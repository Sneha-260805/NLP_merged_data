{"unnormalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major concern. The sheer volume of vehicles, many of which are older and poorly maintained, releases significant amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). This is particularly pronounced during peak hours like 09:00 hrs and 17:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major concern.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, industrial emissions play a critical role. Industries located both within and on the periphery of cities release pollutants into the atmosphere. Even industries following norms sometimes contribute significantly, especially during periods of atmospheric inversion.", "normalised": "Secondly, industrial emissions play a critical role.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, meteorological factors like wind speed, temperature, and humidity can exacerbate the effects of pollutants. For example, during winter (December 25th-January 15th) when wind speeds are low, pollutants tend to accumulate, leading to severe air quality degradation. Addressing this requires a concerted effort involving government regulations, technological interventions, and public awareness campaigns. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is actively working on initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to mitigate these problems.", "normalised": "Finally, meteorological factors like wind speed, temperature, and humidity can exacerbate the effects of pollutants.
