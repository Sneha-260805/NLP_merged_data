{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India is a serious concern, impacting public health and the environment. Several factors contribute to its deterioration. One major culprit is vehicular emissions. The sheer number of cars, motorcycles, and trucks, especially older models, releasing pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide is alarming, particularly in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.", "normalised": "Air quality in India is a serious concern, impacting public health and the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Organisations like the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) are actively researching and advocating for better air quality management. We also need widespread public awareness campaigns. Remember the film *Delhi 6* and its depiction of the city choked by smog? That was a wake-up call.

Stricter implementation of existing regulations and public participation will play a major role to reduce 20% of air pollution in next 5 years.", "normalised": "Organisations like the Centre for Science and Environment (C S E) are actively researching and advocating for better air quality management.
