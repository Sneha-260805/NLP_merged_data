{"unnormalised": "Firstly, AQI is calculated based on the concentration of several key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). PM2.5, tiny particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are particularly dangerous because they can deeply penetrate the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Think of Diwali celebrations – while festive, the bursting of crackers significantly elevates PM2.5 levels.", "normalised": "Firstly, A Q I is calculated based on the concentration of several key pollutants like P M two point five, P M ten, Ozone (O three), Nitrogen Dioxide (N O two), Sulfur Dioxide (S O two), and Carbon Monoxide (C O).

Studies by institutions like IIT Kanpur are crucial in understanding the sources of this pollution, ranging from vehicular emissions to industrial activities. Even smaller cities, like Kanpur itself, and even towns in UP face seasonal spikes.", "normalised": "Secondly, air quality varies greatly across India.

Remember the movie \"Breathe\"? It highlights the challenges faced by people dependent on oxygen because of lung ailments, making you realize how vital clean air is.", "normalised": "Thirdly, prolonged exposure to poor air quality can lead to numerous health problems, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even increased cancer risk.

Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce air pollution by 20-30% by 2024 (based on 2017 levels). Rs. 10,000 crore have been allocated to tackle the issue.", "normalised": "Fourthly, individual actions can contribute to improving air quality.

Check resources like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website or apps like SAMEER to stay informed about the air quality in your area. Knowing the AQI and taking precautions like wearing masks during high pollution days can significantly reduce your exposure. Many sources claim the safe distance is less than 5 km from construction. The current AQI in my area is 150, which is moderate.", "normalised": "Finally, understanding your local A Q I data is crucial.
