{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the reliance on fossil fuels for energy production. Coal-fired power plants, particularly older ones operating with outdated technology, contribute significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulfur dioxide emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is crucial, but faces hurdles in terms of infrastructure investment and grid stability. We saw the initial push towards solar during the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission launched in 2010, but progress needs acceleration.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the reliance on fossil fuels for energy production.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical area is vehicular emissions. The growing number of vehicles on Indian roads, often older models with less stringent emission controls, releases harmful pollutants. The Bharat Stage VI emission standards, implemented from 01/04/2020, are a step in the right direction, but effective enforcement and promoting electric vehicle adoption are essential.", "normalised": "Another critical area is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices, particularly stubble burning after the harvest season, also contribute heavily to air pollution, especially in North India during October-November. Alternative methods for managing crop residue, such as using it as compost or for energy production, need to be promoted and incentivized. Education and awareness campaigns targeted at farmers, perhaps starting at 09:00 hrs on 15/08/2024, could improve adoption rates.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices, particularly stubble burning after the harvest season, also contribute heavily to air pollution, especially in North India during October-November.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, industrial emissions from factories and small-scale industries need to be strictly regulated and monitored. Many industries, particularly in less regulated areas, lack proper pollution control equipment. Strengthening environmental regulations and increasing enforcement efforts are paramount. The National Green Tribunal plays a vital role here.", "normalised": "Furthermore, industrial emissions from factories and small-scale industries need to be strictly regulated and monitored.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, public awareness and participation are essential for long-term success. Educating the public about the health impacts of air pollution and encouraging them to adopt sustainable practices can make a significant difference. We need to move beyond just discussing it over chai at 17:00 hrs and actively engage in solutions.", "normalised": "Finally, public awareness and participation are essential for long-term success.
