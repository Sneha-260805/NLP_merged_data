{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India, especially in metropolitan areas like Delhi and Mumbai, is a serious concern. The average Indian should be aware of a few key things. Firstly, understand the Air Quality Index (AQI). A good AQI is between 0-50, while anything above 300 is considered hazardous. Regularly check the AQI for your city using websites like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or apps like SAFAR-India, an initiative by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.", "normalised": "Air quality in India, especially in metropolitan areas like Delhi and Mumbai, is a serious concern.
