{"unnormalised": "Mitigation requires a multi-pronged approach. Stricter emission standards for vehicles (Bharat Stage VI implementation) are essential. Promoting public transportation, cycling, and electric vehicles can reduce reliance on private vehicles. Industries need to adopt cleaner technologies and install emission control devices. Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations is critical. Farmers need incentives and alternative methods to manage crop residue instead of burning it. For example, the PUSA decomposer, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), offers a promising solution. Public awareness campaigns, similar to those around Diwali and firecrackers (remember the film \"Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year\" and its emphasis on ethical business), can also help. Ultimately, addressing this issue requires sustained commitment and collaborative action from government, industry, and citizens. Rs. 10,000 crore investment might be needed. Air quality monitors, like those managed by CPCB, should be available in every city > 100,000 population and within 5 km radius of all industries.", "normalised": "Mitigation requires a multi-pronged approach.
