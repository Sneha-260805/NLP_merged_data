{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India presents a complex and pressing environmental challenge. Several factors contribute to this, including industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, agricultural practices like stubble burning (particularly prevalent around Diwali time), and construction activities.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India has launched several initiatives to combat air pollution. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched on 10/01/2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. BS-VI emission norms were implemented on 01/04/2020 to reduce vehicular emissions. The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is also implemented in Delhi-NCR during peak pollution periods. Additionally, institutions like IIT Delhi are actively involved in researching and developing innovative technologies for air pollution mitigation. Individual actions, such as using public transport and planting trees, also contribute to improvement efforts. Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-faceted approach involving government, industry, and citizens. It is crucial to ensure a clean and healthy environment for future generations.", "normalised": "The Government of India has launched several initiatives to combat air pollution.
