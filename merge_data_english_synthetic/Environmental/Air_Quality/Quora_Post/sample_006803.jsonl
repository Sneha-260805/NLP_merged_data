The levels of P M two point five and P M ten, particularly in urban centers like Delhi and Kanpur, consistently exceed W H O guidelines. This is a significant contributor to respiratory illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis, impacting the health of millions, especially children like young Rohan in my neighbourhood who has recurring breathing problems."}

Older vehicles, often poorly maintained, contribute significantly. Construction activities, especially in cities undergoing rapid development like Bangalore, raise dust levels considerably. Stubble burning by farmers in states such as Punjab and Haryana during the harvest season October to November each year also drastically worsens air quality, particularly impacting Delhi N C R. The infamous Diwali celebrations around fourteenth November two thousand and twenty saw a severe spike in pollution levels despite efforts to promote eco-friendly crackers."}

A classic example of this is the leather industry cluster in Kanpur, which releases untreated effluents and emissions into the environment."}

Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme N C A P, launched on tenth January two thousand and nineteen, are steps in the right direction. The deadline for achieving its targets is crucial to monitor and seventeen hundred hours on thirty first December two thousand and twenty four seems an appropriate time to review progress. Air purifiers, while offering some relief at home, are not a long-term solution. A systemic change is needed to ensure clean air for all Indians."}
