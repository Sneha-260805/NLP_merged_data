Carpooling, using public transport, planting trees, and even being mindful of not using too many firecrackers during festivals like Diwali or unnecessarily burning wood are all helpful steps. Maybe enjoy a healthier Onam Sadhya instead of smoky barbecue! Let's aim for a future where breathing clean air isn't a luxury, but a right for every Indian.
