{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air. Think particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). High levels of these pollutants can cause serious health problems, from respiratory illnesses like asthma to cardiovascular issues.", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air.

{"unnormalised": "In India, the problem is particularly acute, especially in cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Patna. Construction dust, vehicular emissions (often older vehicles not meeting BS VI standards), and industrial activity contribute significantly. Burning of agricultural residue in areas like Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest season creates a thick smog that blankets the entire Indo-Gangetic plain every winter. Remember the Diwali crackers? They add to the problem too.", "normalised": "In India, the problem is particularly acute, especially in cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Patna.

Individual actions like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (even small ones!), and avoiding burning waste can make a difference. Let's strive for a 'Swachh Hawa' for a healthier India. Think about it – it impacts everyone from that rickshaw-puller in Chandni Chowk to the CEO in Gurgaon. Even our beloved Bollywood stars are breathing the same air! So let's make a change. For ourselves, and for future generations. A healthier India can save thousands of Rs. on healthcare in the long run.
