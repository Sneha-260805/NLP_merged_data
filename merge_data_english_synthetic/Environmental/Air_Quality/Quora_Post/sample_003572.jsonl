On the one hand, we're seeing initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme and more electric vehicles on the road. My cousin, Priya, just bought a Tata Nexon E V. Small steps, right?

Or are we actually making tangible progress? I'd love to hear your perspectives, especially if you have data or anecdotal experiences to share. Are things actually getting better in Mumbai, Bangalore, or Chennai, or are we just kidding ourselves? What can ordinary citizens like you and I do besides wearing masks (rupees fifty each, anyone?) during peak pollution times? Let's discuss! Let me know your experiences or opinions, especially if you live in slash near major Indian cities. Has the air quality improved since fifteenth August nineteen forty seven?"}
