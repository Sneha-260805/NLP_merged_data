{"unnormalised": "Addressing these concerns requires a multi-pronged approach. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (base year 2017). Other measures include promoting electric vehicles, improving public transport, implementing stricter emission norms, and raising public awareness. Research institutions like IIT Delhi are also actively involved in developing innovative solutions. The success of these measures depends on stringent enforcement, public participation, and sustained commitment. Individual responsibility, such as using public transport when possible and reducing waste burning, also plays a critical role.", "normalised": "Addressing these concerns requires a multi-pronged approach.
