Several factors contribute to this, including vehicular emissions, industrial pollutants, construction dust, and agricultural practices such as stubble burning, which peaks around October-November each year."}
{"unnormalised": "**What are the most pressing air quality concerns in India, and what measures are being taken to address them?**", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the consistently high levels of particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), often exceeding national and international safety standards. This leads to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and other serious health complications. Studies by institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (A I I M S), Delhi, have linked long-term exposure to poor air quality to decreased life expectancy."}

The National Clean Air Programme (N C A P), launched on tenth january two thousand and nineteen, aims to reduce P M two point five and P M ten concentrations by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four, using two thousand and seventeen as the base year. Initiatives include promoting cleaner fuels, improving public transportation (like the Delhi Metro), enforcing stricter emission norms (Bharat Stage V I), and regulating construction activities. There's also been a push towards electric vehicles (E V s), with subsidies offered to encourage adoption."}

Effective enforcement of regulations, public awareness campaigns, and collaboration between different stakeholders (government, industry, and citizens) are crucial. Stubble burning, a practice deeply rooted in the agricultural cycle, requires sustainable and economically viable alternatives for farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Monitoring at two P M every day is essential. Continued research and innovation are needed to develop and implement effective air pollution control technologies. It's a complex issue requiring a multi-pronged approach and sustained commitment to ensure cleaner air for all Indians. Diwali celebrations on twenty fourth october two thousand and twenty two, for example, led to a temporary spike in pollution levels, highlighting the need for more stringent regulations on firecrackers."}
