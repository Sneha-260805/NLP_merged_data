{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant environmental challenge, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kanpur. The major challenges stem from a complex interplay of factors, including vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, construction activities, agricultural practices (like stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab), and even seasonal weather patterns. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are key pollutants of concern.", "normalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant environmental challenge, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kanpur. The major challenges stem from a complex interplay of factors, including vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, construction activities, agricultural practices like stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab, and even seasonal weather patterns.

Studies, including those from IIT Delhi, indicate that prolonged exposure significantly impacts public health, with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable.", "normalised": "Poor air quality has severe health consequences, contributing to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, even premature mortality.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government is implementing various measures to address this issue. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. This includes promoting the use of cleaner fuels, investing in public transportation, enforcing stricter emission norms for vehicles (Bharat Stage VI), and regulating industrial emissions.", "normalised": "The Indian government is implementing various measures to address this issue.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, public awareness campaigns are crucial. The movie \"Breath: Into the Shadows\" touched upon the anxiety and health problems caused by pollution in Delhi. More such efforts are needed to encourage individual responsibility and support for cleaner practices. For instance, planting trees (even just near one's house), using public transport for short distances (say less than 5 km), and supporting industries with improved emission control technologies are beneficial. Addressing air quality necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving government regulations, technological advancements, and citizen participation to create a healthier and more sustainable environment for all.", "normalised": "Furthermore, public awareness campaigns are crucial.
