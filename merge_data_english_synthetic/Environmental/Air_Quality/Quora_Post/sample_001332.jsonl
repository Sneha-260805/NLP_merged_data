{"unnormalised": "One major issue is vehicular emissions. The sheer number of vehicles on the road, coupled with older, less fuel-efficient models, contributes significantly to pollution. Implementing stricter emission norms, promoting electric vehicles, and improving public transport are crucial but face resistance due to cost and infrastructure limitations. For example, the push to implement BS-VI emission standards was met with initial hesitation due to its impact on vehicle prices.", "normalised": "One major issue is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices also play a significant role. Crop burning, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana after the Kharif season, contributes immensely to the annual smog in North India. While there are alternative agricultural techniques available, farmers often find them more expensive or less efficient in the short term. Educating and incentivizing farmers to adopt sustainable practices is key.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices also play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "Industrial emissions are another major culprit. Many factories, particularly in older industrial areas, lack adequate pollution control measures. Enforcement of environmental regulations is often lax, due to corruption and resource constraints within regulatory bodies.
