Several factors contribute to the degraded air quality observed, particularly in urban centres like Delhi and Kanpur.", "normalised": "One major threat is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of vehicles, coupled with older engines and inadequate emission standards, releases substantial amounts of particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), nitrogen oxides (N O x), and carbon monoxide (C O). The shift towards B S-V I emission norms is a step in the right direction, but enforcement remains crucial."}
