Several factors contribute to the haze we often see, especially during winters.", "normalised": "One major contributor is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of cars, buses, and two-wheelers, many of which are older models with less efficient engines, spews out pollutants like particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Think of the traffic in Delhi during Diwali – a potent combination of firecracker smoke and already high vehicle emissions."}

Remember the constant construction around Bengaluru's Outer Ring Road?", "normalised": "To improve air quality, several steps can be taken. Promoting public transport, investing in electric vehicles, and enforcing stricter emission norms are crucial. Industries need to adopt cleaner technologies and implement pollution control measures. Stricter regulations on construction activities and promoting sustainable agricultural practices (like using happy seeders to avoid stubble burning) are essential. Air purifiers can help at a personal level. Even small changes like opting for a vegetarian biryani occasionally instead of a meat-heavy one (reducing livestock emissions) can have a collective positive impact. Addressing this complex problem requires a multi-pronged approach and commitment from individuals, businesses, and the government."}
