These tiny particulate pollutants, smaller than 2.5 micrometers, can penetrate deep into our lungs and even enter our bloodstream, causing respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and other serious health issues. The sources are varied: vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and even burning agricultural residue.", "normalised": "Think of cities like Delhi, often in the news for its dangerously high P M two point five levels.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Individual actions *do* make a difference. Consider using public transport, carpooling, or cycling. Support policies that promote cleaner fuels and stricter emission standards. Invest in air purifiers for your homes, especially if you have children or elderly family members. We also need more rigorous monitoring and transparent data dissemination, perhaps similar to the environmental studies conducted by IIT Madras or the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Remember, breathing clean air is a fundamental right. Let's work together to improve air quality for everyone, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari!", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
