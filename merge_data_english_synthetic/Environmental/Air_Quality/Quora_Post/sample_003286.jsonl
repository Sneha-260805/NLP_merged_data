{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India remains a significant environmental challenge, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The most pressing concerns are high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone pollution, and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants contribute to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.", "normalised": "Air quality in India remains a significant environmental challenge, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to this problem, including vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, crop burning (especially in regions like Punjab and Haryana), and the widespread use of solid fuels for cooking in rural areas. During Diwali, the bursting of firecrackers exacerbates the situation, leading to dangerously high pollution levels.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to this problem, including vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, crop burning (especially in regions like Punjab and Haryana), and the widespread use of solid fuels for cooking in rural areas.

{"unnormalised": "Potential solutions require a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, stricter emission standards for vehicles and industries are crucial, along with promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and public transport. Secondly, improving waste management practices and reducing open burning can significantly reduce pollution. Thirdly, investing in renewable energy sources and phasing out coal-fired power plants is essential.", "normalised": "Potential solutions require a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) is actively involved in air quality research and forecasting. Furthermore, raising public awareness is vital; even films like \"Breathe: Into the Shadows\" have touched upon the impact of air pollution on human health, demonstrating its societal relevance. Effective implementation of policies and public participation are key to improving air quality for a healthier future. We need a sustained effort, not just knee-jerk reactions during crisis periods. In cities like Chennai, even coastal areas are not immune to the effects of air pollution from inland sources hundreds of km away. We need to bring PM2.5 levels down from dangerous levels of say 200 micrograms/cubic meter to WHO standards. It's a matter of public health, costing the country in Rs. Trillions annually. The situation requires immediate and focused attention.", "normalised": "The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (I I T M) is actively involved in air quality research and forecasting.
