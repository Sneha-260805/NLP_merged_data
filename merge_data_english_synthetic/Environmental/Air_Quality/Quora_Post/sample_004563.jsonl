{"unnormalised": "The lack of robust, real-time monitoring networks across all regions also hinders effective policy implementation. Data from institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is valuable, but wider coverage is needed. Public awareness campaigns, like those initiated on Diwali day 2022, also need to be more frequent and informative to empower citizens to take mitigating actions. Finally, effective inter-state coordination is vital, as air pollution transcends geographical boundaries.", "normalised": "The lack of robust, real-time monitoring networks across all regions also hinders effective policy implementation.
