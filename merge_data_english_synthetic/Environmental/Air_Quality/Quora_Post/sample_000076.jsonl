{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant environmental and public health challenge, particularly in densely populated urban areas. The concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), along with pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), frequently exceeds permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).", "normalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant environmental and public health challenge, particularly in densely populated urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the impact on respiratory health, especially among children and the elderly. Studies conducted by institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi have shown a direct correlation between poor air quality and increased incidence of asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, long-term exposure to air pollution has been linked to cardiovascular diseases and even certain types of cancer.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the impact on respiratory health, especially among children and the elderly.

{"unnormalised": "Various solutions are being implemented and proposed. These include: the promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) through government subsidies, the adoption of Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms, stricter enforcement of industrial emission standards, and efforts to curb stubble burning through incentives and alternative farming techniques. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024.", "normalised": "Various solutions are being implemented and proposed.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, increased public awareness is crucial. Even Bollywood has touched upon environmental issues; for example, movies often subtly showcase the need for greener practices, influencing public perception. Individual actions, such as using public transport or carpooling, can also contribute to improving air quality. The challenge remains complex, requiring sustained and coordinated efforts from government, industry, and individuals.", "normalised": "Furthermore, increased public awareness is crucial.
