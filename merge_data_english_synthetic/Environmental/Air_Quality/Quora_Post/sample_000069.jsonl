{"unnormalised": "What exactly contributes to this? Several factors are at play. Industrial emissions from factories, power plants (especially coal-fired ones), and brick kilns are major culprits. Vehicle exhaust, particularly from older vehicles and diesel engines, adds significantly to the problem, especially in congested urban areas like Mumbai and Bangalore. Agricultural practices, such as burning crop residue after the harvest season, are another significant source. Think of the impact on Punjab and Haryana after the Diwali harvest!", "normalised": "What exactly contributes to this? Several factors are at play.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Stricter emission controls for vehicles and industries are essential. Promoting cleaner energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can significantly reduce pollution. Public awareness campaigns, encouraging people to use public transport, carpool, or switch to electric vehicles, are also crucial. Planting more trees is another long-term solution. Individuals can also contribute by properly disposing of waste and reducing their consumption of fossil fuels. Improving air quality in India requires a collective effort! It affects our health, our economy, and the future generations of our country. The problem feels overwhelming but small consistent actions, coupled with systemic changes, can add up to a big difference.", "normalised": "What can be done?
