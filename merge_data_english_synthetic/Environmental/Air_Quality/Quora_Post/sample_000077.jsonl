{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant and multifaceted environmental challenge. Major concerns include the alarming levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in numerous cities, particularly during the winter months. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, encompassing regions like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, consistently registers some of the worst air quality indices globally.", "normalised": "Air quality in India presents a significant and multifaceted environmental challenge.

{"unnormalised": "These pollutants stem from a combination of sources: vehicular emissions, industrial activity, agricultural practices like stubble burning (parali), construction, and even domestic cooking using solid fuels. The health impacts are far-reaching, contributing to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even increased cancer rates. Studies, including research from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), highlight the devastating impact on public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.", "normalised": "These pollutants stem from a combination of sources: vehicular emissions, industrial activity, agricultural practices like stubble burning (parali), construction, and even domestic cooking using solid fuels.

These include the adoption of Bharat Stage VI emission norms for vehicles, initiatives promoting electric vehicles, stricter enforcement of industrial emission standards, and efforts to encourage sustainable agricultural practices. The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is implemented in Delhi during periods of severe air pollution. However, effective enforcement and widespread adoption of these solutions remain challenges.", "normalised": "Solutions being implemented are diverse.

One might even argue that films like \"Pink\" (while not directly about air pollution) touch upon the broader theme of societal responsibility and the need for a cleaner, healthier environment.", "normalised": "The severity of the issue is often portrayed in media, sometimes subtly.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, addressing India's air quality crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological advancements, public awareness campaigns, and individual responsibility. The Rs. 10,000 crore package allocated to states for pollution control is a step, but sustained effort and innovation are crucial to achieving meaningful improvements. The situation demands continuous monitoring, adaptive strategies, and long-term commitment to safeguarding public health and the environment. We need to aim for air quality levels that meet WHO standards, not just tolerate levels that are simply \"less bad\" than before.", "normalised": "Ultimately, addressing India's air quality crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological advancements, public awareness campaigns, and individual responsibility.
