{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air. We measure it using the Air Quality Index (AQI). An AQI of 0-50 is considered good, while anything above 300 is hazardous. Higher AQI values mean more pollutants and greater health risks.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air. We measure it using the Air Quality Index (A Q I).
