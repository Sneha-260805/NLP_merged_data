Air quality is assessed using various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. These are often measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).", "normalised": "We often see reports during Diwali about how bad the air quality gets in Delhi N C R, sometimes reaching A Q I levels above four hundred!
