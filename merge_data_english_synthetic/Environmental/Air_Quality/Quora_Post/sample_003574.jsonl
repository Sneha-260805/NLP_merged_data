I live in Gurgaon, near Delhi, and honestly, the news reports often make it sound apocalyptic. Is Delhi air *really* as bad as they say? We see those A Q I numbers flashing on T V – four hundred, five hundred…scary stuff!"}

Planting trees is great, but we need systemic changes. Things like stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles (especially older ones), investing in public transport (like the Delhi Metro – so efficient!), and promoting cleaner energy sources. Even small things like carpooling or avoiding burning waste can help.
