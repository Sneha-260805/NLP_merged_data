{"unnormalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major culprit. The sheer volume of vehicles on the roads, especially older models, releases substantial amounts of pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). The increasing number of two-wheelers and cars, particularly in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, exacerbates the problem.", "normalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions are a major culprit.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, industrial emissions from factories and power plants contribute significantly. Many industries, particularly in older industrial zones, still rely on outdated technologies that release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. The impact can be particularly severe in areas near industrial hubs like Ghaziabad or around thermal power plants.", "normalised": "Secondly, industrial emissions from factories and power plants contribute significantly.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, construction activities and dust contribute heavily, particularly during the dry season. Construction projects release massive amounts of dust and particulate matter into the air, leading to respiratory problems. Burning of agricultural waste, often practiced in North Indian states after the harvest season around October-November, further worsens the situation. This is particularly acute around Diwali, especially in areas like Punjab and Haryana.", "normalised": "Thirdly, construction activities and dust contribute heavily, particularly during the dry season.

{"unnormalised": "Mitigation strategies include promoting public transport, transitioning to cleaner fuels, stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries, adopting better construction practices to minimize dust, and implementing measures to curb agricultural waste burning. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (using 2017 as the base year). Further, investing in research and development for cleaner technologies and raising public awareness are crucial steps towards improving air quality for future generations. Initiatives like odd-even schemes, first implemented in Delhi in January 2016 and again on 04/11/2019, while controversial, highlight the urgency of the situation.", "normalised": "Mitigation strategies include promoting public transport, transitioning to cleaner fuels, stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries, adopting better construction practices to minimize dust, and implementing measures to curb agricultural waste burning.
