{"unnormalised": "One major issue is vehicular emissions, particularly from older vehicles and those operating on adulterated fuel. The sheer volume of traffic, especially during peak hours like 08:00 hrs and 18:00 hrs, exacerbates the problem. Stricter enforcement of emission norms, similar to the Bharat Stage VI standards implemented nationwide, is crucial but requires continuous monitoring.", "normalised": "One major issue is vehicular emissions, particularly from older vehicles and those operating on adulterated fuel.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter regulations, technological advancements, public awareness campaigns, and behavioral changes. Institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and IIT Delhi are actively involved in research and policy recommendations, but comprehensive action is needed at the national and local levels. For example, Delhi's odd-even scheme, implemented periodically, demonstrated the complexities and limitations of such measures. The cost of air purifiers for individual homes is also a burden for many citizens. Data from 15/08/2023, showed particulate matter exceeding permissible limits by a considerable margin in several cities.", "normalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter regulations, technological advancements, public awareness campaigns, and behavioral changes.
