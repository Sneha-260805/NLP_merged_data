Celebrating Diwali responsibly, with reduced firecracker usage after the 08:00 PM - 10:00 PM window permitted by the Supreme Court, is one such example. Combating air pollution requires a multi-faceted approach involving governmental policies, technological advancements, and individual responsibility.
