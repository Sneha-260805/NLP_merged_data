{"unnormalised": "One significant source is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of traffic, coupled with older vehicles and varying fuel quality, releases substantial amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. Stricter emission standards, like those implemented on 01/04/2023, and a faster transition to electric vehicles are crucial, but enforcement remains inconsistent.", "normalised": "One significant source is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Another major contributor is industrial pollution. Unregulated or poorly regulated industries, especially in the states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, discharge harmful pollutants into the air. The implementation of stricter environmental regulations and rigorous monitoring are essential. Many factories still rely on outdated technologies dating back to the 1980s.", "normalised": "Another major contributor is industrial pollution.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural practices also play a role. Stubble burning, particularly in Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season around November each year, releases massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter. Promoting alternative and sustainable agricultural practices is key to addressing this issue.", "normalised": "Agricultural practices also play a role.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, construction activities in rapidly growing cities also cause significant dust pollution. Effective dust control measures, such as covering construction sites and regular watering, are vital. A program launched by IIT Delhi on 10/01/2024 at 14:00 hrs, aimed at using AI to predict and mitigate dust pollution, shows promise. A combined effort from the government, industries, and citizens is needed to achieve cleaner air for all, especially as we head into Diwali each year. The Ganga Action Plan also indirectly contributes.", "normalised": "Finally, construction activities in rapidly growing cities also cause significant dust pollution.
