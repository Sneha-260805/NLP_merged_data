{"unnormalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions remain a significant contributor, particularly in urban centers like Delhi and Mumbai. Older vehicles, often poorly maintained, exacerbate the problem. Stricter enforcement of emission standards, promotion of electric vehicles (EVs), and improved public transportation are crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, public awareness and engagement are vital. Educating citizens about the health impacts of air pollution and encouraging them to adopt sustainable practices can make a significant difference. We need to empower communities like those around IIT-Kanpur to monitor and advocate for cleaner air. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological innovations, and individual responsibility. A national target of achieving acceptable air quality levels by, say, 2030 at 10:00 hrs seems ambitious but necessary. The cost of inaction, in terms of public health and economic productivity, is simply too high.", "normalised": "Finally, public awareness and engagement are vital.
