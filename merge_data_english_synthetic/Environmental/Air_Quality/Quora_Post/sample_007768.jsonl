{"unnormalised": "Secondly, industrial pollution plays a huge role. Factories, particularly around industrial hubs like Surat and Kanpur, often release harmful chemicals and particulate matter into the air. Thirdly, agricultural practices like stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest season contribute significantly to the air pollution that chokes the northern plains.", "normalised": "Secondly, industrial pollution plays a huge role.

{"unnormalised": "Indoor air pollution is also a silent killer, especially in rural areas, where burning wood or dung for cooking is common. Imagine families in villages preparing their daily meals – even a simple dish like daal and rice can contribute to harmful indoor air pollution.", "normalised": "Indoor air pollution is also a silent killer, especially in rural areas, where burning wood or dung for cooking is common.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Solutions are multifaceted. Promoting public transportation, transitioning to electric vehicles, enforcing stricter emission standards for industries (including financial penalties for non-compliance - perhaps Rs. 5 Lakhs per violation), and investing in cleaner cooking technologies are crucial. Encouraging alternatives to stubble burning, such as using the residue for composting or energy generation, is also vital.", "normalised": "What can we do? Solutions are multifaceted.
