{"unnormalised": "Firstly, rampant industrial emissions, particularly from older coal-fired power plants and factories in states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, release harmful pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Many factories operate with outdated technologies and lax enforcement of environmental regulations.", "normalised": "Firstly, rampant industrial emissions, particularly from older coal-fired power plants and factories in states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, release harmful pollutants like particulate matter (P M two point five, P M ten), sulfur dioxide (S O two), and nitrogen oxides (N O x).

{"unnormalised": "Solutions being explored include stricter enforcement of environmental regulations by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), promoting cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Encouraging electric vehicle adoption through subsidies and infrastructure development is also crucial. Campaigns promoting public awareness and discouraging stubble burning, such as those held on National Environment Day (June 5th), are also important. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 in identified cities. Investing in public transport systems and improving traffic management in cities are vital. Finally, the development and implementation of effective waste management strategies is also important. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi is actively involved in researching air quality monitoring technologies and solutions.", "normalised": "Solutions being explored include stricter enforcement of environmental regulations by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B), promoting cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
