{"unnormalised": "India faces a significant air quality crisis, particularly in densely populated urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The sources of pollution are multifaceted, ranging from vehicular emissions (especially older vehicles pre-BS VI standards) to industrial activities and construction dust. Agricultural practices, particularly the burning of crop residue after harvest in states like Punjab and Haryana, contribute heavily during the winter months. We often see alarming AQI levels reported around Diwali (typically in Oct/Nov), exacerbated by fireworks.", "normalised": "India faces a significant air quality crisis, particularly in densely populated urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.

{"unnormalised": "A major challenge is the decentralized nature of pollution sources and the difficulty in enforcing regulations effectively. While the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and bodies like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) play crucial roles, ground-level implementation often lags. Public awareness is also key.", "normalised": "A major challenge is the decentralized nature of pollution sources and the difficulty in enforcing regulations effectively.

{"unnormalised": "However, several positive developments are underway. The push for electric vehicles (EVs) is gaining momentum, particularly with governmental incentives. Projects like the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) aim to reduce road congestion and consequently, emissions. Furthermore, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), activated during peak pollution periods (often around 09:00 hrs in winter mornings), helps to curb polluting activities. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, promoting cleaner cooking fuels, are reducing indoor air pollution in rural households. We must also acknowledge the crucial research happening at institutions like IIT Delhi, which are developing innovative air purification technologies. Significant progress requires sustained effort and investment, with a long-term vision extending beyond immediate political cycles, especially considering the alarming reports issued around 26/01/2024. We need coordinated action to ensure breathable air for generations to come, moving beyond reactive measures adopted only after reports like those published on 15/08/2023 detailing critical pollution levels.", "normalised": "However, several positive developments are underway.
