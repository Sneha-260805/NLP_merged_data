{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the consistently high levels of Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), exceeding permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Studies conducted by institutions like IIT Kanpur have linked prolonged exposure to these pollutants to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even reduced life expectancy. Recent data from 10/10/2024 indicates PM2.5 levels were significantly elevated in several cities.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the consistently high levels of Particulate Matter (P M two point five and P M ten), exceeding permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (W H O) and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
