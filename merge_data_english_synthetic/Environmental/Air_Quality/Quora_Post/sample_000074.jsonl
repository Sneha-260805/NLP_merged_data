{"unnormalised": "Addressing this multifaceted problem requires a multi-pronged approach. The TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) has conducted extensive research on air quality and proposes solutions including promoting public transportation, transitioning to cleaner fuels, implementing stricter emission norms for vehicles and industries, and providing financial incentives to farmers to adopt alternative methods to stubble burning. Also, as the film \"Breathe: Into the Shadows\" highlights the desperate measures people may resort to due to respiratory issues, ensuring clean air is a basic human right. Investing in air purification technologies and enforcing existing environmental regulations are also crucial. Finally, raising public awareness and encouraging individual responsibility, such as carpooling and using public transport, are vital components of a long-term solution. Continuous monitoring and reporting of AQI, along with consistent implementation of policies, are necessary to bring Delhi's air quality within acceptable limits.", "normalised": "Addressing this multifaceted problem requires a multi-pronged approach.
