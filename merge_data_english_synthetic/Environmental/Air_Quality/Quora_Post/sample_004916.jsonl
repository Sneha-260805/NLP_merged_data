{"unnormalised": "**What's the real deal with air quality, and why should I care, especially in India?**", "normalised": "Air quality, put simply, refers to how clean or polluted the air we breathe is. It's a crucial environmental factor impacting public health. High levels of air pollution, often measured by P M two point five, P M ten, Ozone, etcetera, can cause a range of health problems, from respiratory illnesses like asthma to heart disease and even cancer."}

Increased hospital admissions for respiratory problems, schools sometimes getting closed due to smog, and even just a general feeling of discomfort are all signs.

Reducing vehicle usage, planting more trees (think of the Miyawaki forest projects!), supporting policies that promote cleaner energy, and reducing our individual carbon footprint all contribute to improving air quality for ourselves and future generations. Even small steps, like properly disposing of waste to prevent burning, matter. We need to take action collectively to safeguard the air we breathe."}
