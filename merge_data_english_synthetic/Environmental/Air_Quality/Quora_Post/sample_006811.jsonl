{"unnormalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach. Investing in cleaner transportation, such as electric vehicles and improved public transport, is crucial. Stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries is also necessary. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) needs increased resources and authority. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices to reduce crop burning is essential. Encouraging research and development in air pollution control technologies at institutions like IIT Delhi will also contribute significantly. We can look back to the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, enacted on 16/05/1981, and consider its effectiveness in the current landscape. Finally, raising public awareness and encouraging individual responsibility, like using public transport more, are crucial for long-term improvement. Addressing this is vital for the health and well-being of millions of Indians.", "normalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach.
