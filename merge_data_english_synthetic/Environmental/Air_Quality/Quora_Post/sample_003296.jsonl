{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India is a significant environmental and public health concern, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The major sources of pollution are diverse, ranging from vehicular emissions (especially older vehicles predating BS-VI standards) and industrial discharge to construction dust and the burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana post-harvest, typically around October-November. Diwali celebrations, especially around 20:00 hrs on Diwali night, further exacerbate the issue with firecracker emissions.", "normalised": "Air quality in India is a significant environmental and public health concern, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.

The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (with 2017 as the base year). The promotion of electric vehicles through schemes like FAME-II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II) is also crucial. Furthermore, enforcement of stricter emission norms for industries and vehicles, coupled with public awareness campaigns spearheaded by organizations like the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), are being implemented. Real-time air quality monitoring stations, particularly around 10:00 hrs to assess the morning rush, provide data to inform policy decisions. The implementation of odd-even schemes in cities like Delhi, although temporary, attempts to curb vehicular pollution. Agricultural interventions, such as providing subsidies for alternative stubble management techniques, are also gaining traction, especially after the 26/01/2001 earthquake that highlighted vulnerabilities. Sustained and concerted efforts are vital to ensuring breathable air for all Indians.", "normalised": "Several initiatives are underway to combat this.
