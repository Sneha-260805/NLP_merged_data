The increasing number of vehicles, often poorly maintained or running on older engine technology, releases harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.

This practice, typically occurring between October and November, blankets cities like Delhi in smog, impacting visibility and respiratory health.

Campaigns to educate the public about the health impacts of air pollution and encourage responsible behavior are crucial. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aim to address these challenges holistically, with a target of reducing particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024.
