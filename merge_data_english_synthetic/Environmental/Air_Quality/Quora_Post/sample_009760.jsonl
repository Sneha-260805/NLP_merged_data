The economic impact is also substantial; think of lost productivity due to illness and increased healthcare costs, potentially costing the Indian economy Rs. billions annually. Even simple steps like using N95 masks during peak pollution days can help protect your health. Measuring air quality even at home, with devices available for under Rs. 5,000, is now accessible.
