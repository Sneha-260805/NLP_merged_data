{"unnormalised": "**What are the biggest challenges to improving air quality in India, and what innovative solutions are being explored?**", "normalised": "Air quality in India presents a multifaceted environmental challenge. Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and agricultural practices contribute significantly. Cities like Delhi, often exceeding W H O guidelines, become cautionary tales. The pervasive use of older vehicles, particularly those failing emission standards, exacerbates the problem. Construction dust, uncontrolled industrial emissions (especially around industrial hubs like Faridabad), and the burning of crop residue in Punjab and Haryana during harvest season (around October to November each year) are major contributors."}

These include the use of smog towers (like the one in Delhi), promotion of electric vehicles (E V s) through schemes like F A M E India, encouraging the adoption of cleaner cooking fuels through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, and exploring alternative methods of waste management to reduce landfill fires. Research institutions like I I T Kanpur are also actively engaged in developing cost-effective air purification technologies. Furthermore, the Graded Response Action Plan (G R A P), typically implemented in Delhi-N C R during peak pollution periods around Diwali (often around eighteen zero zero hours), aims to curtail polluting activities. Success hinges on a collaborative effort involving government bodies, industry, N G O s, and individual citizens. For example, a ban on firecrackers after twenty zero zero hours during Diwali might help in reducing immediate P M levels. Real-time air quality monitoring data (available from agencies like S A F A R-India) is also crucial for informing policy decisions and public awareness campaigns. On fifteenth august nineteen forty seven, we gained independence, but we are still striving for freedom from polluted air."}

Furthermore, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), typically implemented in Delhi-NCR during peak pollution periods around Diwali (often around 18:00 hrs), aims to curtail polluting activities. Success hinges on a collaborative effort involving government bodies, industry, NGOs, and individual citizens. For example, a ban on firecrackers after 22:00 hrs during Diwali might help in reducing immediate PM levels.
