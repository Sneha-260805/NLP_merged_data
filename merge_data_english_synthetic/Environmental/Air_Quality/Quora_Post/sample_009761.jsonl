Imagine the respiratory problems families face. In some ways, it's like a real-life \"Mother India\" scenario, where rural poverty necessitates practices that harm the environment and individual health. Addressing air quality requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological solutions, and individual responsibility.", "normalised": "Finally, let's not forget about indoor air pollution!
