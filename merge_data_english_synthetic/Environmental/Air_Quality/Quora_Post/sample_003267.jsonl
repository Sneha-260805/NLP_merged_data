{"unnormalised": "Air quality in many Indian cities, particularly Delhi, Mumbai, and Kanpur, has become a significant environmental concern. Several factors contribute to this issue. Vehicular emissions, driven by a rapidly growing number of cars and two-wheelers (often older models) are a major contributor. Construction activities, especially during peak seasons, generate substantial dust and particulate matter. Industrial emissions from factories located both within and outside city limits are another critical source. Agricultural practices, like stubble burning in states neighboring Delhi during October-November, drastically worsen air quality, blanketing the region in smog.", "normalised": "Air quality in many Indian cities, particularly Delhi, Mumbai, and Kanpur, has become a significant environmental concern.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, thermal power plants, many of which rely on coal, contribute significantly to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Unregulated waste burning also plays a role, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. The lack of stringent enforcement of environmental regulations, as highlighted in several reports by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), exacerbates the problem.", "normalised": "Furthermore, thermal power plants, many of which rely on coal, contribute significantly to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Mitigation strategies require a multi-pronged approach. Promoting public transport, phasing out older vehicles, and implementing stricter emission norms are crucial. Investing in cleaner energy sources and encouraging industries to adopt cleaner technologies are vital. Effective waste management strategies, including composting and recycling, can reduce waste burning. The \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\" needs to be scaled up significantly. We also need better enforcement of existing regulations.", "normalised": "Mitigation strategies require a multi-pronged approach.
