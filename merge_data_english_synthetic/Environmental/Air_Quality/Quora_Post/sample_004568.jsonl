{"unnormalised": "Vehicle emissions are a major culprit. The sheer volume of cars, buses, and trucks, many operating on older engines not compliant with Bharat Stage VI emission standards, releases substantial amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). Often, traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours around 09:00 hrs and again around 18:00 hrs, exacerbates the issue.", "normalised": "Vehicle emissions are a major culprit.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Strengthening and enforcing emission standards for vehicles and industries is crucial. Promoting public transportation, investing in electric vehicles, and improving infrastructure to reduce traffic congestion are essential. Encouraging sustainable agricultural practices and providing farmers with alternatives to crop burning is vital. Finally, enforcing stricter regulations on construction activities and implementing effective dust control measures are necessary. Perhaps, a study by IIT Delhi on 15/08/2023 can shine more light on the matter. Implementing these measures effectively will be challenging but vital for improving air quality for the 30 million residents of Delhi and surrounding areas. A review on progress should be done again on 26/01/2025.", "normalised": "Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-pronged approach.
