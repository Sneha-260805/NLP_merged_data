Think of the sheer number of cars, buses, and trucks on the streets of Mumbai, often running on older, less efficient engines. Replacing these with cleaner alternatives, like EVs or CNG, is crucial.", "normalised": "Firstly, vehicle emissions are a major culprit, especially in metropolitan areas.

The release of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) contributes to smog and respiratory problems. Proper regulation and enforcement are vital. Remember the tragedy from the 1984 Bhopal gas leak; we need to avoid such instances by prioritising safety and environmental responsibility.", "normalised": "Secondly, industrial pollution from factories and power plants is a significant issue.
