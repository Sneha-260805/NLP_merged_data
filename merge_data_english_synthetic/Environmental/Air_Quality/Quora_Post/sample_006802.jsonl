{"unnormalised": "Air quality in many Indian cities, particularly Delhi, has become a critical concern. Several factors contribute to this degradation, posing significant health risks to citizens.", "normalised": "Air quality in many Indian cities, particularly Delhi, has become a critical concern.

{"unnormalised": "One major culprit is vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of cars, buses, and two-wheelers, many running on older technologies and using adulterated fuel, releases copious amounts of pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). The shift to BS VI emission standards, implemented nationally on 01/04/2020, is a positive step, but its effectiveness depends on proper enforcement and phasing out of older vehicles.", "normalised": "One major culprit is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant contributor is industrial pollution. Factories operating in and around cities like Kanpur release untreated effluents and emissions, adding to the toxic air. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines are in place, but stringent monitoring and penalties are needed to ensure compliance. Furthermore, the burning of crop residue, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana post-harvest (around October-November each year), dramatically worsens air quality in Delhi NCR, sometimes reaching hazardous levels by 10:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Another significant contributor is industrial pollution.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India and state governments are implementing various measures, including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), promoting the use of CNG in public transport, encouraging electric vehicles through subsidies, and imposing bans on construction activities during peak pollution periods. However, a multi-pronged approach involving stricter regulations, public awareness campaigns, and sustainable practices is crucial for long-term improvement. Individual actions like using public transport, carpooling, and reducing burning of solid waste also play a vital role. We should aim for a cleaner Delhi by 15/08/2047, our centennial independence.", "normalised": "The Government of India and state governments are implementing various measures, including the National Clean Air Programme (N C A P), promoting the use of C N G in public transport, encouraging electric vehicles through subsidies, and imposing bans on construction activities during peak pollution periods.
