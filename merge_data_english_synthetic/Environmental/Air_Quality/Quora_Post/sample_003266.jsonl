{"unnormalised": "The deterioration of air quality is arguably one of the most critical environmental challenges confronting India in the 21st century. The pervasive smog in cities like Delhi, especially during the Diwali season around October-November, serves as a stark reminder of the severity of the problem.", "normalised": "The deterioration of air quality is arguably one of the most critical environmental challenges confronting India in the twenty first century.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to this alarming situation. Industrial emissions from factories located in areas like Ghaziabad and Faridabad release a cocktail of pollutants into the atmosphere. Vehicle emissions, particularly from older vehicles, are another significant contributor. The burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season, typically around March-April, exacerbates the problem significantly, blanketing the Indo-Gangetic plain in a hazardous haze.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to this alarming situation.

Stricter enforcement of emission norms for industries, promoting the adoption of electric vehicles, investing in cleaner transportation infrastructure like the Delhi Metro, and providing farmers with alternatives to stubble burning are all crucial steps. Public awareness campaigns, like the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,' can also play a vital role in promoting individual responsibility. The government’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched on 10/01/2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. Further advancements in air quality monitoring technology and real-time data dissemination, perhaps utilizing data science expertise from IIT Kanpur, are also essential for effective intervention at the local level, say, by 14:00 hrs on 01/05/2024. Ultimately, ensuring clean air for all citizens of India is not just an environmental imperative but also a fundamental human right, crucial for a healthy and prosperous future for generations to come. It's imperative to act now, before pollution reaches irreversible levels.", "normalised": "Addressing this crisis requires a multi-pronged approach.
