{"unnormalised": "Improving air quality in India presents a complex multi-faceted challenge. Rapid industrialization, burgeoning vehicular traffic, and agricultural practices, particularly crop burning in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season around late October/early November, contribute significantly to the problem. The infamous Delhi smog, often peaking after Diwali, is a stark reminder of the severity.", "normalised": "Improving air quality in India presents a complex multi-faceted challenge.

{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the sheer scale. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, addressing emissions from every sector requires enormous resources and concerted effort. Furthermore, enforcing environmental regulations can be difficult, especially in smaller industries operating with limited oversight. The legacy of pre-existing pollution, dating back to even before 15/08/1947, compounds the issue.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the sheer scale.

The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. Initiatives such as promoting electric vehicles (EVs), investing in public transport, and implementing stricter emission norms (like Bharat Stage VI) are underway.", "normalised": "However, sustainable solutions are gradually being implemented.

{"unnormalised": "Institutions like IIT Delhi are researching and developing innovative technologies to monitor and mitigate pollution. Stricter regulations on construction dust, often seen in bustling cities like Mumbai at 09:00 hrs, are also helping. While challenges remain, these initiatives offer a glimmer of hope for cleaner air in the future. We must work together, from policy makers in New Delhi to individual citizens, to achieve tangible improvements. The cost of inaction is far greater than any financial investment. A recent study estimates air pollution costs India Rs. 850 billion annually in healthcare expenses alone. There's a long way to go, but the journey towards cleaner air is crucial, especially for vulnerable populations. Think of the future for our children, we need cleaner air by Diwali 2025!", "normalised": "Institutions like I I T Delhi are researching and developing innovative technologies to monitor and mitigate pollution.
