{"unnormalised": "Firstly, vehicular emissions from old and poorly maintained vehicles contribute a significant amount of pollutants. Consider the bustling streets of Delhi, choked with traffic. Secondly, industrial emissions from factories and power plants, often lacking proper emission control technologies, release harmful gases into the atmosphere.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Strengthening emission control norms for vehicles and industries is vital. Promoting public transport and electric vehicles can reduce vehicular emissions. Encouraging farmers to adopt alternative methods of crop residue management, perhaps providing subsidies or training, is crucial. Implementing stricter regulations on construction activities to control dust pollution and promoting cleaner cooking fuels in rural areas are also essential steps.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, awareness campaigns educating the public about the dangers of air pollution and encouraging individual actions, like planting trees and using public transport, are vital. Even small changes, like choosing public transport to visit friends during Onam celebrations, can make a difference. Investing in air quality monitoring and forecasting systems, like SAFAR, helps inform the public and guide policy decisions. The air quality in our cities impacts everyone, from Ramesh in Kanpur to Sita in Chennai, and it's our collective responsibility to improve it.", "normalised": "Furthermore, awareness campaigns educating the public about the dangers of air pollution and encouraging individual actions, like planting trees and using public transport, are vital.
