{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant challenges stems from vehicular emissions. The sheer volume of vehicles, coupled with older, less fuel-efficient models, contributes substantially to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen oxide levels. The introduction of BS-VI emission standards was a step in the right direction, but enforcement and compliance remain crucial.", "normalised": "One of the most significant challenges stems from vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Innovative solutions are being explored, including the promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) through subsidies and infrastructure development. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is also researching more efficient and cleaner burning technologies. Efforts are also underway to promote alternative agricultural practices and provide farmers with incentives to avoid stubble burning. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 in identified cities.", "normalised": "Innovative solutions are being explored, including the promotion of electric vehicles, E Vs through subsidies and infrastructure development.
