{"unnormalised": "**What are the biggest contributors to poor air quality in India, and what can we do about it?**", "normalised": "Air quality in India, particularly in cities like Delhi and Kanpur, is a major environmental concern. Several factors contribute to this. One of the biggest is vehicular emissions. The sheer number of cars, buses, and two-wheelers, often older models with less efficient engines, pumping out exhaust fumes adds to the problem. Industrial emissions are another major culprit. Factories burning coal and other fossil fuels without adequate pollution control measures release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere."}

The burning of crop residue, especially after the kharif harvest in states like Punjab and Haryana, blankets the northern plains in a thick smog. Construction activities, with their dust and debris, further worsen the situation."}

Promoting electric vehicles and stricter enforcement of emission norms are crucial. Industries need to invest in cleaner technologies and adhere to pollution control standards. Encouraging farmers to adopt alternative methods to manage crop residue, like incorporating it back into the soil, is essential. Finally, individual actions like planting trees and using public transport can also make a difference. Remember that dialogue from three Idiots, “Kaabil bano, kaamyabi jhak maar ke peeche aayegi.” If we all strive to be responsible environmental stewards, we can definitely improve the air quality in our cities."}
