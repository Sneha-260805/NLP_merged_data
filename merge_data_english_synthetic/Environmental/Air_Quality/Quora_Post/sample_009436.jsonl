{"unnormalised": "Air quality in India is a significant environmental concern, impacting public health and the economy. The most pressing issues revolve around high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, particularly in densely populated urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.", "normalised": "Air quality in India is a significant environmental concern, impacting public health and the economy.

{"unnormalised": "Major sources of pollution include vehicular emissions, industrial activity (especially around Kanpur's leather tanneries), construction, agricultural burning (particularly in Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest around October-November), and domestic cooking using solid fuels. The impact is evident in increased respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and reduced life expectancy, with significant economic costs to the nation.", "normalised": "Major sources of pollution include vehicular emissions, industrial activity (especially around Kanpur's leather tanneries), construction, agricultural burning (particularly in Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest around October-November), and domestic cooking using solid fuels.

{"unnormalised": "Solutions are being implemented at various levels. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. Stricter emission norms for vehicles (Bharat Stage VI, implemented nationwide on 01/04/2020) and industries are being enforced. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR is actively monitoring and implementing measures during peak pollution periods, such as construction bans and restrictions on vehicle entry.", "normalised": "Solutions are being implemented at various levels. The National Clean Air Programme (N C A P), launched in two thousand and nineteen, aims to reduce P M two point five and P M ten concentrations by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four, using two thousand and seventeen as the base year. Stricter emission norms for vehicles (Bharat Stage six, implemented nationwide on first april two thousand and twenty) and industries are being enforced.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of cleaner cooking fuels under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), and investing in public transportation are also crucial long-term strategies. Initiatives by organizations like the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in creating awareness and advocating for policy changes are also significant. Furthermore, research institutions like IIT Delhi are actively involved in developing and deploying air quality monitoring technologies and data analysis. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted effort from the government, industry, and citizens, starting from individual actions like reducing personal vehicle usage to supporting policies that promote cleaner air. Action is crucial before the air becomes unbearable by 10:00 hrs in winter.", "normalised": "The adoption of cleaner cooking fuels under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, promoting electric vehicles (E V s), and investing in public transportation are also crucial long-term strategies.
