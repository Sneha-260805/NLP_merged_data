{"unnormalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) is doing great work in air quality forecasting, but we need more robust enforcement of environmental regulations, investment in cleaner technologies, and increased public awareness. Remember that scene in the Bollywood movie \"Delhi 6\" showcasing the smog? It's a reflection of the reality we face and must address. Solutions require government policies, individual responsibility, and investment in cleaner alternatives, like solar energy. The Air Quality Index (AQI) needs to be readily accessible and easily understood by the public to encourage informed decision-making. We need solutions implemented from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to ensure all are breathing clean air.", "normalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach.
