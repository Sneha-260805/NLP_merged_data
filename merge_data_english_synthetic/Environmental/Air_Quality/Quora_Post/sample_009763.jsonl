{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe. High pollutant levels, often due to industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural practices like stubble burning, can have serious health consequences. Think respiratory problems, heart disease, and even increased cancer risk.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe.
