We often think of smog as a winter problem thanks to stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab, but industrial emissions and vehicular traffic are year-round contributors.

Also, maybe planting more trees? Even a small garden in your balcony helps. The government also needs to crack down on polluting industries and enforce stricter emission norms.
