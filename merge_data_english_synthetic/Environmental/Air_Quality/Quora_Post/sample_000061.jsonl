{"unnormalised": "Understanding the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial. It's a scale that tells you how clean or polluted the air is, with numbers corresponding to health risks. For example, an AQI above 300 in Delhi around Diwali (14/11/2020) signals hazardous air quality.", "normalised": "Understanding the Air Quality Index (A Q I) is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Individual actions include using public transport, carpooling, and planting trees. At the governmental level, policies promoting cleaner fuels (like CNG), stricter emission norms (BS VI implemented from 01/04/2020), and investment in renewable energy are essential. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year.", "normalised": "What can be done?
