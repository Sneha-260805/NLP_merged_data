{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to this issue. Vehicular emissions are a primary culprit. Older vehicles, particularly those not adhering to BS VI emission standards implemented in 2020, release substantial pollutants. Industrial activity, especially in areas like Delhi-NCR and around Kanpur, discharges harmful particulate matter and gases. Construction dust from ongoing infrastructure projects adds to the problem, especially during peak construction season. Agricultural practices such as stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana post-harvest (around October-November each year) create severe smog conditions across North India.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to this issue.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach. Transitioning to cleaner fuels, enforcing emission standards more rigorously, investing in public transportation, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), and adopting dust control measures at construction sites are crucial. Stricter regulations on industrial emissions and incentivizing sustainable agricultural practices, like alternatives to stubble burning offered by institutions such as IARI (Indian Agricultural Research Institute), are also necessary. Public awareness campaigns, like the one run by the Delhi government at 11:00 hrs on 01/01/2023 urging residents to carpool, are essential for driving behavioral changes. A long-term commitment and collaborative efforts are required to ensure a healthier and sustainable environment for all. PM2.5 levels in Delhi during Diwali (12/11/2023) typically peak, highlighting the need for stricter enforcement during festivals. The estimated cost of health impacts due to air pollution in India reaches thousands of crores (Rs.), necessitating urgent action.", "normalised": "Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach.
