The challenges are multifaceted and require comprehensive solutions.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing issues is the alarming level of particulate matter, particularly P M two point five and P M ten, in major urban centers like Delhi, Kanpur, and Kolkata. These fine particles, often originating from vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction, contribute to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and even premature deaths. Data from fourteenth january two thousand and twenty four revealed A Q I levels consistently exceeding permissible limits in many Indian cities."}

This practice releases massive quantities of smoke and pollutants, exacerbating air pollution in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

This includes stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries, promoting cleaner fuels like C N G and electric vehicles, investing in public transportation infrastructure, and implementing effective dust control measures at construction sites. Additionally, incentivizing farmers to adopt alternative stubble management practices, such as using bio-decomposers like Pusa Decomposer developed by I A R I (Indian Agricultural Research Institute), is crucial. Awareness campaigns, like the ones started by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on fifth june two thousand and twenty three (World Environment Day), are essential to educate the public about the risks of air pollution and encourage responsible behavior. Collaboration between government agencies, industries, and citizens is paramount to achieving tangible improvements in air quality. We must act decisively to ensure a healthier future for generations to come."}
