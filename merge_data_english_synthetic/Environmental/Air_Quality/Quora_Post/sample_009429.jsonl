Several factors contribute to this issue, making it a complex problem requiring multi-pronged solutions.", "normalised": "The air quality in Delhi, and indeed many parts of India, has been a persistent concern, especially during the winter months.

{"unnormalised": "A primary culprit is vehicular emissions. The sheer number of vehicles on Delhi's roads, often older models with less stringent emission standards, releases substantial amounts of pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. Industrial activity, especially in surrounding areas like Faridabad and Ghaziabad, contributes significantly as well. Many factories still rely on older technologies and less clean fuels, emitting pollutants into the atmosphere.", "normalised": "A primary culprit is vehicular emissions.

{"unnormalised": "Another major factor, particularly during October-November, is stubble burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab. Farmers often burn crop residue after harvesting to prepare fields for the next sowing season, releasing massive amounts of smoke that travels to Delhi. Construction activities, especially with the rapid pace of development, generate dust and particulate matter. Finally, meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversions during winter, trap pollutants near the ground, exacerbating the problem.", "normalised": "Another major factor, particularly during October slash November, is stubble burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab.

{"unnormalised": "The government has initiated several measures to combat air pollution. These include the introduction of Bharat Stage VI emission norms for vehicles, promoting the use of cleaner fuels like CNG and electricity in public transport, and implementing odd-even schemes to reduce traffic congestion. The Supreme Court has also intervened, issuing directives to curb stubble burning and regulate construction activities. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. The \"Grades Response Action Plan (GRAP)\" is enforced based on the air quality Index (AQI) readings recorded at 09:00 hrs daily. Air quality is often particularly bad around Diwali, usually observed around the 24/10, due to the bursting of firecrackers. However, achieving sustained improvements requires consistent enforcement, technological advancements, and public awareness campaigns. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, Delhi, has noted a spike in respiratory illnesses correlated with these periods of poor air quality.", "normalised": "The government has initiated several measures to combat air pollution.
