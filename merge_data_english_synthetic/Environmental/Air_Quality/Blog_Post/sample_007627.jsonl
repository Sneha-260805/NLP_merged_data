{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) to gases like ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). High concentrations of these pollutants can have serious consequences for our health, ranging from respiratory problems like asthma to cardiovascular diseases and even cancer.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten) to gases like ozone (O three), nitrogen dioxide (N O two), and sulphur dioxide (S O two).

{"unnormalised": "In India, air quality is a significant concern in many urban centers like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Factors contributing to poor air quality include vehicle emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and burning of agricultural residue, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest. The CSE (Centre for Science and Environment) has been a vocal advocate for cleaner air in India for many years, highlighting the link between pollution levels and public health crises.", "normalised": "In India, air quality is a significant concern in many urban centers like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "The National Air Quality Index (AQI) is a useful tool developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to communicate air quality information to the public in an easily understandable way. It uses a color-coded system and numerical values to indicate the level of air pollution, from \"Good\" to \"Severe.\" Checking the AQI in your area regularly, perhaps via a mobile app or news source, can help you make informed decisions about outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.", "normalised": "The National Air Quality Index (A Q I) is a useful tool developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) to communicate air quality information to the public in an easily understandable way.

As individuals, we can adopt more sustainable transportation options like public transport or cycling (if feasible and safe, considering local conditions), reduce energy consumption at home, and support policies aimed at improving air quality. On a larger scale, initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (using 2017 as the base year).", "normalised": "What can we do?

{"unnormalised": "While the problem is complex, with collaborative efforts from individuals, communities, and governments, we can work towards cleaner air for a healthier future for everyone, from the bustling streets of Old Delhi to the serene backwaters of Kerala. Remember, even small actions, like planting trees in your community or ensuring your home has adequate ventilation in a 1000 sq ft area, can contribute to a positive change. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS is conducting research on the long-term health effects of air pollution, and his findings highlight the urgency of the situation. The estimated cost of pollution-related illnesses is in the Rs. 1000s of crores annually, emphasizing the economic burden as well. Let's strive for a future where breathing clean air is not a luxury, but a fundamental right.", "normalised": "While the problem is complex, with collaborative efforts from individuals, communities, and governments, we can work towards cleaner air for a healthier future for everyone, from the bustling streets of Old Delhi to the serene backwaters of Kerala.
