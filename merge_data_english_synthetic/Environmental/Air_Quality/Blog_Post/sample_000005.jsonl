{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the presence of pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO), among others. Each of these has different sources, from vehicle emissions and industrial processes to agricultural burning and even construction.", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the presence of pollutants in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "Why is this a problem? Poor air quality is directly linked to a range of health issues, especially respiratory illnesses. Think asthma, bronchitis, and even increased risk of heart disease and cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Remember the smog blankets that engulf Delhi every winter? It’s a stark reminder of the impact.", "normalised": "Why is this a problem? Poor air quality is directly linked to a range of health issues, especially respiratory illnesses.

The burning of crop residue after harvest, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana around Diwali time, is a major source of PM2.5.", "normalised": "India faces unique challenges.

{"unnormalised": "What is being done? The Indian government, along with organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is working on various initiatives to improve air quality. These include the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 in identified cities. Regulations on vehicle emissions (Bharat Stage VI standards) are also playing a role. IIT Kanpur is actively involved in research and development of solutions for air pollution monitoring and mitigation.", "normalised": "What is being done?

{"unnormalised": "So, what can you do? Be aware of the air quality index (AQI) in your city. Reduce your reliance on personal vehicles; opt for public transport, cycling, or walking whenever possible. Support policies that promote cleaner energy and sustainable practices. Small changes can make a big difference. Check air quality data often – usually readings update hourly, say around 09:00 hrs. And finally, consider planting trees – a simple yet effective way to improve air quality around your home. Even simple acts, like avoiding burning waste on 26/01/2024 (Republic Day), contribute to a cleaner environment. Let's work together to ensure that everyone in India can breathe easy.", "normalised": "So, what can you do? Be aware of the air quality index (A Q I) in your city.
