{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants, which can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) to gases like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), can have serious impacts on our health and the environment. Dr. Sharma, a leading pulmonologist at AIIMS, Delhi, has repeatedly warned about the correlation between poor air quality and respiratory illnesses.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "The sources of air pollution are diverse. In urban areas, vehicle emissions are a major culprit. Industrial activity, particularly around cities like Kanpur, also contributes significantly. Agricultural practices, like stubble burning prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest, release immense amounts of smoke into the atmosphere, impacting air quality as far as 300 km away. Construction activities, with dust flying around newly constructed buildings covering thousands of sq ft, add to the problem too.", "normalised": "The sources of air pollution are diverse.

{"unnormalised": "Measuring air quality is typically done using an Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI provides a single number that represents the overall air quality at a specific location. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered \"Good,\" while an AQI above 300 is considered \"Hazardous.\" You can often find AQI data for your city on websites of organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).", "normalised": "Measuring air quality is typically done using an Air Quality Index (A Q I).

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of poor air quality is also substantial. Healthcare costs rise due to respiratory illnesses, and productivity suffers. Cleaning up our air will require a concerted effort from individuals, industries, and the government. We need stronger enforcement of environmental regulations, investments in cleaner technologies, and a greater awareness of the problem among the general public. Perhaps a 'Swachh Hawa Abhiyan' (Clean Air Campaign), mirroring the success of the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' (Clean India Mission), could be beneficial. Ignoring air pollution is costing us, in Rs. and in lives.", "normalised": "The economic impact of poor air quality is also substantial.
