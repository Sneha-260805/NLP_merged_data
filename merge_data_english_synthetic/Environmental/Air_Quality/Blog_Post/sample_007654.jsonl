{"unnormalised": "What exactly is air quality? Simply put, it's a measure of how clean or polluted the air is. The presence of pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) all contribute to poor air quality. These pollutants are often measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3).", "normalised": "What exactly is air quality? Simply put, it's a measure of how clean or polluted the air is.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to India's air quality challenges. Industrial emissions from factories in areas like Gujarat, vehicular exhaust especially from older vehicles, construction dust (think all those sq ft of new buildings going up!), agricultural burning after harvest season (common in Punjab and Haryana), and even household cooking with solid fuels all play a significant role. The burning of crackers during Diwali, although a joyful occasion, also significantly degrades air quality in the days following the festival.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to India's air quality challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in India monitor air quality across the country and provide data through the National Air Quality Index (AQI). An AQI value of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is considered \"Hazardous.\" Unfortunately, many Indian cities routinely experience AQI values in the \"Poor\" to \"Severe\" range.", "normalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) in India monitor air quality across the country and provide data through the National Air Quality Index (A Q I).

{"unnormalised": "Poor air quality can have serious health consequences. It can worsen respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, contribute to heart disease, and even increase the risk of lung cancer. Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Dr. Gupta, a renowned pulmonologist at AIIMS, Delhi, regularly emphasizes the link between air pollution and respiratory ailments in his research.", "normalised": "Poor air quality can have serious health consequences.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Solutions range from individual actions like using public transport or cycling to work, to government policies promoting cleaner fuels and stricter emission standards for vehicles and industries. Investing in renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable agricultural practices are also crucial steps. For example, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) implemented in Delhi-NCR aims to combat pollution by taking steps like banning construction activities based on the AQI levels. Small changes like planting more trees (think of the green cover initiative in Bangalore) can also make a difference. Even contributing Rs. 100 to afforestation efforts can help. Let's work together to ensure that everyone in India can breathe clean air.", "normalised": "What can be done?
