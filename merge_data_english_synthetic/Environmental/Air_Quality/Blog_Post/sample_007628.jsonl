{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how polluted the air we breathe is. Poor air quality is a cocktail of harmful substances like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These pollutants can come from various sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction, and even burning agricultural waste, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how polluted the air we breathe is.

{"unnormalised": "Cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Varanasi often top global lists for poor air quality, making headlines for their hazardous air quality index (AQI) levels. Dr. Sharma from AIIMS Delhi, a leading pulmonologist, constantly highlights the correlation between poor air quality and respiratory illnesses, especially amongst children and the elderly. Research has shown that prolonged exposure can lead to asthma, bronchitis, and even increase the risk of heart disease.", "normalised": "Cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Varanasi often top global lists for poor air quality, making headlines for their hazardous air quality index (A Q I) levels.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? The answer lies in a multi-pronged approach. Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. These initiatives involve promoting cleaner fuels, improving public transport, enforcing stricter emission norms for industries, and implementing dust control measures at construction sites (requiring covering of construction sites larger than 500 sq ft).", "normalised": "What can be done?

{"unnormalised": "Individual actions also matter. We can opt for public transport, carpool, cycle, or walk whenever possible. Planting trees helps filter the air, and supporting initiatives that promote sustainable practices can contribute to long-term improvements. Even small changes, like properly disposing of waste and avoiding burning it, can make a difference. Rs. 50 saved by burning trash isn't worth the long-term cost to our health.", "normalised": "Individual actions also matter.
