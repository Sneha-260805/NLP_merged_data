{"unnormalised": "The sources are varied, honestly. Vehicle emissions are a big culprit, especially in bustling metros like Chennai. Then there's industrial pollution from factories churning out stuff in places like Ludhiana. Agricultural burning, especially after the harvest season in Punjab and Haryana, contributes significantly too. And let’s not forget those dusty construction sites – dust particles are a major air pollutant. Even burning wood for cooking in some rural areas contributes to the problem.", "normalised": "The sources are varied, honestly.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, the government is taking steps. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched a while back, aims to reduce particulate matter concentrations significantly. They’re looking at things like stricter emission norms for vehicles (Bharat Stage VI, anyone?), promoting public transport, and trying to control industrial emissions. The IITs, like IIT Kanpur, are also doing some cool research on air pollution monitoring and mitigation.", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Well, the government is taking steps.

{"unnormalised": "Remember that landmark date, 15/08/1947, when India gained independence? Let's strive to achieve independence from polluted air too. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) releases regular air quality indices, so keep an eye on those. Many areas report very unhealthy levels at times like 17:00 hrs or during peak traffic at 09:00 hrs in the morning. It’s a long road, but even small changes, like switching to CNG autorickshaws, or advocating for more green spaces in our cities, like those around the Ganga, can make a difference.
