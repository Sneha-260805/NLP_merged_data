{"unnormalised": "Air quality, a subject often discussed but perhaps not fully understood, refers to the condition of the air around us. It’s a crucial aspect of our environment that directly impacts our health and well-being.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality. Industrial emissions from factories in areas like Faridabad release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Vehicular traffic, especially older vehicles that don't adhere to BS VI emission standards, also contributes significantly. Construction activities generate dust, further degrading the air. Even agricultural practices like stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, though seasonal, have a devastating impact on air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plain, leading to the infamous Delhi smog.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitors air quality across India, using measures like the Air Quality Index (AQI). This index assigns a number to the air quality, ranging from \"Good\" to \"Severe,\" helping citizens understand the health risks associated with the current air. An AQI above 300 is considered very unhealthy.", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) monitors air quality across India, using measures like the Air Quality Index (A Q I).

Opting for public transport, carpooling, using bicycles, and planting trees are all effective strategies. Investing in air purifiers for homes and offices, particularly for those living in high-pollution zones, can help improve indoor air quality within a limited sq ft. Supporting policies aimed at promoting cleaner energy and reducing industrial emissions is also crucial.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

Protecting our environment, even in small measures like reducing waste to cut down on landfill emissions, is key to ensuring a healthy future for generations to come. After all, what is Rs. 100 spent on planting a tree compared to a lifetime of medical bills caused by breathing polluted air? Let's work together to create a breathable India.", "normalised": "Ultimately, improving air quality requires a concerted effort from individuals, industries, and the government.
