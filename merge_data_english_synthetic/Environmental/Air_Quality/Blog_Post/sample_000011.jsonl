{"unnormalised": "The primary culprits behind deteriorating air quality are multifaceted. Industrial emissions from factories in regions like Maharashtra, vehicular exhaust in metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, and agricultural practices like stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana contribute significantly. Construction activities and dust storms, particularly in Rajasthan, further exacerbate the problem.", "normalised": "The primary culprits behind deteriorating air quality are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels often exceed permissible limits in several Indian cities. These microscopic particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, leading to various health issues, including asthma, bronchitis, and even cardiovascular diseases. Studies have also linked prolonged exposure to air pollution with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, a significant concern in the context of recent global pandemics.", "normalised": "According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B), particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten) levels often exceed permissible limits in several Indian cities.
