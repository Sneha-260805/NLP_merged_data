{"unnormalised": "According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), air pollution levels in many Indian cities far exceed the permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is primarily attributed to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and the burning of crop residue, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvesting season. The infamous Delhi smog during Diwali, often exacerbated by firecracker emissions, serves as a stark reminder of the urgency of the situation.", "normalised": "According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (C S E), air pollution levels in many Indian cities far exceed the permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (W H O).

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching. Studies conducted by Dr. Sharma at AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) have linked prolonged exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Furthermore, the economic burden of air pollution is substantial, with increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity. A recent study estimated that air pollution costs India Rs. 5.85 lakh crore annually.", "normalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "The government, along with various NGOs, is implementing measures to combat air pollution. These include promoting the use of electric vehicles, implementing stricter emission norms for industries, encouraging the adoption of cleaner cooking fuels, and investing in public transportation infrastructure. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. However, more needs to be done to effectively address this complex issue.", "normalised": "The government, along with various N G O’s, is implementing measures to combat air pollution.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing the air quality crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological innovations, and community participation. Ensuring clean air for all is not just an environmental imperative; it is a fundamental human right. A family living in a 500 sq ft apartment in a heavily polluted area of Kolkata deserves to breathe clean air just as much as anyone else. The future of India's health and prosperity depends on our collective commitment to tackling this challenge head-on.", "normalised": "Addressing the air quality crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government policies, technological innovations, and community participation.
