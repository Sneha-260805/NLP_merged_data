{"unnormalised": "Air quality, or the lack thereof, has emerged as a pressing environmental concern across India. From the bustling streets of Delhi to the serene hills of Himachal Pradesh, the impact of air pollution is felt nationwide. Dr. Meena Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, emphasizes that the current levels of particulate matter, especially PM2.5, pose a significant risk to public health.", "normalised": "Air quality, or the lack thereof, has emerged as a pressing environmental concern across India.

{"unnormalised": "The sources of air pollution are varied and complex. Industrial emissions from factories in areas like Faridabad contribute heavily, as do vehicular exhaust fumes, particularly in metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Chennai. Construction activities, often unregulated, raise dust levels considerably. Burning of crop residue, a common practice in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season, further exacerbates the problem, blanketing the northern plains in a noxious haze.", "normalised": "The sources of air pollution are varied and complex.

{"unnormalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching. Respiratory illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis are on the rise, and long-term exposure has been linked to cardiovascular diseases and even certain cancers. The economic impact is also substantial, with increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity. A recent study estimated that air pollution costs India Rs. 5.8 trillion annually.", "normalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce air pollution levels by 20-30% by 2024. However, successful implementation requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter emission norms for industries, promotion of electric vehicles, improved public transportation systems, and widespread public awareness campaigns.", "normalised": "Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (N C A P) aim to reduce air pollution levels by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, innovative solutions are needed to tackle specific regional challenges. For instance, promoting the use of happy seeders to manage crop residue can significantly reduce stubble burning. Investing in green infrastructure, such as urban forests and green roofs (covering rooftops with vegetation) can improve air quality locally in cities offering approximately 1000 sq ft of green space per building.", "normalised": "Furthermore, innovative solutions are needed to tackle specific regional challenges. For instance, promoting the use of happy seeders to manage crop residue can significantly reduce stubble burning. Investing in green infrastructure, such as urban forests and green roofs (covering rooftops with vegetation) can improve air quality locally in cities offering approximately one thousand square feet of green space per building."}
{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, ensuring clean air for all Indians requires a collective effort. From individual actions like using public transport and planting trees to policy-level interventions by the government, every contribution counts towards breathing easier in the 'land of the pure'. The air quality index, which many Indian cities now display prominently, is a constant reminder of the urgency of this environmental challenge.", "normalised": "Ultimately, ensuring clean air for all Indians requires a collective effort.
