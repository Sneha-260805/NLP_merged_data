{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted. Pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are commonly monitored. These pollutants, often released from vehicles, industries, and agricultural practices (like stubble burning, a common issue in Punjab), can have severe impacts on our health.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: cities like Kanpur, ranked amongst the most polluted globally at times, struggle with respiratory illnesses. From children to the elderly, poor air quality exacerbates conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and even increases the risk of heart disease.

{"unnormalised": "In India, understanding the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial. The AQI is a single number used to represent the overall air quality in a particular location. It translates complex air quality data into easily understandable categories: Good, Satisfactory, Moderately Polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitors air quality across the country and provides real-time data. You can often find this information online or even on roadside displays in some cities.", "normalised": "In India, understanding the Air Quality Index (A Q I) is crucial.
