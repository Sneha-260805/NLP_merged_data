They said the AQI was hovering around 450 at 10:00 hrs - officially “hazardous.” Made me think twice about taking that morning walk!", "normalised": "We've all seen the smog hanging over Delhi during Diwali, right?

All those cars, bikes, and auto-rickshaws chugging along, especially in cities like Bangalore, spew out a cocktail of pollutants.

Institutions like IIT Delhi are also working on innovative solutions to monitor and mitigate pollution. But it takes more than just government action. We all have a role to play. Carpooling, using public transport, planting trees (think of the banyan trees our grandfathers planted!), and supporting sustainable practices are all steps in the right direction.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
