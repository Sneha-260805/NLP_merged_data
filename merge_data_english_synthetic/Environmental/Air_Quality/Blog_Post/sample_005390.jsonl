{"unnormalised": "Air quality. It's a phrase we hear often, especially during the winter months in North India, but what does it really mean? Air quality refers to the degree to which the air is free from pollutants, like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. When these pollutants are present in high concentrations, the air is considered unhealthy, posing significant risks to human health and the environment.", "normalised": "Air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Think of Delhi, for example. Every year, after Diwali, the air quality index (AQI) often skyrockets, turning the sky a hazy grey. This isn't just an aesthetic issue; it's a public health crisis. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS has repeatedly highlighted the link between poor air quality and respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and even cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.", "normalised": "Think of Delhi, for example.

{"unnormalised": "So, what are these pollutants and where do they come from? PM2.5, for instance, refers to fine inhalable particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less. These tiny particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Common sources include vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and the burning of crop residue (like in Haryana and Punjab after the rice harvest). Burning garbage also contributes significantly.", "normalised": "So, what are these pollutants and where do they come from?

{"unnormalised": "The AQI is a tool used to measure and report air quality on a scale of 0 to 500+, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is considered \"Hazardous.\" Cities like Kanpur and Varanasi also face similar challenges, struggling with high levels of pollution due to industrial activity and population density.", "normalised": "The A Q I is a tool used to measure and report air quality on a scale of zero to five hundred plus, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Individual actions like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (even in a small 100 sq ft area), and avoiding burning anything can make a difference. Supporting policies that promote cleaner energy sources and stricter emission standards is also crucial. Institutions like IIT Delhi are working on innovative solutions, from air purifiers to better waste management systems. Remember, breathing clean air is a fundamental right. It’s not just about the Rs. we spend on air purifiers; it's about creating a sustainable future for everyone, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. The cost of inaction is far greater.", "normalised": "What can we do?
