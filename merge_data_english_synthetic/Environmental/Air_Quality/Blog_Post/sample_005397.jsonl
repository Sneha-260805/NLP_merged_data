{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the degree to which the air is free from pollutants. These pollutants can be both natural (like dust storms) and human-caused (like emissions from vehicles and factories). Common pollutants include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Exposure to these pollutants can lead to a range of health problems, from respiratory illnesses like asthma to heart disease and even cancer.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the degree to which the air is free from pollutants. These pollutants can be both natural (like dust storms) and human-caused (like emissions from vehicles and factories). Common pollutants include particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide (N O two), and sulfur dioxide (S O two).

{"unnormalised": "In India, the National Air Quality Index (AQI) is used to measure air quality. It uses a color-coded system, ranging from \"Good\" (green) to \"Severe\" (red) to represent the level of pollution. Cities like Delhi and Kanpur often experience \"Poor\" or \"Very Poor\" air quality, particularly during the winter months. This is often due to a combination of factors including vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, construction activities, and agricultural burning, especially after the Diwali festival.", "normalised": "In India, the National Air Quality Index (A Q I) is used to measure air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, has conducted extensive research on the impact of air pollution on children's health. His studies show a direct correlation between high PM2.5 levels and increased respiratory infections in children living in areas with poor air quality. He recommends using air purifiers in homes and schools, especially in areas with high pollution levels. A decent air purifier can cover an area of around 500 sq ft.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma from the Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Delhi, has conducted extensive research on the impact of air pollution on children's health.

{"unnormalised": "The government is taking steps to improve air quality, including promoting cleaner fuels, implementing stricter emission standards for vehicles, and investing in public transportation.

{"unnormalised": "As individuals, we can also contribute to cleaner air. This includes using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (especially native species like the Neem tree), and avoiding burning waste. Remember, breathing clean air is a fundamental right, and it requires collective effort to achieve. Let's strive for a future where everyone in India can breathe easy, without having to worry about the air they are inhaling. The cost of clean air is much less than the Rs. spent on healthcare for pollution related illness. Even small steps can make a big difference for future generations and for the well being of communities stretching hundreds of km.", "normalised": "As individuals, we can also contribute to cleaner air.
