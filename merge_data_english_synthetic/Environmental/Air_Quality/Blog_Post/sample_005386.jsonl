{"unnormalised": "What exactly *is* air quality? Simply put, it refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air. These pollutants, often invisible to the naked eye, include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Sources vary, ranging from vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust (think of the endless construction in Mumbai!), to even burning agricultural residue, a common practice in states like Punjab after the harvest season.", "normalised": "What exactly *is* air quality?

{"unnormalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching. Dr. Sharma, a pulmonologist at AIIMS, New Delhi, often sees patients with respiratory issues exacerbated by high pollution levels. Increased instances of asthma, bronchitis, and even cardiovascular diseases are linked to long-term exposure to polluted air. Children are particularly vulnerable, their developing lungs more susceptible to damage.", "normalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Monitoring air quality is done through various methods. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) maintains a network of monitoring stations across the country, providing real-time data to the public. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a simplified metric that translates complex data into an easy-to-understand number, ranging from \"Good\" to \"Hazardous.\" If the AQI is high, it's advisable to limit outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "Monitoring air quality is done through various methods.

{"unnormalised": "What can *we* do? While large-scale solutions involving government policies and industrial regulations are essential, individual actions can also make a difference. Using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (even a small garden in your 100 sq ft balcony!), and supporting eco-friendly practices are all steps in the right direction. Remember the Diwali celebrations? Opt for eco-friendly crackers to minimize air pollution, even if it costs you Rs. 500 more. Every little bit helps. Protecting our air is an investment in our health and the future of generations to come, from the ghats of Varanasi to the tea gardens of Assam.", "normalised": "What can *we* do?
