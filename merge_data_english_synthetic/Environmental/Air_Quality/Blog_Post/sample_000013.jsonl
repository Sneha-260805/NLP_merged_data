{"unnormalised": "Air quality, or the lack thereof, is a pressing environmental concern demanding urgent attention, particularly in densely populated nations like India. The air we breathe, often taken for granted, directly impacts our health and well-being, influencing everything from respiratory function to cardiovascular health. Monitoring and understanding air quality indices are crucial for informed decision-making and implementing effective mitigation strategies.", "normalised": "Air quality, or the lack thereof, is a pressing environmental concern demanding urgent attention, particularly in densely populated nations like India.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) plays a vital role in monitoring air quality across major Indian cities. Their data, collected from numerous monitoring stations nationwide, reveals that many urban centers frequently exceed permissible levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This grim reality stems from a complex interplay of factors including vehicular emissions, industrial activity, construction dust, and agricultural practices like stubble burning, particularly prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana during the post-harvest season.", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) plays a vital role in monitoring air quality across major Indian cities.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching. Beyond the obvious respiratory ailments, studies from institutions like AIIMS, New Delhi, have linked chronic exposure to air pollution with increased risks of heart disease, stroke, and even certain cancers. Children are particularly vulnerable, experiencing impaired lung development and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The economic burden is also substantial, with healthcare costs escalating and productivity declining due to pollution-related illnesses.", "normalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching.

While fictionalized, it offers a chilling glimpse of the potential consequences of unchecked environmental degradation. Just as Akshay Kumar's character orchestrated a massive evacuation, we need a concerted effort to \"evacuate\" our cities from the clutches of air pollution. Citizens can play a role by opting for public transport, adopting cleaner energy sources, and advocating for policies that prioritize environmental sustainability. The fight for clean air is a fight for a healthier future for all.", "normalised": "Remember the smog-filled landscape depicted in the Bollywood film, \"Airlift\"?
