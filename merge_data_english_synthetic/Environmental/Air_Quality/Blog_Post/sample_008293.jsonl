{"unnormalised": "We’re talking about everything from the tiny PM2.5 particles – so small they can burrow deep into your lungs – to ozone, carbon monoxide, and other nasties. Sources? Well, think vehicles belching smoke (especially those old autos!), construction dust kicking up everywhere, industrial emissions, and, of course, the infamous stubble burning that happens around Diwali time. I remember reading a report from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) mentioning dangerously high levels around 25/10/2023 during that period.

Supporting initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by the MoEFCC, is also crucial. We also need to hold industries and authorities accountable. Are they implementing emission control measures properly? Is the monitoring accurate and transparent?", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

Institutions like IIT Kanpur are also working on innovative solutions to combat pollution. But there's still a long way to go. Let's pledge to be more conscious about our actions and demand cleaner air for ourselves and future generations. After all, breathing clean air isn't a luxury, it's a basic human right, due by say, 31/12/2024, wouldn’t you agree? And that's something worth fighting for, right, Ram bhai?", "normalised": "The good news is, awareness is growing.
