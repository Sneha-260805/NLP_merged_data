{"unnormalised": "Air quality. We hear about it on news channels, read about it in newspapers, especially around Diwali in Delhi and other North Indian cities. But what does it really mean? Simply put, air quality refers to the condition of the air around us, particularly its purity and the presence (or absence) of pollutants. Poor air quality can have serious health consequences, affecting everything from our respiratory system to our cardiovascular health.", "normalised": "Air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Industrial emissions from factories in places like Gujarat, vehicular exhaust fumes in bustling metropolises such as Mumbai, agricultural burning, and construction activities all release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. These pollutants include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "PM2.5, for example, refers to fine inhalable particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less. These tiny particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing serious health problems. The permissible limit for PM2.5 in India, according to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), is 40 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) on an annual average basis. Sadly, many Indian cities regularly exceed this limit.", "normalised": "P M two point five, for example, refers to fine inhalable particles with diameters of two point five micrometers or less.

{"unnormalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and institutions like IIT Delhi are actively involved in monitoring air quality and conducting research to understand the sources and impacts of pollution. They publish daily air quality indices (AQI) for major cities, which give us a snapshot of the air we're breathing. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while an AQI of 301-400 is considered \"Very Poor.\"", "normalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) and institutions like I I T Delhi are actively involved in monitoring air quality and conducting research to understand the sources and impacts of pollution.

Using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (even a small Tulsi plant in your 100 sq ft balcony!), and reducing our reliance on private vehicles are all steps in the right direction. Supporting policies that promote cleaner energy and stricter emission standards for industries is also crucial. Dr. Sharma, a renowned environmental scientist, often emphasizes the importance of citizen participation in tackling air pollution.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
