{"unnormalised": "Air quality. It's a term we hear often, especially in cities like Delhi and Kanpur, but do we truly understand what it means and how it affects us? Let's break it down. Air quality essentially refers to the degree to which the air is clean, clear, and free from pollutants. Poor air quality, often visually represented by that familiar smoggy haze during Diwali or winter months, is detrimental to our health and the environment.", "normalised": "Air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit, particularly in densely populated urban centres. Industrial activities, especially those lacking proper emission controls, release harmful gases and particulate matter. Agricultural practices like stubble burning, prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana, contribute significantly to air pollution spikes after the monsoon. Construction dust and even household activities like burning firewood in chulhas (traditional stoves) also play a role.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "So, how is air quality measured? We use the Air Quality Index (AQI). This index assigns a numerical value to air quality based on the concentration of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is categorized as \"Hazardous.\" For instance, during the smog season, AQI levels in Delhi often soar past 400, triggering health advisories.", "normalised": "So, how is air quality measured?

Their research helps policymakers formulate effective strategies to combat pollution.", "normalised": "Institutions like the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (I I T M), Pune, play a crucial role in monitoring and predicting air quality.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of poor air quality is far-reaching. Respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis become more prevalent. Long-term exposure can lead to heart disease and even cancer. Remember the poignant scene in the Bollywood film \"Airlift\" where Akshay Kumar's character highlights the dangers of the polluted Kuwaiti air during the invasion? While fictional, it underscores the serious consequences of breathing toxic air. Addressing air quality is a collective responsibility. We can all contribute by using public transportation, carpooling, planting trees, and advocating for stricter environmental regulations. The health of our nation, from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene backwaters of Kerala, depends on it.", "normalised": "The impact of poor air quality is far-reaching.
