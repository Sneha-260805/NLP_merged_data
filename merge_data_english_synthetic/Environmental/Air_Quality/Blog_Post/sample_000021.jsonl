Think about it: tiny particles, like P M two point five and P M ten, are floating around, sneaking into our lungs and causing all sorts of trouble, from respiratory problems to heart disease. Doctor Sharma at A I I M S has been ringing the alarm bells about this for years."}

A recent report from the C P C B (Central Pollution Control Board) highlighted some pretty alarming figures. And it's not just the big cities; even smaller towns are feeling the effects."}

Vehicle emissions are a major culprit, especially in densely populated areas. Industrial pollution, construction dust (think about all those new buildings going up!), and agricultural practices like burning crop residue also play a significant role. And of course, let’s not forget the impact of events like Diwali, where firecrackers contribute significantly to the pollution spike, sometimes exceeding acceptable levels by ten x."}

It might seem overwhelming, but small changes can make a big difference. Think about carpooling, using public transport (the Delhi Metro is a lifesaver!), planting trees (more green spaces equals cleaner air!), and supporting policies that promote cleaner energy. Even switching to energy-efficient appliances in your home can help. Think about investing in an air purifier, especially if you live in a heavily polluted area; a good one for a room of two hundred square feet costs around rupees ten thousand."}
