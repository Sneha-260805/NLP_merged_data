{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean and free from pollutants. These pollutants can be anything from dust and smoke particles (PM2.5 and PM10, often discussed in news reports) to gases like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). High levels of these pollutants can lead to a range of health problems, affecting everyone from young children to the elderly, impacting respiratory systems and even cardiovascular health.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean and free from pollutants.

{"unnormalised": "In India, factors like industrial emissions, vehicular traffic, agricultural burning (particularly stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana), and construction activities contribute significantly to poor air quality. Dr. Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at IIT Madras, often emphasizes the need for a multi-pronged approach to address this complex issue.", "normalised": "In India, factors like industrial emissions, vehicular traffic, agricultural burning (particularly stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana), and construction activities contribute significantly to poor air quality.

Simple actions like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (increasing green cover even in a small area of 100 sq ft helps!), and avoiding burning waste can make a difference.
