{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted. Pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) are key indicators. High concentrations of these pollutants can have detrimental effects on human health, leading to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer.", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted.

{"unnormalised": "In India, rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and agricultural practices contribute significantly to poor air quality. The burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season, for instance, sends plumes of smoke towards Delhi, worsening its already compromised air. Vehicular emissions in congested cities like Mumbai and Bangalore are also a major culprit.", "normalised": "In India, rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and agricultural practices contribute significantly to poor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitors air quality across India using a network of monitoring stations. They use the Air Quality Index (AQI) to communicate air quality information to the public. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating poorer air quality. An AQI above 100 is generally considered unhealthy for sensitive groups like children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) monitors air quality across India using a network of monitoring stations.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do to improve air quality? Individual actions matter. We can opt for public transport, carpool, or cycle whenever possible. Planting more trees, especially native species like Neem and Peepal, in our neighborhoods and schools can help absorb pollutants. Simple changes like using energy-efficient appliances and reducing our consumption can also make a difference. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) are striving to reduce pollution levels across 132 cities in India by 20-30% by 2024.", "normalised": "What can we do to improve air quality?

{"unnormalised": "Addressing air quality is a collective responsibility. From the government implementing stricter emission norms and investing in renewable energy to individual citizens making conscious choices, we all have a role to play in ensuring cleaner air for future generations. Investing in air purifiers for homes, especially those covering larger areas (e.g., 500 sq ft), can also offer some relief, but ultimately, prevention is better than cure. The Rs. 500 fine for burning waste is a step, but systemic changes are needed. Let's work together to breathe easier and create a healthier India.", "normalised": "Addressing air quality is a collective responsibility.
