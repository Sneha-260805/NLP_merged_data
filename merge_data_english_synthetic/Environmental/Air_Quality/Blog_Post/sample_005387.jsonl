{"unnormalised": "Think of air as a complex mixture, containing gases like nitrogen and oxygen essential for life, along with pollutants. These pollutants can be naturally occurring, like dust from the Thar desert, or man-made. Common culprits include vehicle emissions, industrial processes from places like Ghaziabad, construction dust, and even agricultural burning prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana post-harvest.", "normalised": "Think of air as a complex mixture, containing gases like nitrogen and oxygen essential for life, along with pollutants.

{"unnormalised": "The impact is far-reaching. Poor air quality exacerbates respiratory illnesses like asthma, particularly affecting children and the elderly. Dr. Sharma from AIIMS, Delhi, highlights the link between prolonged exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer.", "normalised": "The impact is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Measuring air quality relies on the Air Quality Index (AQI). Values below 50 are considered 'Good,' while anything above 300 is 'Hazardous'. Cities across India monitor AQI using sophisticated equipment, often displaying real-time data on public platforms.", "normalised": "Measuring air quality relies on the Air Quality Index (A Q I).

Government regulations promoting cleaner fuel technologies in industries and enforcing stricter emission norms for vehicles are vital.", "normalised": "So, what can be done?

{"unnormalised": "Consider also the impact of indoor air quality. Using air purifiers, especially during peak pollution periods, can significantly improve air quality inside your home, particularly in smaller spaces like a 500 sq ft apartment. Regular cleaning and ensuring proper ventilation are also important.", "normalised": "Consider also the impact of indoor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Organizations like the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi are actively researching and advocating for cleaner air policies. It is a collective effort, requiring participation from citizens, industries, and policymakers to create a healthier environment for everyone.
