{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how clean or polluted the air is. It's measured by the concentration of various pollutants, like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Think of it like this: PM2.5 are tiny particles, smaller than the width of a human hair! These can penetrate deep into our lungs and bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular problems.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how clean or polluted the air is.

On days with poor air quality, it’s best to limit outdoor exertion, especially for children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory problems.
