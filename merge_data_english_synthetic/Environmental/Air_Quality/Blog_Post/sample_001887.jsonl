{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean, breathable, and free from harmful pollutants. These pollutants, ranging from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) to gases like ozone and nitrogen dioxide, can have severe health consequences. Think respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and even cancer. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, Delhi, has highlighted the growing number of asthma cases, particularly in children, directly linked to poor air quality.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean, breathable, and free from harmful pollutants.

{"unnormalised": "India faces significant challenges in this area. Rapid industrialization, vehicular emissions, construction activities, and agricultural practices like stubble burning contribute heavily to air pollution, particularly during the winter months. Cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Patna consistently rank among the most polluted globally. The Taj Mahal, a symbol of India's rich heritage, is also facing damage due to air pollution.", "normalised": "India faces significant challenges in this area.

{"unnormalised": "Measuring air quality involves using sophisticated monitoring equipment that tracks the concentration of various pollutants. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a simple yet effective tool that provides a single, easy-to-understand number representing the overall air quality. An AQI value of 0-50 indicates good air quality, while anything above 300 is considered hazardous. You can often check real-time AQI data for your city online.", "normalised": "Measuring air quality involves using sophisticated monitoring equipment that tracks the concentration of various pollutants.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Promoting cleaner fuels, investing in public transport, implementing stricter emission standards for vehicles and industries, and promoting afforestation are crucial steps. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) are aiming to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024.", "normalised": "Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond government efforts, individual actions matter too. Opting for public transport or carpooling, planting trees in your neighborhood (even a small garden in your 100 sq ft balcony helps!), and supporting eco-friendly businesses can make a difference. Even small changes in our lifestyle can contribute to cleaner air and a healthier future for generations to come. Remember that Rs. 50 saved by carpooling could contribute to a healthier lung.", "normalised": "Beyond government efforts, individual actions matter too.
