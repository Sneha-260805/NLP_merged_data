{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how clean or polluted the air is. It's determined by measuring the concentration of various pollutants, like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). PM2.5, for instance, refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less – tiny particles that can penetrate deep into our lungs.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to how clean or polluted the air is.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitors air quality across India using a network of monitoring stations. They use the Air Quality Index (AQI) to communicate air quality levels to the public. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500+, with higher values indicating poorer air quality. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while 401-500 is classified as \"Severe,\" posing serious health risks.", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) monitors air quality across India using a network of monitoring stations.

{"unnormalised": "Factors contributing to poor air quality in India include vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction dust (often blanketing areas of 1000s sq ft during building), burning of crop residue, and seasonal weather patterns. In Delhi, for example, the burning of agricultural waste in neighboring states like Haryana and Punjab significantly worsens air quality during the winter months.", "normalised": "Factors contributing to poor air quality in India include vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction dust (often blanketing areas of thousands square feet during building), burning of crop residue, and seasonal weather patterns.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can be done? The government has implemented initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to reduce air pollution levels. Stricter emission norms for vehicles (Bharat Stage VI, or BS VI) and promotion of electric vehicles are also underway. Individually, we can contribute by using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (especially around residential areas), and avoiding burning waste. Even simple acts like properly covering construction sites can help.", "normalised": "So, what can be done?
