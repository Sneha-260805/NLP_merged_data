{"unnormalised": "Especially in India, with bustling cities like Delhi and Mumbai, air pollution can be a serious issue. We've all seen those hazy photos, right? The air quality index (AQI) often hits concerning levels, especially during Diwali and around harvest time when stubble burning is rampant in places like Punjab and Haryana. Remember the 2016 Delhi smog? It was a real wake-up call!", "normalised": "Especially in India, with bustling cities like Delhi and Mumbai, air pollution can be a serious issue.

{"unnormalised": "What causes this? A mix of factors really. Vehicle emissions are a big one, along with industrial pollution from factories and power plants. Construction dust doesn't help either! Then there's the weather – temperature inversions can trap pollutants close to the ground.", "normalised": "What causes this? A mix of factors really.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Plenty! Think about carpooling or using public transport. Even a small change like switching off your engine at red lights (yeah, even for those few seconds!) makes a difference. Supporting government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme launched on 10/01/2019 is also crucial. We can also plant more trees – our green lung power! Remember how the Chipko movement championed afforestation? That spirit still rings true.", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Plenty! Think about carpooling or using public transport.
