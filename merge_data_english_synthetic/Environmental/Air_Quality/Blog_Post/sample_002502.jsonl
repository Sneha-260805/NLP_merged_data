{"unnormalised": "Air quality has become a HUGE concern in India, especially in our bustling metros like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. We’re not just talking about a little smog; we're talking about pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, all released from vehicles, industries, construction, and even burning firewood during Diwali celebrations. Think about the constant honking and traffic jams near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus at 09:00 hrs – all those fumes building up!", "normalised": "Air quality has become a huge concern in India, especially in our bustling metros like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitor air quality and report the Air Quality Index (AQI). An AQI above 100 generally means the air is unhealthy. During peak season, some cities regularly see AQIs soaring above 300, even 400! Imagine the impact on our lungs, especially for kids and the elderly. Remember the lockdown in 2020, around April 14th? The air was noticeably cleaner, a stark reminder of how much our activities contribute to pollution.", "normalised": "Organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) monitor air quality and report the Air Quality Index (A Q I).

And let's remember, individual actions, combined, can make a real difference. Imagine if everyone took the metro even one day a week, by 15/08/2024, we could see a significant impact! Let's all breathe a little easier, shall we? Let’s aim for a cleaner Diwali this year; maybe reduce firecrackers? Small steps, big change. What are your thoughts?
