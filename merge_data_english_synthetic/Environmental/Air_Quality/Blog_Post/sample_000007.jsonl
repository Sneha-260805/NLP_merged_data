{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the cleanliness of the air we breathe. It's measured by the concentration of pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3). When these pollutants exceed safe levels, it can lead to a range of health problems, from respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis to cardiovascular diseases.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the cleanliness of the air we breathe. It's measured by the concentration of pollutants, such as particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), ozone (O three), nitrogen dioxide (N O two), sulfur dioxide (S O two), carbon monoxide (C O), and ammonia (N H three).

{"unnormalised": "India faces significant challenges in managing air quality. Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, vehicular emissions, and agricultural practices like stubble burning all contribute to the problem. Remember the Diwali celebrations in 2023? The air quality in several cities plummeted to hazardous levels post-festival. This is a recurring issue, highlighting the impact of our cultural practices, combined with other factors.", "normalised": "India faces significant challenges in managing air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Institutions like the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune are actively involved in monitoring and modeling air quality. They provide crucial data and insights to policymakers to formulate effective strategies. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. This ambitious goal requires a multi-pronged approach.", "normalised": "Institutions like the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (I I T M) in Pune are actively involved in monitoring and modeling air quality.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do as individuals? Plenty! We can opt for public transport, carpool, use cleaner fuels, plant trees (remember the Van Mahotsav celebrations!), and support policies that promote clean air. Imagine if every family in Mumbai switched off their vehicle engines at red lights, even for a brief 15 seconds! It might seem insignificant, but collectively, these small actions can make a big difference. Think of it as our contribution to building a Swachh Bharat, starting from 09:00 hrs every day.", "normalised": "What can we do as individuals? Plenty!
