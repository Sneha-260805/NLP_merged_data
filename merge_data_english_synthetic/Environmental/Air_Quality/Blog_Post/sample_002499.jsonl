Think of those brick kilns churning out smoke near Kanpur or the crop burning after harvest season in Punjab.

We, as individuals, can also make a difference. Carpooling, using public transport, planting trees (go green, people!), and supporting policies that promote cleaner energy sources are all steps in the right direction. Even switching to less polluting cooking methods like using LPG instead of burning wood can help, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "What can we do? The good news is, awareness is growing.
