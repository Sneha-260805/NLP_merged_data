{"unnormalised": "Air quality. It's something we often take for granted, until we can literally taste it. In India, particularly in bustling cities like Delhi and Kanpur, air quality has become a pressing environmental concern, impacting the health and well-being of millions.

{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The Air Quality Index (AQI), a number used by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is a handy tool to understand how clean or polluted the air is. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is hazardous. During Diwali celebrations, unfortunately, many Indian cities regularly breach the \"Hazardous\" level.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit. Think of the countless auto-rickshaws and cars navigating the streets of Mumbai, all emitting pollutants. Industrial emissions, especially from coal-fired power plants and factories, also play a significant role. Stubble burning in states like Punjab and Haryana after the rice harvest season contributes massively to the smog in Delhi and surrounding areas. Construction activities, often unregulated, kick up dust and contribute to particulate matter. And even burning wood or cow dung for cooking in rural areas adds to the problem.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are severe. Respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis become more prevalent. Dr. Sharma, a pulmonologist at AIIMS, has reported a significant increase in respiratory ailments among children in Delhi. Studies have linked long-term exposure to polluted air with cardiovascular diseases and even certain types of cancer. The economic impact is also substantial, with lost productivity and increased healthcare costs. One study estimated the economic burden of air pollution in India to be Rs. 260 billion annually.", "normalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are severe.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach. Promoting cleaner fuels, investing in public transportation, enforcing stricter emission standards for vehicles and industries, and implementing dust control measures are all crucial. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) are steps in the right direction, but require more robust implementation and public awareness. Even simple things like planting trees in your neighbourhood or switching to cleaner cooking fuels can make a difference. Consider installing an air purifier in your home (suitable for a room of say, 200 sq ft) and monitoring the AQI in your city regularly. We all have a role to play in breathing easier.", "normalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach.
