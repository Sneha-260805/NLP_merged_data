{"unnormalised": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to report daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating poorer air quality. Anything above 100 requires caution, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory problems. Think of Auntie Meena in Chennai who always complains about her cough getting worse during peak hours – that’s often linked to poor air quality.", "normalised": "the air quality index (A Q I) is a tool used to report daily air quality. it tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern. the A Q I ranges from zero to five hundred, with higher values indicating poorer air quality. anything above one hundred requires caution, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory problems. think of auntie meena in chennai who always complains about her cough getting worse during peak hours – that’s often linked to poor air quality."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. These include vehicle emissions, industrial pollution from sectors like the coal-fired power plants near Singrauli, construction activities, and burning of crop residue, particularly prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana after harvest season. Biomass burning for cooking in rural areas also plays a significant role. Remember the news reports from 15/08/1947 – our independence day – highlighting the urgency to address environmental issues for a truly free nation? Well, the urgency hasn't diminished.", "normalised": "several factors contribute to poor air quality in india. these include vehicle emissions, industrial pollution from sectors like the coal fired power plants near singrauli, construction activities, and burning of crop residue, particularly prevalent in states like punjab and haryana after harvest season. biomass burning for cooking in rural areas also plays a significant role. remember the news reports from fifteenth august nineteen forty seven – our independence day – highlighting the urgency to address environmental issues for a truly free nation? well, the urgency hasn't diminished."}
