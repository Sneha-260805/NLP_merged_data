{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the condition of the air around us. It describes the presence of pollutants, substances that can harm human health, ecosystems, and even the environment. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 – tiny inhalable particles) to ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the condition of the air around us.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in India monitors air quality across the country. They use the Air Quality Index (AQI), a simple scale that tells you how clean or polluted your air is. AQI values range from 0 to 500, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is considered \"Hazardous.\"", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) in India monitors air quality across the country.

They include industrial emissions from factories in areas like Gujarat, vehicular emissions, construction activities (think of the dust from that new shopping mall going up in your locality covering 20,000 sq ft), agricultural burning in Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season, and even household sources like burning wood or coal for cooking, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "Sources of air pollution are numerous and varied.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding the AQI in your area is the first step towards taking action. Simple things like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (a community initiative in your mohalla!), and supporting cleaner energy sources can make a significant difference. Even reporting illegal construction activities that generate excessive dust can help. Reducing our reliance on personal vehicles and advocating for stricter emission norms for industries are crucial steps. We need to invest in research and development for cleaner technologies, supported by governmental initiatives offering Rs. 5000 crore in subsidies. Let's strive for a cleaner, healthier Bharat for ourselves and future generations. The air we breathe is a shared responsibility.", "normalised": "Understanding the A Q I in your area is the first step towards taking action.
