Let's face it, air quality in India is a topic that deserves our attention.

{"unnormalised": "We often hear about AQI (Air Quality Index) – that number that floats around after 6 PM news bulletins. Anything above 100 usually means you should think twice about your morning jog. Cities like Kanpur, Varanasi, and even parts of Mumbai are frequently grappling with levels that are downright scary. Remember the smog that choked Delhi around Diwali, 2016? Scary stuff!", "normalised": "We often hear about A Q I (Air Quality Index) – that number that floats around after six P M news bulletins.

{"unnormalised": "What can *we* do? Plenty! Carpooling, using public transport, planting trees (maybe a Tulsi plant in your balcony!), avoiding burning waste, and being mindful of our consumption habits all make a difference. Even a small change like switching off your engine at traffic signals can help. And hey, maybe consider investing in an air purifier for your home, especially if you have elderly folks or young children. Checking the AQI before you leave home at 09:00 hrs isn’t a bad idea either. It's our responsibility to make sure future generations can breathe easy, just like our ancestors did back in the pre-industrial days. After all, \"Swachh Bharat\" includes \"Swachh Hawa,\" doesn't it? Let’s aim for an AQI we can all celebrate on 26/01/2024 (Republic Day)!", "normalised": "What can *we* do? Plenty!
