{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the presence and concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10 – think dust, smoke, and soot) to gases like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), all of which have negative impacts on our health.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the presence and concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit, especially in bustling metropolises like Mumbai and Kolkata. Industries spewing out smoke, construction activities kicking up dust, and the burning of agricultural residue are all significant contributors. Even our festivals, like the celebratory fireworks during Diwali on 24/10/2022, contribute to a spike in pollutants.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching. From respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, to cardiovascular problems, and even increased risk of cancer, the health consequences are serious. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. According to studies, prolonged exposure to polluted air can even affect cognitive development in children. Imagine little Rohan struggling in school because the air he breathes is affecting his ability to learn.", "normalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can be done? Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched on 10/01/2019, aim to reduce air pollution levels across the country. Individual actions also matter. Using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (remember the Van Mahotsav initiative?), and avoiding burning waste can all contribute. We can also support policies that promote cleaner energy and stricter emission standards. For example, the push for electric vehicles (EVs) and the promotion of BS-VI emission norms are steps in the right direction.", "normalised": "So, what can be done?
