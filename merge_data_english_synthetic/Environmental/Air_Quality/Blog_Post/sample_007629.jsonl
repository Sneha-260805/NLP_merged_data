{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). High levels of these pollutants can have serious health consequences, affecting everything from respiratory systems to cardiovascular health. Studies, including those conducted by institutions like IIT Kanpur, have shown direct links between poor air quality and increased hospital admissions.", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: during Diwali, we often see a spike in air pollution due to firecrackers. That smoky haze isn't just unpleasant; it's a cocktail of harmful chemicals impacting the air quality index (AQI). The AQI is a scale used to communicate how clean or polluted the air is, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. Anything above 100 generally signifies unhealthy air.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: during Diwali, we often see a spike in air pollution due to firecrackers.

{"unnormalised": "In India, sources of air pollution are varied. They include vehicle emissions, industrial activities (especially around areas like Noida), construction dust (think of all those new buildings coming up in Bangalore!), burning of agricultural waste, and even indoor cooking using traditional chulhas in rural areas. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year.", "normalised": "In India, sources of air pollution are varied.

Simple actions like using public transport, carpooling, opting for cleaner fuels, planting trees (even a small garden in your balcony!), and supporting policies that promote cleaner air can all make a difference. Dr. Sharma, a prominent environmental scientist, often emphasizes that individual actions, combined with governmental policies, are crucial for improving air quality. Even seemingly small things, like ensuring your car’s PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate is up to date, contribute. Reducing emissions from your vehicle not only helps the environment but also potentially saves you Rs. 10,000 in fines.", "normalised": "So, what can you do?

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, investing in air purifiers for your home (especially if you live near a busy road or in an area with high industrial activity) can help improve indoor air quality. Look for models suitable for the size of your room, for example, a purifier designed for 300 sq ft might be ideal for your bedroom. Air pollution is a complex issue, but with awareness and collective action, we can all play a part in ensuring cleaner, healthier air for ourselves and future generations in Bharat.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investing in air purifiers for your home (especially if you live near a busy road or in an area with high industrial activity) can help improve indoor air quality.
