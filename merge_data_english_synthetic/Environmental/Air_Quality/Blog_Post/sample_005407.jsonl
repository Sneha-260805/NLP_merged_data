{"unnormalised": "Air quality refers to the state of the air around us. It tells us how clean or polluted the air is. Pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are the usual suspects. High levels of these pollutants can lead to various health problems, from respiratory issues like asthma to heart diseases. Think about Diwali, for example; the bursting of firecrackers often leads to a significant spike in PM2.5 levels, impacting air quality severely.", "normalised": "Air quality refers to the state of the air around us.

{"unnormalised": "In India, air quality monitoring is conducted by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and various state pollution control boards, such as the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). They use sophisticated equipment to measure the concentration of these pollutants at different locations. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is then calculated, providing a simple, easy-to-understand number that indicates the level of air pollution. An AQI of 0-50 is considered 'Good', while anything above 300 is 'Hazardous'.", "normalised": "In India, air quality monitoring is conducted by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) and various state pollution control boards, such as the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (M P C B).

He also points out that the rampant construction activity, especially in rapidly growing cities like Bangalore, contributes significantly to dust pollution, affecting vast areas measured in sq ft.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at I I T Delhi, emphasizes the need for proactive measures. \"We need to transition to cleaner fuels, promote public transport, and implement stricter emission norms for vehicles,\" he states.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing air pollution requires a multi-pronged approach. The government is implementing policies like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. However, individual actions matter too. Planting trees (the \"Haritha Haram\" program in Telangana is a great example), using public transport, and carpooling can make a difference. Even simple things like avoiding burning waste can have a positive impact.", "normalised": "Addressing air pollution requires a multi-pronged approach.

Taking precautions, such as wearing a mask on heavily polluted days, can help protect your health. After all, clean air is not a luxury; it's a fundamental right, and preserving it is a collective responsibility. Ignoring it could cost us dearly – potentially in Rs. spent on healthcare.", "normalised": "Moreover, it is important to be aware of daily A Q I readings in your area.
