{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air. These pollutants can be anything from dust particles and smoke to harmful gases like ozone and nitrogen dioxide. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure and communicate the air quality. Think of it as a barometer for the air we breathe. An AQI value of 0-50 is considered good, while anything above 300 is hazardous.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of poor air quality is far-reaching. It contributes to respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, and even increases the risk of heart disease. Children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions are particularly vulnerable. Remember the lung ailments showcased so dramatically in the Bollywood film \"Breathe\"? While fictionalized, it highlighted the very real impact of respiratory distress.", "normalised": "The impact of poor air quality is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions from congested cities like Bengaluru, industrial pollution from factories, construction activities, burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana, and even seasonal factors like dust storms, all play a role. The burning of firecrackers during Diwali further exacerbates the problem in many cities, pushing AQI levels to alarming highs.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? We can use public transport, carpool, plant more trees (remember the Van Mahotsav celebrations!), and support policies that promote cleaner industries and alternative energy sources. Individual actions, combined with government initiatives and technological advancements, are crucial in improving the air quality and ensuring a healthier future for all of us. The time to act is now. Let's strive for a future where the air we breathe is clean and life-giving, not a health hazard.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
