Think about it: we breathe approximately eleven thousand liters of air every day. If that air is laden with pollutants, it directly impacts our lungs, heart, and even our brains. The Centre for Science and Environment (C S E) has been doing some incredible work highlighting the impact of vehicular emissions and industrial pollution on our air. Remember the odd-even scheme in Delhi back in two thousand and sixteen? That was one attempt to curb vehicular pollution, was not it?"}

Well, for starters, we can be more conscious of our actions. Opting for public transport when possible, using cleaner fuels, and supporting policies that promote cleaner air are all steps in the right direction. The National Green Tribunal (N G T) has been pushing for stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, and we need to hold our local authorities accountable too. We can also support initiatives that promote tree plantation and green spaces – think of the ancient wisdom of Van Mahotsav, celebrated annually!"}
