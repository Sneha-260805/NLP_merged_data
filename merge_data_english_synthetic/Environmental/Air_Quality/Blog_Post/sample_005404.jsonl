{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 – tiny dust particles) to gaseous pollutants like ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). High levels of these pollutants can have serious health impacts, ranging from respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis to cardiovascular diseases. Dr. Sharma, a leading pulmonologist at AIIMS, Delhi, often emphasizes the link between poor air quality and increased hospital admissions during winter months.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "In India, factors contributing to poor air quality are diverse. Vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction dust, and burning of agricultural residue, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana, all play a significant role. Think of the Diwali celebrations, beautiful as they are, which also contribute to a spike in pollution levels due to firecrackers.", "normalised": "In India, factors contributing to poor air quality are diverse.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial. The AQI is a scale used to report daily air quality. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while 301-500 is \"Hazardous.\" Monitoring is done by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which has stations across the country, providing real-time data.", "normalised": "Understanding the Air Quality Index (A Q I) is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Individual actions matter. Using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (a 100 sq ft garden helps!), and avoiding burning waste are all small steps that contribute to a larger impact. Promoting cleaner energy sources, stricter enforcement of pollution control measures by authorities, and sustainable agricultural practices are also vital. Rs. 500 crore have been allocated to tackle this issue in recent budgets. This Diwali, maybe consider lighting diyas instead of crackers for a cleaner celebration. Remember, cleaner air benefits everyone, from young Rohan playing cricket in the park to elderly Mrs. Devi enjoying her morning walk. Let's all do our part to ensure a healthier future.", "normalised": "What can we do? Individual actions matter.
