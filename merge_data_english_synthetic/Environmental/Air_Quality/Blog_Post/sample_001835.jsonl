{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted. Several factors contribute to poor air quality, including vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction, and even agricultural practices like burning crop residue, a common sight in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season. Dust storms, especially common in Rajasthan, also contribute significantly.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the degree to which the air is clean or polluted.

{"unnormalised": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to report daily air quality. It assigns a color and number to the air quality, ranging from \"Good\" (green) to \"Hazardous\" (maroon). Levels of key pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) are measured and used to calculate the AQI. PM2.5, tiny particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are particularly dangerous as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.", "normalised": "The Air Quality Index (A Q I) is a tool used to report daily air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Poor air quality has serious health consequences. Exposure can lead to respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing conditions are especially vulnerable. A study by Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, New Delhi, showed a clear correlation between increased PM2.5 levels and hospital admissions for respiratory ailments.", "normalised": "Poor air quality has serious health consequences.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. The government has implemented initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aiming to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. Stricter emission norms for vehicles (like Bharat Stage VI) and industries are also crucial. Individual actions, like using public transport, carpooling, and planting trees in our neighborhoods (even if it’s just a small garden of 100 sq ft), can collectively make a significant difference. Even simple practices like using a mask when outdoors on heavily polluted days can offer some protection. Air purifiers, costing anywhere from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 50,000 depending on the features and coverage area, are also becoming increasingly popular in Indian homes. Remembering the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi about environmental stewardship can inspire us all to act responsibly and protect the air we breathe for a healthier future.", "normalised": "Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach.
