{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality across the nation. Industrial emissions from factories in regions like Gujarat, vehicular exhaust fumes particularly in metropolitan cities, construction dust, and the burning of crop residue post-harvest in areas like Punjab and Haryana, all play significant roles. Seasonal variations, such as the onset of winter, exacerbate the problem due to temperature inversions that trap pollutants closer to the ground. The PM2.5 levels, especially during Diwali in November, often reach alarming highs, exceeding the permissible limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) by several times.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality across the nation.

Increased incidence of respiratory ailments, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain cancers are directly linked to poor air quality. Furthermore, the economic cost of air pollution in India is estimated to be substantial, impacting productivity and healthcare expenditure, amounting to several thousand Rs. crores annually.", "normalised": "Numerous studies, including research conducted by institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Kanpur, have highlighted the severe health implications of prolonged exposure to polluted air.
