{"unnormalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb). Each of these has different sources and health impacts. For instance, PM2.5, tiny particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers, can penetrate deep into the lungs and even the bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Think of the smoke from burning crop residue in Punjab and Haryana impacting Delhi's AQI (Air Quality Index).", "normalised": "Essentially, air quality refers to the level of pollutants present in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "In India, institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) play a vital role in monitoring air quality across the country. They collect data from various monitoring stations and use it to calculate the AQI. This index, ranging from 0-500, provides a simple way to understand how clean or polluted the air is. An AQI of 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is \"Hazardous.\"", "normalised": "In India, institutions like the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) play a vital role in monitoring air quality across the country.

{"unnormalised": "The sources of air pollution are diverse, ranging from vehicular emissions (particularly older vehicles with outdated emission standards), industrial activities in areas like the Yamuna River belt, construction dust (imagine the dust generated while building a new apartment complex of 2000 sq ft), and even household cooking using solid fuels like wood and dung. Addressing air pollution requires a multi-pronged approach, including stricter emission norms for vehicles and industries, promoting cleaner fuels, investing in public transportation, and implementing measures to control dust pollution.", "normalised": "The sources of air pollution are diverse, ranging from vehicular emissions (particularly older vehicles with outdated emission standards), industrial activities in areas like the Yamuna River belt, construction dust (imagine the dust generated while building a new apartment complex of two thousand square feet), and even household cooking using solid fuels like wood and dung.

{"unnormalised": "The economic costs of poor air quality are also significant. A study by TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) estimated that air pollution costs India billions of Rs. annually in healthcare expenses and lost productivity. Besides that, monuments like the Taj Mahal are seeing damage due to air pollution. We need more initiatives like the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR, alongside public awareness campaigns to encourage individual actions, such as carpooling and using public transport. Let's make clean air a priority for a healthier and more prosperous India.", "normalised": "The economic costs of poor air quality are also significant.
