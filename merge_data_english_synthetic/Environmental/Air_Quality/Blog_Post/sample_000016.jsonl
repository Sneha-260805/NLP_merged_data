{"unnormalised": "The primary culprits behind this deteriorating air quality are well-documented: vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and agricultural practices, particularly the burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana. The winter months often witness a dramatic spike in pollution levels, exacerbated by stagnant air and unfavorable weather conditions. This leads to the formation of thick smog, drastically reducing visibility and triggering respiratory ailments.", "normalised": "The primary culprits behind this deteriorating air quality are well-documented: vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and agricultural practices, particularly the burning of crop residue in states like Punjab and Haryana.

{"unnormalised": "Studies conducted by institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, have revealed alarming concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exceeding permissible limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). These microscopic particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing a range of health problems, including asthma, bronchitis, and even lung cancer. The economic burden of air pollution is also substantial, with increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity.", "normalised": "Studies conducted by institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Kanpur, have revealed alarming concentrations of particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten) exceeding permissible limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B).

Public awareness campaigns, similar to those used to promote Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, are needed to educate citizens about the dangers of air pollution and encourage them to adopt eco-friendly practices. Remember the smog-filled scenes depicting Mumbai in the Bollywood film \"Bombay Velvet\"? While fictionalized, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of unchecked pollution.", "normalised": "Furthermore, effective waste management practices and the adoption of sustainable agricultural techniques are essential.
