{"unnormalised": "Air quality, simply put, refers to how clean or polluted the air is. Things like dust, smoke, vehicle emissions (especially those old Ambassador cars!), and industrial pollutants all contribute to poor air quality. Remember that horrific smog episode in Delhi around Diwali 2016? That's a stark reminder of how bad things can get. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regularly monitors air quality across the country. You can usually find updates on their website or even on news channels.", "normalised": "Air quality, simply put, refers to how clean or polluted the air is.
