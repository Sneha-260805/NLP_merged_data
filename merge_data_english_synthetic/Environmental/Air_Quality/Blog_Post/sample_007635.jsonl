{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the cleanliness of the air we breathe. It's measured by monitoring the levels of various pollutants present in the atmosphere. These pollutants can include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. PM2.5, for instance, refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less – incredibly tiny particles that can penetrate deep into our lungs and even enter the bloodstream.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the cleanliness of the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "Sources of air pollution in India are diverse. Industrial emissions from factories in areas like Faridabad, vehicle exhaust from the ever-increasing number of cars and two-wheelers on roads, construction activities leading to dust, agricultural burning practices in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season, and even burning wood or cow dung for cooking in some rural areas contribute significantly. The impact of festivals like Diwali, with the widespread bursting of crackers, drastically worsens the air quality index (AQI) in many cities for several days.", "normalised": "Sources of air pollution in India are diverse.

{"unnormalised": "Poor air quality has serious health consequences. It's linked to respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, heart disease, lung cancer, and even premature death. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Beyond human health, air pollution also damages ecosystems, impacting crop yields and biodiversity. Think of the Taj Mahal, its marble slowly being eroded by pollutants!", "normalised": "Poor air quality has serious health consequences.

{"unnormalised": "Monitoring air quality is crucial. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) maintains a network of monitoring stations across the country. You can easily check the AQI for your city through various apps and websites. Understanding the AQI and taking necessary precautions, like wearing masks and avoiding outdoor activities on heavily polluted days, can help protect your health. Investing in air purifiers for your home (especially if you live in a high-pollution area) could be worth the Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 price range for a good one, depending on the coverage area in sq ft. Even planting trees in your garden or balcony can contribute to improving local air quality, however small the area may be. Tackling air pollution requires a collective effort from individuals, communities, and governments.", "normalised": "Monitoring air quality is crucial.
