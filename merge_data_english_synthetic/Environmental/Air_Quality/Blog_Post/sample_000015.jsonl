{"unnormalised": "According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels in several Indian cities consistently exceed permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). These microscopic pollutants, originating from vehicular emissions, industrial processes, construction activities, and agricultural burning, penetrate deep into the respiratory system, leading to a range of ailments.", "normalised": "According to the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B), particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten) levels in several Indian cities consistently exceed permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (W H O).

Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. The economic burden associated with treating these illnesses and the subsequent loss of productivity place a significant strain on the national exchequer, costing the nation potentially hundreds of crores Rs. annually.", "normalised": "Instances of respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain cancers are demonstrably linked to prolonged exposure to poor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to mitigate pollution levels in 132 cities by 20-30% by 2024. However, achieving meaningful and sustainable improvements requires a multi-pronged approach involving stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, investment in cleaner technologies, promotion of public transportation, and increased public awareness. The success of these initiatives also hinges on behavioural changes at the individual level, encouraging citizens to adopt more eco-friendly practices. Remember the smog-filled depiction of Delhi in the Bollywood film \"Delhi 6\"? While exaggerated for dramatic effect, it served as a stark reminder of the issue.", "normalised": "Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (N C A P) aim to mitigate pollution levels in one hundred and thirty two cities by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four.
