Or maybe you've seen those alarming AQI readings flashing on news channels, especially during winter months in North India. AQI, or Air Quality Index, is basically a scale that tells us how polluted the air is. Higher the number, the worse it is for our health.", "normalised": "Think about it.

{"unnormalised": "Why should we care? Well, breathing polluted air can lead to a whole host of problems, from simple coughs and sneezes to more serious respiratory illnesses like asthma and even heart disease. Studies at institutions like AIIMS, New Delhi, have linked prolonged exposure to poor air quality with decreased life expectancy. And it's not just adults who are affected; children are particularly vulnerable because their lungs are still developing.", "normalised": "Why should we care?

Think about using public transportation more often, carpooling with colleagues (maybe R. Sharma from accounts?), or even cycling to work if possible.

Regulations like the BS-VI emission standards are a step in the right direction.
