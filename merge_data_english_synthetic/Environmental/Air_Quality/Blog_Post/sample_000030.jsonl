{"unnormalised": "Air quality, simply put, refers to how clean or polluted the air around us is. And unfortunately, in many parts of India, especially our bustling cities, the air is far from clean. We’re talking about a cocktail of pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) floating around, eager to enter our lungs. These villains come from various sources - vehicle emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and even burning crop residue (parali).", "normalised": "Air quality, simply put, refers to how clean or polluted the air around us is.

Well, post-independence and the drive towards rapid industrialization, especially after 15/08/1947, we've seen air pollution levels steadily rise in many areas.

Respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis become more common, cardiovascular diseases are exacerbated, and there's even evidence linking poor air quality to increased cancer risk.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do about it? Well, the government has launched initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), aiming to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. Using public transportation more often, carpooling, and planting trees are small but significant steps we can take at the individual level. Even something as simple as avoiding burning trash can make a difference.", "normalised": "What can we do about it?
