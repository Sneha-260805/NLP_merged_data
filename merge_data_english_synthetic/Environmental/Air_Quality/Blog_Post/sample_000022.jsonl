Yeah, me too. Air quality in India is something we all need to be a little more aware of.

Things like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (even a few in your balcony garden helps!), and supporting businesses with eco-friendly practices can make a difference. Maybe even convince your neighbours to use less polluting crackers next Diwali!", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
