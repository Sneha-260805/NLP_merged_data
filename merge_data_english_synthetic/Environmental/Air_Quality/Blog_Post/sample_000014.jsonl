{"unnormalised": "The primary sources of air pollution in India are diverse and complex. Industrial emissions from factories, particularly in regions like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, contribute significantly. Vehicle exhaust, especially in rapidly growing cities with a high density of two-wheelers and older vehicles, adds to the problem. Construction activities, often unregulated, raise dust levels considerably. Furthermore, agricultural practices, such as the burning of crop residue after the harvest season in Punjab and Haryana, create hazardous smog that blankets the northern plains during the winter months.", "normalised": "The primary sources of air pollution in India are diverse and complex.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching. Respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and bronchitis, are on the rise. Studies conducted by institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) show a direct correlation between air pollution levels and an increase in hospital admissions for respiratory ailments. Long-term exposure can lead to more serious health problems, including heart disease and lung cancer. Economically, poor air quality impacts productivity and increases healthcare costs, placing a burden on individuals and the nation.", "normalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach. The government has implemented various initiatives, including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, using 2017 as the base year. Stricter emission norms for vehicles, promoting the use of public transport, and investing in renewable energy sources are also crucial steps. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns, similar to those depicted (albeit dramatically) in Bollywood films like \"Breath: Into the Shadows\" (though fictional, it touches upon organ damage from pollution), are essential to educate citizens about the risks and encourage responsible behavior.", "normalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond governmental efforts, individual responsibility plays a crucial role. Simple actions like using public transport, carpooling, planting trees (especially native species like Neem and Peepal), and avoiding burning solid waste can contribute to improving air quality. Supporting businesses that prioritize sustainable practices and advocating for stricter environmental regulations are also important ways to make a difference. The journey to clean air is a collective one, requiring the concerted effort of individuals, industries, and the government to ensure a healthy and sustainable future for India. The AQI readings regularly exceeding 300 in many cities are a stark reminder of the urgency of the situation. Addressing these issues requires investment - often costing Rs. 1000s per family per year in medical costs - and a shift in mindset.", "normalised": "Beyond governmental efforts, individual responsibility plays a crucial role.
