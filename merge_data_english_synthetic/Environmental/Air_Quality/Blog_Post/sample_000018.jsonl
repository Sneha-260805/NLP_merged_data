{"unnormalised": "According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), air pollution contributes significantly to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain cancers. Major sources of pollution include vehicular emissions, industrial activities particularly around cities like Kanpur and Kolkata, construction dust, and the burning of agricultural residue, a common practice post-harvest in states like Punjab and Haryana. This often leads to the infamous \"Delhi smog\" during the winter months.", "normalised": "According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (C S E), air pollution contributes significantly to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain cancers.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a crucial tool in monitoring the severity of pollution levels. Readings above 100 are generally considered unhealthy, and unfortunately, many Indian cities frequently record AQI values well above this threshold.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at A I I M S, New Delhi, emphasized the increasing number of patients presenting with respiratory problems directly linked to poor air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 20-30% by 2024. However, successful implementation requires collaborative efforts from governmental bodies, industries, and individual citizens. Promoting the use of public transport, adopting cleaner fuels, investing in green technologies, and regulating industrial emissions are essential steps. Plantation drives, like those conducted by NGOs in areas surrounding the Sundarbans, also play a role in improving air quality.", "normalised": "Government initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (N C A P) aim to reduce P M two point five and P M ten concentrations by twenty to thirty percent by two thousand and twenty four.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, indoor air quality should not be overlooked. Many Indian homes, particularly in rural areas, rely on biomass fuels for cooking, leading to high levels of indoor pollution. Switching to cleaner cooking fuels and improving ventilation are vital for safeguarding public health. Building materials, like paints used in constructing homes, can also impact indoor air quality. Choosing eco-friendly options for homes covering, say, 1200 sq ft, can make a difference.", "normalised": "Furthermore, indoor air quality should not be overlooked.

{"unnormalised": "The economic cost of air pollution is also substantial. A World Bank study estimates that air pollution costs India over Rs. 7 lakh crore annually. Addressing this environmental challenge requires a long-term commitment to sustainable development and a concerted effort to prioritize clean air for all Indians. We must all do our part to breathe easier. More stringent enforcement of environmental regulations is needed to ensure that industries comply and penalties, like fines of Rs. 50,000 or more, act as deterrents. It's a fight for our health and our future.", "normalised": "The economic cost of air pollution is also substantial.
