We worry about the food we eat, the water we drink, but often neglect the air we inhale. And let me tell you, in many parts of India, especially in our bustling cities like Delhi and Mumbai, that air is getting scarily unhealthy.", "normalised": "Namaste friends!

Collectively, we need stricter regulations on industrial emissions, promotion of cleaner fuels, and investment in public transportation. The government's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched a few years back, is a step in the right direction, targeting a 20-30% reduction in particulate matter concentrations by 2024 in selected cities. Let's hope they meet their targets!", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Individually, we can carpool, cycle instead of driving when possible, and plant trees.
