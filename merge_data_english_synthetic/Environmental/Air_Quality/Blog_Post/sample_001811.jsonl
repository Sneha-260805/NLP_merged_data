{"unnormalised": "We often hear about \"air quality\" in the news, especially in cities like Delhi and Kanpur. But what does it really mean, and why should we, as residents of India, be concerned? Simply put, air quality refers to the measure of how clean or polluted the air is. This measurement considers the presence of various pollutants – particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants can have significant impacts on our health and the environment.", "normalised": "We often hear about \"air quality\" in the news, especially in cities like Delhi and Kanpur.

{"unnormalised": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to communicate air quality to the public. It ranges from 0 to 500+, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is considered \"Hazardous.\" During Diwali celebrations, for instance, AQI levels often spike dramatically due to firecrackers, impacting cities across North India, including Lucknow and Jaipur.", "normalised": "The Air Quality Index (A Q I) is a tool used to communicate air quality to the public. It ranges from zero to five hundred plus, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) emphasizes the role of weather patterns in affecting air quality. Stagnant air and temperature inversions can trap pollutants, leading to higher concentrations near the ground. Sources of air pollution are diverse, ranging from vehicular emissions and industrial activity to construction dust and burning of agricultural waste. Burning crop residue in Punjab and Haryana contributes significantly to air pollution in Delhi every winter.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (I I T M) emphasizes the role of weather patterns in affecting air quality.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are serious. Respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis are exacerbated. Long-term exposure can lead to heart disease, lung cancer, and other chronic conditions. Children are particularly vulnerable. The impact on the environment is also significant, affecting crop yields and contributing to acid rain.", "normalised": "The consequences of poor air quality are serious.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Individual actions like using public transport, carpooling, and planting trees can make a difference. Promoting electric vehicles, investing in cleaner industrial technologies, and enforcing stricter regulations on construction sites are essential. We need policies that encourage sustainable practices and prioritize public health. Perhaps implementing stricter green building codes for new constructions, requiring a certain percentage of green space (e.g., 1000 sq ft) in residential projects. The cost, sometimes reaching Rs. 50000 for air purifiers, also makes clean air access an equity issue. Addressing air quality is a collective responsibility, requiring the participation of individuals, communities, and the government.", "normalised": "What can we do?
