A low A Q I means the air is relatively clean, while a high A Q I indicates pollution. But even a moderately high A Q I can cause problems for people with asthma or other respiratory issues. Doctor Sharma at A I I M S (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) has repeatedly warned about the long-term health consequences of prolonged exposure to polluted air."}

We’re breathing in fumes from cars, trucks, and construction sites. The sheer volume of vehicles in cities like Mumbai or Bangalore leads to a cocktail of pollutants. And let's not forget the impact of burning stubble in states like Punjab and Haryana after the harvest season. These fires release tons of particulate matter into the atmosphere, causing widespread air pollution that travels hundreds of kilometer."}

Well, on a personal level, we can try to use public transport more often, carpool, or cycle whenever possible. Investing in a good quality air purifier for our homes (especially if you live in a densely populated area or have small children) is also a good idea. Many affordable options are available for spaces around five hundred square feet."}

Stricter emission norms, investing in electric buses, and promoting cleaner energy sources are crucial steps. Campaigns like the National Clean Air Programme are a start, but more aggressive action is needed. The cost of inaction, in terms of public health and lost productivity, is far greater than any rupee amount we might spend on clean air initiatives. Let's demand cleaner air for ourselves and future generations. Imagine breathing fresh air in Delhi! A hopeful thought, right?"}
