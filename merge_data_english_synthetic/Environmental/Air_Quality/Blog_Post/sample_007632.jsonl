{"unnormalised": "Simply put, poor air quality has serious consequences for our health and environment. From respiratory problems like asthma, which affects millions, to long-term heart conditions, the pollutants we inhale take a heavy toll. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. The infamous Delhi smog, a common occurrence during Diwali due to fireworks and stubble burning in neighboring states like Haryana and Punjab, serves as a stark reminder of the issue.", "normalised": "Simply put, poor air quality has serious consequences for our health and environment.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit, especially in densely populated areas. Industrial activities, construction dust (imagine the dust emanating from a 10,000 sq ft construction site!), and agricultural practices such as burning crop residue also play significant roles. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been actively pushing for stricter regulations to curb these emissions.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "Measuring air quality involves monitoring the concentration of key pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). These measurements are used to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI), a single number that represents the overall air quality at a particular location. An AQI of 0-50 is considered good, while anything above 300 is hazardous. Data is often collected by organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and displayed online for public access.", "normalised": "Measuring air quality involves monitoring the concentration of key pollutants like particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), ozone (O three), carbon monoxide (C O), sulfur dioxide (S O two), and nitrogen dioxide (N O two).

{"unnormalised": "So, what can be done? The government is promoting cleaner fuels, investing in public transport, and incentivizing the use of electric vehicles. As individuals, we can contribute by opting for public transport, cycling, or walking whenever possible. Reducing our reliance on personal vehicles, conserving energy, and planting trees (like the sacred peepal tree) can all make a difference. Small changes in our daily lives, coupled with large-scale governmental efforts, are essential to ensuring cleaner air for all, from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari. After all, the cost of inaction, both in Rs. and in human health, is far too high. We owe it to future generations to breathe easier.", "normalised": "So, what can be done?
