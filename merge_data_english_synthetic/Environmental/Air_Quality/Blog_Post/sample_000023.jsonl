As Indians, particularly those of us living in bustling cities like Delhi or Mumbai, air pollution is something we unfortunately can't ignore. It’s not just an environmental issue; it's a public health crisis.", "normalised": "Namaste, friends! Ever notice how some days the air just feels…thicker?

We're talking about particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These bad boys come from a variety of sources – vehicle emissions, industrial activities near places like Bhiwandi, construction dust (especially with all that new sq ft being built!), and even burning agricultural waste after harvest.", "normalised": "We often hear scary stats like \"Delhi's air quality is ten times worse than W H O guidelines!\" And while those numbers can be overwhelming, understanding what’s *in* the air we breathe is the first step towards doing something about it.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we, as individuals and as a society, do? Carpooling, using public transport (the Delhi Metro is a lifesaver!), supporting stricter emission norms for vehicles, and planting more trees (especially in polluted areas like near industrial zones, say 5 km away) are all good starting points. The government is also rolling out initiatives, like the National Clean Air Programme, investing Rs. crores in solutions.", "normalised": "So, what can we, as individuals and as a society, do?
