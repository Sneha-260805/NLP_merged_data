{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe. These pollutants can range from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 - tiny particles that can deeply penetrate our lungs), to ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. High levels of these pollutants can have detrimental effects on our health, contributing to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the measure of pollutants present in the air we breathe.

{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in India monitors air quality across the country, using a network of monitoring stations. The data collected is then used to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI), a single number that represents the overall air quality. Think of it like a weather report, but for pollution. AQI values range from 0 to 500+, with higher values indicating worse air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered \"Good,\" while anything above 300 is deemed \"Hazardous.\"", "normalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) in India monitors air quality across the country, using a network of monitoring stations.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India. Industrial emissions from factories, especially around cities like Kanpur, are a major culprit. Vehicle exhaust, particularly from older vehicles, also plays a significant role. Construction activities, burning of crop residue after harvest season (often seen in Punjab and Haryana), and even Diwali celebrations with firecrackers contribute to the problem, especially around 09:00 hrs on the morning after.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to poor air quality in India.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences are serious. According to studies, air pollution shortens lives and impacts productivity. Children are particularly vulnerable, with increased risk of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) are crucial, aiming to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024.", "normalised": "The consequences are serious.

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Simple steps can make a difference. Use public transport whenever possible. Carpool with colleagues. Plant trees. Avoid burning garbage. Stay informed about air quality levels in your area (you can check the CPCB website). Advocate for stricter environmental regulations and enforcement. Remember, clean air is a collective responsibility. On a momentous day like 15/08/1947, we pledged to build a better nation; let’s include clean air in that vision. Even something as simple as accurately measuring pollution from brick kilns operating near villages like Rampur (Uttar Pradesh) can make a huge difference. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur is doing important work in this area, providing scientific solutions to environmental problems. Finally, remember that regulations concerning pollution from vehicles have been upgraded since 01/04/2017 with the introduction of Bharat Stage IV norms across the country.", "normalised": "What can we do?
