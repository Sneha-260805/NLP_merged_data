{"unnormalised": "Have you ever stepped outside on a November morning and felt that familiar scratch in your throat? That's often a sign of poor air quality. We're talking about levels of particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM10, Ozone, and other pollutants that can be harmful to our health. It's a serious problem, especially for kids, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions like asthma. My own Dadi in Karol Bagh feels it acutely on Diwali night – she needs her inhaler every year!", "normalised": "Have you ever stepped outside on a November morning and felt that familiar scratch in your throat?

{"unnormalised": "So, what's causing this? Well, a lot of things. Vehicle emissions are a big culprit. Then there's industrial pollution, construction dust, and agricultural burning in nearby states like Haryana and Punjab. And let's not forget the seasonal factors. During winter, cooler temperatures and less wind can trap pollutants closer to the ground. Remember that smog blanket over Delhi on 05/11/2023? Scary stuff!", "normalised": "So, what's causing this?

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? It’s a multi-pronged approach. The government is working on things like stricter emission standards (Bharat Stage VI), promoting electric vehicles, and investing in public transport (like the Delhi Metro). Even small steps like carpooling, using public transport whenever possible, and planting trees can make a difference.", "normalised": "What can we do? It’s a multi-pronged approach.

Think about it – on 15/08/1947, the day India achieved independence, imagine the air quality in villages compared to now! We need to prioritize clean air just as much as development. Let's all do our part to make our air a little bit cleaner, one breath at a time.
