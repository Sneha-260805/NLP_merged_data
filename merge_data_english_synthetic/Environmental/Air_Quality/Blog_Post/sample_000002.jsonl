{"unnormalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air. These pollutants can be anything from particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), which are tiny particles of dust, soot, and smoke, to gaseous pollutants like ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These come from a variety of sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial activities, agricultural practices like stubble burning (especially prevalent after the harvest season), and even construction dust.", "normalised": "Simply put, air quality refers to the concentration of pollutants in the air.

{"unnormalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far-reaching. Short-term exposure can lead to respiratory problems like coughing, wheezing, and asthma attacks. Long-term exposure, on the other hand, can increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, lung cancer, and even developmental problems in children. Think of the thick smog that often blankets Delhi during the Diwali season – those conditions are a clear indicator of hazardous air quality.", "normalised": "The effects of poor air quality are far reaching.

{"unnormalised": "India faces a significant challenge in this area. Cities like Kanpur, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad consistently rank among the most polluted in the world. This is due to a complex interplay of factors, including rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and a reliance on fossil fuels. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) diligently monitors air quality across the country and publishes the National Air Quality Index (AQI), providing real-time information to the public.", "normalised": "India faces a significant challenge in this area.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? The good news is, efforts are underway. Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024, taking 2017 as the base year. Stricter emission norms for vehicles, promoting public transport, and encouraging cleaner fuels are all part of the solution. Remembering the commitment made on 15/08/1947, on achieving independence, we also have a duty to protect our environment.", "normalised": "What can be done? The good news is, efforts are underway.

{"unnormalised": "On an individual level, we can make conscious choices to reduce our contribution to air pollution. This includes using public transport whenever possible, carpooling, planting trees (remember the \"Van Mahotsav\" celebrations?), and properly disposing of waste. Even small actions, like turning off your engine at red lights (especially at 09:00 hrs during peak traffic), can make a difference.", "normalised": "On an individual level, we can make conscious choices to reduce our contribution to air pollution.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, improving air quality requires a collective effort. From government policies to individual actions, every step counts. Monitoring the AQI regularly, perhaps checking it at 17:00 hrs each day, is a good practice. Institutions like IIT Delhi are actively researching solutions to combat air pollution. Let us all work together to ensure that future generations can breathe clean air in India.", "normalised": "Ultimately, improving air quality requires a collective effort.
