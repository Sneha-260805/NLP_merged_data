{"unnormalised": "The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) works hard to monitor air quality across the country, providing real-time data. You can often check the Air Quality Index (AQI) for your city. A high AQI, especially anything above 100, indicates a level of pollution that can be harmful, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory problems.", "normalised": "The C P C B works hard to monitor air quality across the country, providing real-time data.

{"unnormalised": "What causes this? Well, it's a complex mix. Vehicle emissions are a major culprit, especially those old diesel autos chugging along. Industrial emissions from factories located near residential areas don't help. Agricultural practices, like burning crop residue after the harvest (often around October-November) also contribute significantly. Construction dust, particularly in rapidly developing cities, is another big factor. My uncle, Mr. Sharma, living near a metro construction site in Gurgaon, constantly complains about the dust.", "normalised": "What causes this? Well, it's a complex mix.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, individually, we can make conscious choices like opting for public transport (even if it means taking the metro at 09:00 hrs!), carpooling, or switching to electric vehicles. We can also support policies that promote cleaner energy and stricter emission controls for industries. We should also try planting more trees! Maybe we can start a tree-planting drive on Independence Day, 15/08/2024.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce air pollution levels in several cities by 20-30% by 2024 (although, let's be honest, progress is slow).

Let’s all do our part to make that a reality for everyone in India. Even small steps, like properly disposing of waste and not burning it, can make a difference. Think about it! Maybe we can all pledge to do at least one thing to improve air quality, starting today! Let's aim for a healthier and cleaner Bharat!", "normalised": "Improving air quality is a long and challenging journey, but it’s a journey we must undertake together.
