Recent studies suggest that implementing stricter emission norms and promoting public transport can significantly improve air quality. The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), usually invoked around 15/10, outlines measures to be taken based on pollution levels. Shifting to cleaner fuels, promoting electric vehicles, and raising public awareness are crucial steps to ensure healthier air for all residents of the NCR. The current budget allocates Rs. 1000 Crores for air quality improvement initiatives.", "normalised": "The I I T-Delhi is working on advanced air purification technologies to combat the problem.
