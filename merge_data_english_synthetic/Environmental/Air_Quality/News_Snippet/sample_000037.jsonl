The burning of firecrackers during Diwali celebrations, alongside cooler temperatures trapping pollutants, often leads to a drastic decline in air quality. Even cooking practices, like using wood-fired stoves in rural areas or even the smoke from preparing large batches of biryani for community feasts, can contribute locally. Citizens are encouraged to monitor air quality indices (AQI) and take necessary precautions, especially individuals with respiratory ailments. The government is promoting initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to combat pollution and improve air quality across the country.", "normalised": "Adding to the concern is the approaching festival season.
