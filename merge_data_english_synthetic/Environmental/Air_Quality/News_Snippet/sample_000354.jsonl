{"unnormalised": "New Delhi – Air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plain, especially during the winter months, remains a critical environmental concern. Understanding the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial. The AQI, monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), uses a scale of 0-500, with higher values indicating poorer air quality and greater health risks. Common pollutants include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3).", "normalised": "New Delhi – Air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plain, especially during the winter months, remains a critical environmental concern. Understanding the Air Quality Index (A Q I) is crucial. The A Q I, monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B), uses a scale of zero to five hundred, with higher values indicating poorer air quality and greater health risks. Common pollutants include particulate matter (P M two point five and P M ten), nitrogen dioxide (N O two), and ozone (O three)."}

Initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 (base year 2017). The IIT Kanpur is also researching innovative solutions to mitigate pollution. Citizens can contribute by opting for public transport and planting trees, especially native species like Neem and Peepal. Checking the daily AQI forecast at 09:00 hrs before heading out is also recommended.", "normalised": "Long-term exposure to poor air quality can lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.
