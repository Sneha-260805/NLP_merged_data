Concerns are also mounting for vulnerable populations, particularly children and the elderly, who are more susceptible to respiratory ailments. The sale of air purifiers has reportedly seen a spike, mirroring trends observed during the festive season in recent years. The CPCB has also launched a public awareness campaign advising citizens to avoid prolonged outdoor activities when the AQI is poor. The agency hopes to reduce the levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particles in the air by promoting sustainable Diwali celebrations.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, Head of the Environmental Sciences Department at I I T Kanpur, urged citizens to adopt eco-friendly practices during Diwali celebrations to mitigate the adverse impact. \"Switching to green crackers and limiting firework displays can significantly improve air quality,\" he stated.
