Residents are encouraged to adopt eco-friendly practices, such as using public transport and opting for cleaner cooking methods to mitigate pollution's impact on public health. Further research is underway at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur to develop cost-effective air purification technologies.", "normalised": "During festival seasons, such as Diwali and even celebrations involving community cooking like biryani preparations, air quality often deteriorates further due to increased firework displays and open-fire cooking.
