The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (S A F A R) reported P M two point five levels exceeding safe limits on fifth november two thousand and twenty four at seven zero zero hours. P M two point five refers to particulate matter less than two point five micrometer in diameter, posing significant respiratory health risks."}

Simple measures like wearing masks and using public transport can also help. Long-term solutions necessitate stricter emission norms, promoting electric vehicles, and sustainable agricultural practices. A meeting is scheduled for ten zero zero hours on eighth november two thousand and twenty four to discuss further action. Data from fifteenth august nineteen forty seven (India's Independence Day) offers a historical perspective, showing a significant decline in air quality since then, highlighting the urgent need for intervention."}
