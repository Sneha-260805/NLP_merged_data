Regularly checking air quality data, available online at sites like CPCB at 14:00 hrs daily and adopting preventive measures like wearing masks during peak pollution hours (e.g., 07:00-11:00 hrs) are vital. Air quality data is updated every hour by some sources since 15/08/2015. Initiatives like planting more trees, promoting public transport, and transitioning to cleaner fuels are crucial for improving air quality in the long run.
