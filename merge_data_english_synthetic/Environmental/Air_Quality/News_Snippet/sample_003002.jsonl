Reducing personal vehicle use, embracing public transport like the Delhi Metro, and avoiding burning wood or garbage can make a collective difference. This year, during Onam celebrations, residents are encouraged to opt for eco-friendly decorations and minimise waste to mitigate pollution. Educating communities about the health impacts of poor air quality, including increased risk of respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems, is vital. A recent study by AIIMS, Delhi, shows a direct correlation between PM2.5 levels and respiratory ailments in children living within a 5 km radius of industrial areas.
