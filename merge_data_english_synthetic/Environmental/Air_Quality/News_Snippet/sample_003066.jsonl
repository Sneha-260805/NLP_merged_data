Switching to cleaner fuels, promoting public transport, and adopting dust control measures at construction sites are crucial steps. Understanding the link between our daily activities and air quality is the first step towards breathing easier. Remember, enjoying a plate of biryani outdoors doesn't have to come at the cost of our health. Monitoring AQI levels through apps and websites like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) can help us make informed decisions to protect ourselves.", "normalised": "Even during festive periods, like Diwali or post-Onam celebrations where burning of crackers and open cooking can temporarily worsen conditions, it's essential to be mindful.
