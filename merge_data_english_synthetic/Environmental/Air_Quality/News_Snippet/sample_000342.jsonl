{"unnormalised": "Long-term solutions involve transitioning to cleaner energy sources, promoting public transportation, and enforcing stricter emission norms. Remember to check your local AQI at 08:00 hrs and 18:00 hrs daily on websites like SAFAR-India to plan your outdoor activities. Staying informed is the first step towards protecting yourself and contributing to a healthier environment. For example, on 01/01/2023, AQI in Delhi was considerably better due to favorable wind conditions. Individual actions, like carpooling and using public transport, can collectively make a difference.", "normalised": "Long-term solutions involve transitioning to cleaner energy sources, promoting public transportation, and enforcing stricter emission norms.
