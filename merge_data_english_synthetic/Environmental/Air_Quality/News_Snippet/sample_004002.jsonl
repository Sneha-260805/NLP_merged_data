{"unnormalised": "The CPCB is implementing measures such as stricter enforcement of emission norms and promoting the use of public transportation in an effort to mitigate the issue. The government has allocated Rs. 500 crores towards combating air pollution in severely affected regions. Studies show a concerning increase of PM2.5 levels by 15% compared to the same period last year. A recent study by IIT Kanpur indicated that industrial sources within a 100 km radius of major cities contribute substantially to the deteriorating AQI.", "normalised": "The C P C B is implementing measures such as stricter enforcement of emission norms and promoting the use of public transportation in an effort to mitigate the issue.
