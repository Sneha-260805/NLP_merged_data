Many are foregoing the festive treat, a plate of hot biryani, eaten outdoors with family, due to health concerns. The CPCB has issued strict guidelines regarding cracker usage, but enforcement remains a challenge. Further interventions are crucial to mitigate the adverse health impacts associated with deteriorating air quality.", "normalised": "The timing is particularly worrisome, coinciding with the lead-up to Diwali celebrations, which often involve the bursting of firecrackers, further degrading air quality.
