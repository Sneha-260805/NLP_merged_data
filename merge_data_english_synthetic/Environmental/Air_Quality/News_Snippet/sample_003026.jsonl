Educating vendors on cleaner cooking methods and promoting the use of cleaner fuels are crucial steps. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Bombay, urges a multi-pronged approach involving stricter emission norms, improved public transport, and increased awareness to combat this persistent issue.", "normalised": "Additionally, the widespread consumption of street food, including the delicious but often cooked-over-open-fire biryani, contributes to localized air pollution hotspots.
