Seems like winter is bringing its usual haze party. The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) just released its latest report, and the P M two point five levels are, shall we say, higher than a kite flying on Makar Sankranti. Air Quality Index (A Q I) readings have hit the \"poor\" category in several areas, especially near Anand Vihar and R K Puram. Remember that scene from \"Breathe\" where Abhishek Bachchan’s character fights for his daughter’s life due to lung issues? Well, that feels a bit too real right now. Experts at I I T Kanpur are working overtime, trying to pinpoint the exact sources of the pollution. They're looking at everything from vehicle emissions to stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab. They are suggesting citizens to take extra precautions like wearing masks while going out. Rupee five thousand fine could be levied for not wearing a mask. Let's hope the authorities and we as citizens can breathe easier soon! Stay safe and Diwali is coming... think before you burst those crackers! The air is ten times cleaner two kilometer away from Delhi border."}
