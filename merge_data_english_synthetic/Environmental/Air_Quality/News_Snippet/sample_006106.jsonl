{"unnormalised": "Air quality, a crucial environmental indicator, has been a persistent concern in the Delhi-NCR region, particularly during the winter months. The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10, tiny particles that can deeply penetrate the lungs and cause respiratory problems. Levels are often reported at 07:00 hrs and 19:00 hrs daily.", "normalised": "Air quality, a crucial environmental indicator, has been a persistent concern in the Delhi-N C R region, particularly during the winter months.

The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by the Indian government, aims to reduce particulate matter concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 using 2017 as the base year. Understanding the AQI and taking preventative measures, such as wearing masks and limiting outdoor activities during peak pollution times, is essential for protecting public health. Research indicates improvements can be seen when emission norms like Bharat Stage VI are strictly followed.
