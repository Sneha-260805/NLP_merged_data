{"unnormalised": "The adverse effects of poor air quality on public health are well-documented, with respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems on the rise. This coincides with the Onam festival season when increased travel and celebratory activities may further contribute to pollution levels. The CPCB has issued advisories encouraging citizens to use public transportation and avoid burning wood or coal. Measures are being considered including subsidies on electric vehicles and stricter enforcement of emission norms. Air quality near certain industrial zones has reached hazardous levels, with PM2.5 levels exceeding 300 µg/m3 in some areas. Further studies are underway to assess the long-term impact of consuming traditional foods like biryani, often cooked using wood-fired ovens, on indoor air quality.", "normalised": "The adverse effects of poor air quality on public health are well-documented, with respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems on the rise.
