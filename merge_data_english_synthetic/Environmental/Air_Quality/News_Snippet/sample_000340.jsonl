The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10, tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs. Higher AQI values signify poorer air quality and increased health risks.", "normalised": "Air quality, particularly in urban centers like Delhi, often becomes a major concern around Diwali.

Regulations are in place to restrict firecracker usage, particularly after 22:00 hrs on Diwali night. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be monitoring air quality levels throughout the Diwali period (November 12, 2024) and publishing real-time data. Citizens can check the AQI at various monitoring stations via the SAMEER app. Air quality is generally at its worst at 06:00 hrs on the 13th. Reducing emissions is crucial for a healthier Diwali and a cleaner future for all.
