The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) reported an Air Quality Index (A Q I) of three hundred and forty five in Anand Vihar today, categorized as 'very poor'. Experts from I I T-Kanpur warn that bursting firecrackers during Diwali celebrations could significantly exacerbate the already deteriorating conditions, potentially pushing the A Q I into the 'severe' zone. This poses a significant health risk, especially for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Furthermore, stubble burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana contributes significantly to the rising pollution levels. The government has announced initiatives, including subsidies worth rupees fifty crores, to encourage farmers to adopt alternative methods. Adding to the regional challenge, a recent study by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (N E E R I) identified vehicular emissions as a major contributor to poor air quality in Mumbai, especially in areas with high traffic density, reaching P M two point five levels exceeding one hundred and fifty micrograms per cubic meter in some locations. This casts a shadow even on festive occasions like Onam, as outdoor celebrations become less appealing. The government urges citizens to be mindful of their impact and explore eco-friendly options for festivities."}
