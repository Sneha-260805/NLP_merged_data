Seems like its effect is fading. The Central Pollution Control Board (C P C B) reported a dip in air quality across several Indian cities this past week, with Delhi N C R experiencing particularly high levels of P M two point five. Experts at I I T Kanpur are studying the impact of stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab, a recurring culprit this time of year. The A Q I has soared past 'poor' levels in many areas, even hitting 'severe' in some hotspots. Doctors are advising vulnerable populations, like children and the elderly, to stay indoors. Remember that scene in \"Baghban\" where Amitabh Bachchan struggles to breathe in polluted Delhi? Sadly, it's still relatable for many. The government is considering implementing stricter emission norms for vehicles and industries. Let's hope these measures bring us some much-needed relief and cleaner air to breathe."}
