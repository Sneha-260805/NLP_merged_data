Recent data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that PM2.5 levels often exceed safe limits, especially around Diwali time on dates like 24/10/2022 and 12/11/2023. These tiny particulate matters, smaller than 2.5 micrometers, can penetrate deep into the lungs, posing serious health risks.", "normalised": "New Delhi continues to grapple with air quality concerns, particularly during the winter months.

Citizens are advised to check the Air Quality Index (AQI) regularly, available online and on mobile apps, before venturing outdoors, especially between 07:00 hrs and 09:00 hrs when pollution is often at its peak. The government's Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is implemented during periods of severe air pollution, introducing restrictions like construction halts and traffic regulations.", "normalised": "Experts recommend measures such as using public transport, carpooling, and planting more trees, specifically native species like Neem and Peepal, known for their air-purifying qualities.
