{"unnormalised": "Air quality in the Delhi NCR region continues to be a major concern, especially as we approach the winter months. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), particulate matter levels, particularly PM2.5 and PM10, often exceed permissible limits set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. These pollutants, largely from vehicular emissions, industrial activity, and agricultural burning in neighbouring states like Haryana and Punjab, pose significant health risks, especially to children and the elderly.", "normalised": "Air quality in the Delhi N C R region continues to be a major concern, especially as we approach the winter months.
