{"unnormalised": "The Delhi government has implemented measures such as odd-even schemes and increased public transport, but their long-term effectiveness is under scrutiny. Experts suggest a multi-pronged approach, including stricter enforcement of emission norms, promotion of electric vehicles, and incentivizing farmers to adopt alternative methods to stubble burning. The development of green spaces, even small parks of 500 sq ft, can help improve localized air quality. The estimated annual cost to address the issue is Rs. 5000 crore, according to a parliamentary committee. Furthermore, a citizen awareness campaign referencing the importance of clean air, drawing parallels to practices in ancient Indian texts like the Vedas, is deemed crucial.", "normalised": "The Delhi government has implemented measures such as odd-even schemes and increased public transport, but their long-term effectiveness is under scrutiny.
