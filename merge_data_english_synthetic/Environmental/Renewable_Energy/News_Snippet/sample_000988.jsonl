{"unnormalised": "The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has announced new subsidies for rooftop solar installations, making it more affordable for homeowners to generate their own electricity. For example, a 1000 sq ft rooftop can generate a substantial amount of power. Investment in renewable energy projects in India is estimated to be around Rs. 50,000 crore this year, signifying a strong commitment towards green energy. These efforts align with India's Panchamrit goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.", "normalised": "The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (M N R E) has announced new subsidies for rooftop solar installations, making it more affordable for homeowners to generate their own electricity.
