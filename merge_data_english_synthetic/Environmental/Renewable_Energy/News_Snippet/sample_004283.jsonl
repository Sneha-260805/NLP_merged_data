{"unnormalised": "This transition not only reduces India's reliance on fossil fuels but also creates employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, various subsidies and financial incentives are being offered to encourage individuals and businesses to adopt renewable energy solutions, bringing the cost down to nearly Rs. 2.5 per unit for solar power in certain regions. This commitment aligns with India's pledge at COP26 to reduce its carbon intensity and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future for all.", "normalised": "This transition not only reduces India's reliance on fossil fuels but also creates employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas.
