Investing in R&D is crucial, with significant funds being allocated under various schemes, some amounting to Rs. 50,000 crores, to accelerate innovation. The goal is to achieve energy independence and a cleaner environment for future generations, echoing Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of sustainable living. Initiatives like the PM-KUSUM scheme, promoting solar pumps for farmers, are also gaining traction. Furthermore, new biogas plants are being built with a combined capacity of 10,000 sq ft across the country.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain, including grid integration and the need for robust energy storage solutions.
