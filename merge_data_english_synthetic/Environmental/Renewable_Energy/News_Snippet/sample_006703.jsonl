{"unnormalised": "The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced new incentives for rooftop solar installations, offering subsidies of up to Rs. 50,000 for residential buildings. This initiative aims to encourage wider adoption and reduce carbon emissions. Wind energy projects are also expanding across the western coast, with new turbines planned for Gujarat. These projects not only generate clean electricity but also create employment opportunities for local communities. The Bhadla Solar Park, one of the largest in the world, spans over 14,000 acres (approx. 600 million sq ft), demonstrating India's commitment to large-scale renewable energy infrastructure. Efforts are also underway to explore tidal energy along the Indian coastline, promising a sustainable source of power for the future.", "normalised": "The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (M N R E) announced new incentives for rooftop solar installations, offering subsidies of up to rupee fifty thousand for residential buildings.
