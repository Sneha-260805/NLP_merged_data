The cost of solar power has also reduced significantly, making it a viable alternative to traditional energy sources. Experts predict continued growth in the sector, driven by government support and decreasing costs. The initiative will help save Rs. 20,000 per household annually. This supports the Panchamrita vision for Net Zero by 2070.", "normalised": "Furthermore, Rajasthan is emerging as a solar hub, with vast tracts of desert land ideal for large-scale solar farms.
