The government is also offering subsidies, with some reports showing Rs. 2,00,000 incentive for rooftop solar installations, fostering greater adoption. Further investment is needed to improve grid infrastructure and energy storage to support the intermittent nature of renewable sources. The target of 500 GW by 2030 is ambitious, but achievable with continued commitment.", "normalised": "\"Harnessing renewable energy is crucial for a sustainable future, echoing the Gandhian principle of self-sufficiency,\" states Mister Rajesh Kumar, an environmental activist.
