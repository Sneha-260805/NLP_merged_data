{"unnormalised": "The state government is also offering incentives for rooftop solar installations, targeting residential and commercial buildings across urban centers like Jaipur and Udaipur. Subsidies are available for installations up to 1000 sq ft, offering significant savings to homeowners, potentially reducing electricity bills by Rs. 5000 annually. This shift towards renewable energy is crucial for India to meet its climate change commitments. Experts predict that by 2030, Rajasthan could contribute significantly towards India's target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity.", "normalised": "The state government is also offering incentives for rooftop solar installations, targeting residential and commercial buildings across urban centers like Jaipur and Udaipur. Subsidies are available for installations up to one thousand square feet, offering significant savings to homeowners, potentially reducing electricity bills by rupees five thousand annually. This shift towards renewable energy is crucial for India to meet its climate change commitments. Experts predict that by two thousand and thirty, Rajasthan could contribute significantly towards India's target of five hundred gigawatt of renewable energy capacity."}
