A typical residential installation of 1000 sq ft can save a household Rs. 25,000 annually on electricity bills. This shift towards cleaner energy sources is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and achieving India's climate goals. The challenge now lies in improving energy storage solutions to ensure a reliable and consistent supply of renewable energy.", "normalised": "Beyond large-scale projects, rooftop solar installations are gaining popularity in urban areas.
