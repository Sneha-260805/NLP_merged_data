Each family will receive a subsidized connection, costing approximately Rs. 5000, with monthly tariffs based on usage. The project also aims to create local employment, training villagers in the maintenance and repair of the renewable energy infrastructure. This endeavour promises a brighter and greener future, powered by the sun and wind, across the vast landscapes of Rajasthan. The estimated coverage area of initial solar installations is ~2000 sq ft per village.", "normalised": "the initiative includes community awareness programs, educating villagers about the benefits of clean energy. each family will receive a subsidized connection, costing approximately rupees five thousand, with monthly tariffs based on usage. the project also aims to create local employment, training villagers in the maintenance and repair of the renewable energy infrastructure. this endeavour promises a brighter and greener future, powered by the sun and wind, across the vast landscapes of rajasthan. the estimated coverage area of initial solar installations is approximately two thousand square feet per village."}
