Farmers are also benefiting, with solar-powered irrigation pumps saving them Rs. 20,000 annually on electricity bills on average. Some are even converting unused land into solar farms, earning extra income. This sustainable shift is also creating new jobs in manufacturing and maintenance, covering everything from large installations to rooftop systems on just 500 sq ft.", "normalised": "Meanwhile, a pilot project in Kerala is exploring the use of tidal energy.
