In a small village near Pune, they've installed solar panels on the panchayat building, saving them a bundle on electricity bills. Plus, a group of students from Delhi University are working on a project to build low-cost solar water heaters using recycled materials – pretty impressive! Imagine the impact if every rooftop had solar panels, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari! A single house in Mumbai might save approximately two thousand square feet of carbon footprint over its lifetime with renewable energy. This feels like a real Swachh Bharat for our power grid!"}
