The financial outlay for these projects exceeds Rs. 20,000 crore. Experts estimate that these initiatives will help reduce carbon emissions significantly and contribute to cleaner air, especially in densely populated areas. Even residential areas are contributing, with some installing panels on rooftops covering 1000 sq ft. The future looks bright for a greener India, powered by the sun and the wind.", "normalised": "Recent reports indicate that wind energy projects spanning over five hundred kilometer are underway in Tamil Nadu, further bolstering the nation's renewable energy capacity.
