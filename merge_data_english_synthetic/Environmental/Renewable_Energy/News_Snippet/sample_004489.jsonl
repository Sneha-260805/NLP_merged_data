{"unnormalised": "Experts believe that wider adoption requires increased public awareness and investment in research and development. The cost of solar panels, though decreasing, remains a hurdle for many. Initiatives like subsidized solar rooftop installations are helping bridge this gap. Rs. 500 crores have been allocated this year alone towards promoting renewable energy solutions in rural communities, bringing clean power to areas still relying on traditional methods. These solutions include solar powered irrigation pumps, reducing reliance on diesel and supporting agricultural sustainability.", "normalised": "Experts believe that wider adoption requires increased public awareness and investment in research and development.
