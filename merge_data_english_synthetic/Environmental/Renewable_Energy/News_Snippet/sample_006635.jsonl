The initiative will not only light up homes but also power small businesses, boosting the local economy. Villages within a 20 km radius of the Nagpur solar plant will be prioritized. Initial estimates predict a reduction of carbon emissions by 10,000 tonnes annually. Let's hope this becomes a model for the rest of India!", "normalised": "Funding for the rupee five crore project comes from a partnership between the state government and a private renewable energy firm based in Pune.
