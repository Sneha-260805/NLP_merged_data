Rajasthan, already famous for its sunny disposition, is set to become even brighter thanks to a major push for renewable energy. Doctor Sharma, head of the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation, announced new projects aiming to generate an additional five thousand megawatt of solar power in the Thar desert. This initiative includes a massive solar park near Jaisalmer, spanning over ten thousand square feet. Funding comes partly from the central government and involves private players like Adani Green and Tata Power. \"Bijli for every ghar!\" Doctor Sharma exclaimed, highlighting the project's aim to provide affordable electricity to remote villages. This shift to renewable sources should also reduce Rajasthan's reliance on coal-fired power plants, cutting down on pollution. The total investment is estimated at a whopping rupee twenty five thousand crore. Experts believe this will create thousands of jobs in the region, especially in manufacturing and maintenance of solar panels. The project is expected to be fully operational within three years, powering homes and industries across the state."}
