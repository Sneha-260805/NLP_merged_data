The government is also exploring the potential of biomass energy, utilizing agricultural waste to produce power, a practice deeply rooted in rural Indian traditions. These efforts contribute to a cleaner environment and a more sustainable future for generations to come. This could lead to less pollution in cities like Delhi, which is known for high pollution levels.", "normalised": "Furthermore, large-scale wind farms are being developed along the coast, generating clean electricity and creating jobs.
