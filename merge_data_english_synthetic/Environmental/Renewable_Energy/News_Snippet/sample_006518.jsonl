Doctor Anjali Sharma, a leading environmental scientist at I I T-Delhi, emphasizes the urgency, stating, \"The shift to renewables is no longer a choice, but a necessity for our future generations.\" Recent data shows a significant uptick in solar power generation in Rajasthan, particularly in the Thar Desert, where several large-scale solar parks are now operational, covering thousands of square feet. The government’s initiative, the National Solar Mission, aims to boost solar capacity to one hundred G W by two thousand and twenty two. Investments in wind energy are also on the rise, with Tamil Nadu leading the way. The state has significant wind potential, especially in the coastal regions. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (I R E D A) is playing a crucial role in providing financial assistance to renewable energy projects. Rupee twenty thousand crore has been allocated to strengthen the renewable sector in the latest budget. Experts predict that India can become a global leader in renewable energy, drawing upon its traditional reverence for nature, as reflected in practices like worshipping Surya Dev (the Sun God)."}
