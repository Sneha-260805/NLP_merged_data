{"unnormalised": "Investment in renewable energy reached Rs. 2.5 lakh crore in the past year, but experts suggest a need for increased focus on energy storage solutions to address the intermittent nature of solar and wind power. Furthermore, integration of renewable energy sources into the existing grid infrastructure remains a complex task, requiring significant upgrades. The state of Tamil Nadu is pioneering innovative grid management techniques to handle the increasing influx of renewable energy. The long term cost effectiveness of solar and wind is still a key concern for many states.", "normalised": "Investment in renewable energy reached rupee two point five lakh crore in the past year, but experts suggest a need for increased focus on energy storage solutions to address the intermittent nature of solar and wind power.
