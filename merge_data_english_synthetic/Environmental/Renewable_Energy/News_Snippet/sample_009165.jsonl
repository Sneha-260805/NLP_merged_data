Recent reports indicate a drop of 15% in the cost of solar panels, making it more accessible for rural communities. Subsidies are also being provided for rooftop solar installations, covering up to 40% of the cost, encouraging homeowners to generate their own electricity. A new biogas plant in Uttar Pradesh will power 2000 homes, utilizing agricultural waste and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The plant covers 5000 sq ft. The initiative involves Rs. 20 crore investment. Experts predict that renewable energy sources will account for 50% of India's total energy consumption by 2030. This is a positive step towards combating climate change and ensuring energy security for all Indians.", "normalised": "The government is investing heavily in wind energy projects across Tamil Nadu, further diversifying its renewable energy mix.
