{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, encompassing solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, offers a viable alternative. India, blessed with abundant sunlight, has the potential to become a global leader in solar energy. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) launched in 2010, aimed at establishing India as a global leader in solar energy, has seen significant progress, with installations reaching several Gigawatts.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, encompassing solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, offers a viable alternative.

{"unnormalised": "Wind energy is also gaining traction, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Hydropower, while a long-standing source, requires careful environmental impact assessment, as large dams can displace communities and disrupt ecosystems. Biomass, utilizing agricultural waste and other organic matter, presents a sustainable way to generate electricity in rural areas, potentially benefiting farmers across states like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "Wind energy is also gaining traction, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi is currently researching ways to improve the efficiency of solar panels by 15% using advanced materials. Investing in R&D is crucial to overcome technological hurdles. Government initiatives like subsidies and tax breaks are also essential to encourage wider adoption by individuals and businesses. Consider rooftop solar panels on your house in Mumbai; even a small installation of 100 sq ft can reduce your electricity bills by a considerable amount, maybe even Rs. 5000 per month. The future requires a collaborative effort from the government, industry, and individuals to secure a sustainable and energy-independent India.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at I I T Delhi is currently researching ways to improve the efficiency of solar panels by fifteen percent using advanced materials.
