And the coastal areas in Tamil Nadu offering great wind energy opportunities. Plus, we already have quite a few hydroelectric projects, like the Bhakra Nangal Dam. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is pushing hard with various schemes and subsidies, making rooftop solar installations more affordable for families like the Sharmas in Delhi (who recently installed a system on their 1500 sq ft terrace!).", "normalised": "On the one hand, the potential is immense!

We need a balanced approach, considering both the economic and social aspects, and investing heavily in R&D to make it more accessible and efficient. The goal should be energy independence, affordability, and a greener planet, and not just generating Rs. 100 crore in revenue! What are your thoughts?
