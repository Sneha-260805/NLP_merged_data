{"unnormalised": "India, blessed with abundant sunshine, wind, and water resources, possesses immense potential for harnessing renewable energy. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, launched in 2010, has been instrumental in promoting solar power across the country. Rajasthan, with its vast desert landscapes, is becoming a hub for solar energy generation. Likewise, wind energy projects are flourishing in states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.", "normalised": "India, blessed with abundant sunshine, wind, and water resources, possesses immense potential for harnessing renewable energy.

{"unnormalised": "Investing in renewable energy projects brings several benefits. Besides reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change impacts, it also enhances energy security, creates new job opportunities, and improves air quality, particularly in densely populated cities like Delhi. The Indian government is actively promoting renewable energy through various policies and subsidies.", "normalised": "Investing in renewable energy projects brings several benefits.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Land acquisition for large-scale projects, intermittency of solar and wind power, and the high initial investment costs are some hurdles that need to be addressed. Grid infrastructure also needs significant upgrading to accommodate the fluctuating supply from renewable sources. Initiatives like the Green Energy Corridor are crucial in this regard.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "The target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, announced by the Prime Minister, is ambitious but achievable with concerted efforts from the government, industry, and citizens. Remember our independence day on 15/08/1947 and our need for energy independence. A webinar is scheduled on 25/12/2024 at 09:00 hrs to discuss the latest advancements in renewable energy technology at IIT Madras. Public transport can also benefit, like electric buses in Bangalore which started running around 2018. We need coordinated action to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future. Furthermore, the cost of solar panels is steadily decreasing which makes it more affordable than ever before.", "normalised": "The target of achieving five hundred gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by two thousand and thirty, announced by the Prime Minister, is ambitious but achievable with concerted efforts from the government, industry, and citizens.
