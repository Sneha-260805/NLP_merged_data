{"unnormalised": "What exactly ARE the benefits? Firstly, reduced pollution. Unlike coal-fired power plants that contribute significantly to air pollution in cities like Delhi, renewable energy produces little to no emissions during operation. Secondly, energy independence. Relying less on imported fossil fuels (which fluctuate wildly in price) strengthens our economy and reduces vulnerability. Imagine Rajasthan powering much of North India with solar farms!", "normalised": "What exactly ARE the benefits? Firstly, reduced pollution.

{"unnormalised": "India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming for a significant percentage of our power from renewable sources by 2030. This will require further investment, policy support, and public awareness. A transition to renewable energy promises a healthier environment, a stronger economy, and a more secure future for generations to come. The cost of inaction, in terms of environmental damage and increased healthcare costs (Rs. for treatment of respiratory illnesses), far outweighs the investment needed now.", "normalised": "India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming for a significant percentage of our power from renewable sources by two thousand and thirty.
