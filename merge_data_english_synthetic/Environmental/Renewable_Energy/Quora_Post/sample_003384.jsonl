{"unnormalised": "Why is this important for us in India? Firstly, it reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels, saving valuable Rs. For instance, imagine if all the households in Delhi had solar panels on their roofs – that's a significant reduction in energy consumption from traditional sources! Secondly, it creates new job opportunities in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems. My cousin, Priya, works at a wind turbine factory near Coimbatore. Thirdly, it combats climate change and helps us achieve our environmental goals.", "normalised": "Why is this important for us in India?
