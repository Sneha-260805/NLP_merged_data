Today, rooftop solar panels are becoming more common, even in cities like Delhi, with subsidies making them more affordable for homeowners. A typical installation might cover 500 sq ft and save a significant amount on electricity bills.", "normalised": "India has made significant strides in this field.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Land acquisition for large-scale projects can be difficult. And intermittency – the fact that solar and wind power are dependent on weather conditions – needs to be addressed with better energy storage solutions. Also, manufacturing locally is important to reduce import dependencies and boost the Indian economy. Even villages like Rampur are turning to solar power, demonstrating the widespread potential.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain. Land acquisition for large-scale projects can be difficult.
