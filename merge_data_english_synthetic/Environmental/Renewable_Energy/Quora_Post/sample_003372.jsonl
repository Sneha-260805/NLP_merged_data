{"unnormalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish themselves. Think sunlight, wind, water, and the Earth's heat. Unlike fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), which are finite and contribute heavily to pollution, renewable sources offer a cleaner, sustainable alternative for powering our homes, industries, and transportation.", "normalised": "simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish themselves. think sunlight, wind, water, and the earth's heat. unlike fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), which are finite and contribute heavily to pollution, renewable sources offer a cleaner, sustainable alternative for powering our homes, industries, and transportation."}

{"unnormalised": "Currently, solar and wind energy are the most widely adopted renewable sources. However, hydroelectric power (especially in Himalayan regions), biomass (using agricultural waste like rice husk), and geothermal energy are also gaining traction. Rooftop solar panels are becoming increasingly popular, with many households installing them to generate electricity, potentially saving Rs. 20,000 annually on electricity bills and reducing their reliance on the grid. Even small steps, like installing solar water heaters in our homes (requiring around 40 sq ft of roof space), can make a difference.", "normalised": "currently, solar and wind energy are the most widely adopted renewable sources. however, hydroelectric power (especially in himalayan regions), biomass (using agricultural waste like rice husk), and geothermal energy are also gaining traction. rooftop solar panels are becoming increasingly popular, with many households installing them to generate electricity, potentially saving rupees twenty thousand annually on electricity bills and reducing their reliance on the grid. even small steps, like installing solar water heaters in our homes (requiring around forty square feet of roof space), can make a difference."}
