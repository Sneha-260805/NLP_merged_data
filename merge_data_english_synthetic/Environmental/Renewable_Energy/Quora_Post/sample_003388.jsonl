{"unnormalised": "The cost of renewable energy has decreased drastically, making it increasingly competitive. For example, the price of solar power has fallen from Rs. 18/unit to around Rs. 2.50/unit over the past decade. Initiatives like the National Solar Mission aim to further accelerate the adoption. A typical rooftop solar panel system requires approximately 100 sq ft and can significantly reduce electricity bills. Ultimately, a diversified approach, combining various renewable energy technologies, is crucial for India to achieve its energy security and environmental goals.", "normalised": "The cost of renewable energy has decreased drastically, making it increasingly competitive.
