{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy is crucial for India's future, addressing both energy security and environmental concerns. Unlike fossil fuels which are finite and contribute significantly to pollution, renewable sources are naturally replenished. Think of solar power in Rajasthan, harnessing the desert sun or wind energy projects along the coast of Tamil Nadu. These are prime examples of renewable energy at work.", "normalised": "Renewable energy is crucial for India's future, addressing both energy security and environmental concerns.

{"unnormalised": "India is actively promoting renewable energy through various initiatives like the National Solar Mission, aiming to significantly increase solar power generation. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is playing a key role in this transition. The goal is not just about electricity; it's about empowering rural communities. For example, imagine a small village in the Himalayas getting electricity for the first time through a micro-hydro project.", "normalised": "India is actively promoting renewable energy through various initiatives like the National Solar Mission, aiming to significantly increase solar power generation.

{"unnormalised": "Types of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydro (both large and small-scale), biomass, and geothermal. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. While solar is abundant, it is intermittent. Hydro can be reliable, but large dams can have environmental impacts.", "normalised": "Types of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydro (both large and small-scale), biomass, and geothermal.

However, long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. Looking ahead, integrating renewable energy into the grid is crucial. Also, research and development are essential for further innovation. Imagine cheaper and more efficient solar panels being developed in IIT Bombay, making renewable energy even more accessible. Remember, on 15/08/1947, India embarked on its journey as an independent nation. Today, on 09/05/2024, at 09:00 hrs, we must recommit to a sustainable energy future. India aims for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, a testament to its ambition. Remember the evening aartis on the ghats of Varanasi, powered by the very rivers we seek to protect through sustainable energy solutions.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, of course.
