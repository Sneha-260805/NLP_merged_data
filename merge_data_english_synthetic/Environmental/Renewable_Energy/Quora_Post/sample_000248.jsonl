{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from naturally replenishing sources, like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), these resources are sustainable and won't run out. Switching to renewables is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring a cleaner environment for future generations.", "normalised": "Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from naturally replenishing sources, like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat.

{"unnormalised": "India, with its diverse climate and abundant sunlight, has immense potential for renewable energy. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, launched years ago, aimed to significantly increase solar power generation. Today, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat are leading the charge in solar and wind energy production. India aims for significant renewable energy capacity additions by 2030.", "normalised": "India, with its diverse climate and abundant sunlight, has immense potential for renewable energy.

The initial investment (say, Rs. 2,00,000) might seem significant, but the long-term savings and environmental benefits are substantial. The government often provides subsidies and incentives to promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies.", "normalised": "For instance, rooftop solar installations are becoming increasingly popular, allowing homeowners to generate their own electricity.

Imagine a future where every household in a village near the Ganges relies on solar power, switching on their lights promptly at 19:00 hrs, powered by the sun harnessed during the day. Let's aim for this future. Join workshops, learn more, and support businesses committed to sustainability. Many webinars are scheduled on renewable energy at IIT Kanpur starting 10/10/2024 at 09:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, headquartered in India, further demonstrate our commitment to global renewable energy cooperation.
