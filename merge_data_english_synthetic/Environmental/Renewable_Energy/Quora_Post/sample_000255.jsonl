{"unnormalised": "The long-term benefits are undeniable. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will improve air quality, mitigate climate change impacts, and enhance energy independence. Remember that India gained its independence on 15/08/1947, and now we can liberate ourselves from energy dependency. It is crucial to remember that we had a deadline of 09:00 hrs on 26/01/1950 for our constitution to come into effect, similarly, we must set deadlines for our renewable energy targets too. Let’s ensure a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous future for generations to come, inspired by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, who championed self-sufficiency. Also, projects must finish before, say, 31/12/2024.", "normalised": "The long-term benefits are undeniable.
