{"unnormalised": "Firstly, **high upfront costs** pose a significant challenge. Setting up solar parks in Rajasthan or wind farms in Tamil Nadu requires substantial initial investment (Rs. in crores). While the long-term operating costs are lower, many small businesses and individuals find it difficult to make that initial plunge. Government subsidies help, but more innovative financing models are needed.", "normalised": "Firstly, **high upfront costs** pose a significant challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, **intermittency** is a major issue. Solar energy is only available during daylight hours, and wind power fluctuates depending on weather conditions. This means we need robust energy storage solutions like batteries, or smarter grid infrastructure that can handle these fluctuations, potentially involving large scale pumped hydro projects near the Himalayas.", "normalised": "Secondly, **intermittency** is a major issue.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, **land acquisition** can be a lengthy and complex process, especially in densely populated areas. Finding suitable locations for large-scale renewable energy projects, like a 100 sq ft solar panel setup for a housing society in Mumbai, often involves navigating bureaucratic hurdles and addressing concerns of local communities. The \"right to way\" for power lines is also crucial.", "normalised": "Thirdly, **land acquisition** can be a lengthy and complex process, especially in densely populated areas.
