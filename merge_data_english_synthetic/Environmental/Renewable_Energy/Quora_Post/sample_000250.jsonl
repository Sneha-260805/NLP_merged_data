{"unnormalised": "In simple terms, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished – unlike fossil fuels which are finite. Think sunlight, wind, water, and the Earth's own heat. These sources offer a cleaner alternative to traditional power generation, reducing air pollution and our reliance on imports.", "normalised": "In simple terms, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished – unlike fossil fuels which are finite.

Solar-powered irrigation pumps are helping farmers like Ramesh in Maharashtra, improve crop yields, and reduce their dependence on erratic power supply. Micro-hydro projects bring electricity to remote Himalayan villages, previously reliant on kerosene lamps.", "normalised": "Beyond large scale projects, renewable energy is also impacting rural communities.

{"unnormalised": "On 15/08/1947, India embarked on its journey as an independent nation. Today, building a sustainable future through renewable energy is equally important. Companies like Tata Power Solar are playing a key role. Imagine a scenario where power cuts during peak summer (14:00 hrs) in Delhi become a thing of the past, thanks to a robust renewable energy grid! The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras is also at the forefront of research into new and efficient renewable energy technologies. On 01/01/2024, new guidelines related to rooftop solar installations were implemented. The goal is to ensure a greener, cleaner India for generations to come. Every small step, from individual households adopting solar panels to large corporations investing in wind farms, contributes to this vision.", "normalised": "On fifteenth august nineteen forty seven, India embarked on its journey as an independent nation.
