{"unnormalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources don't get depleted, making them a sustainable long-term solution for our energy needs.", "normalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat.

States like Rajasthan are leading the way with massive solar installations covering thousands of sq ft. We're seeing initiatives like the Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) scheme, which aims to provide energy security to farmers while promoting solar power generation.", "normalised": "India has made significant strides in this sector.
