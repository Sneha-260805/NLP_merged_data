{"unnormalised": "India faces unique environmental challenges, and renewable energy offers a path to sustainable development. Solar energy is arguably the most promising. Rajasthan, for instance, has immense solar potential due to its arid climate and abundant sunlight. The Bhadla Solar Park, one of the largest in the world, exemplifies this.", "normalised": "India faces unique environmental challenges, and renewable energy offers a path to sustainable development.
