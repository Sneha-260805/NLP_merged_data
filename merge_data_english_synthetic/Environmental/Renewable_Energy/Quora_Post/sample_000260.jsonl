{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity by 2030. Meeting these goals requires coordinated efforts from government bodies, private sector players like Tata Power, and research institutions like IIT Delhi. The transition also requires public awareness campaigns, explaining the benefits of renewable energy and promoting energy conservation. Remember, even small changes like switching to LED bulbs can contribute to a larger impact. The deadline for many government subsidies on solar panel installations was initially 31/03/2024, but extensions are being discussed.", "normalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity by two thousand and thirty.
