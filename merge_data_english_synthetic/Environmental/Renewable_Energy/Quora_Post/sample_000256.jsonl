{"unnormalised": "India, with its abundant sunshine and lengthy coastline, has immense potential in solar and wind energy. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, launched in 2010, aimed to significantly increase solar power generation. Furthermore, states like Rajasthan and Gujarat have become hubs for large-scale solar and wind farms. The Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan, spanning over 14,000 acres (approx. 60.7 sq km), is a testament to this progress.", "normalised": "India, with its abundant sunshine and lengthy coastline, has immense potential in solar and wind energy.
