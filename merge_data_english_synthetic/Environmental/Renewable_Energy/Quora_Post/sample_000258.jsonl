{"unnormalised": "Dr. Anil Kumar, a leading researcher at IIT-Delhi, notes that the cost of solar power generation has decreased dramatically, making it competitive with traditional fossil fuels. Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are leading states in solar power generation, with vast tracts of land dedicated to solar farms. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has played a vital role in this progress. Wind energy is also gaining momentum, especially in coastal regions.", "normalised": "Doctor Anil Kumar, a leading researcher at I I T-Delhi, notes that the cost of solar power generation has decreased dramatically, making it competitive with traditional fossil fuels.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Land acquisition for renewable energy projects can be difficult and time-consuming, especially in densely populated areas like West Bengal. Storage solutions, such as battery technology, are still expensive, hindering the reliable supply of renewable energy 24/7. The intermittency of solar and wind power requires grid stabilization efforts and investment in smart grid technologies. Furthermore, the dependence on imported components, especially solar panels, needs to be addressed through indigenous manufacturing.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Financing also remains a significant hurdle. Banks are often hesitant to fund large-scale renewable energy projects, requiring innovative financial instruments and government support. Ultimately, a coordinated effort involving government, industry, and research institutions is crucial for India to achieve its renewable energy targets and transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. Consider the recent project in Karnataka requiring around 50,000 sq ft of land, which faced significant local resistance. Even though the return was projected to be Rs. 10 Crores annually, convincing the farmers to give up their land proved immensely difficult.", "normalised": "Financing also remains a significant hurdle.
