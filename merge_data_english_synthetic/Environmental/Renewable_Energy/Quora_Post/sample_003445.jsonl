{"unnormalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, unlike fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. Think sunlight, wind, flowing water, and even the Earth's own heat! This makes it a *sustainable* source of energy, meaning we can use it without running out of it.", "normalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, unlike fossil fuels like coal and petroleum.

{"unnormalised": "India has immense potential for renewable energy. We have abundant sunshine perfect for solar power. Imagine powering entire housing societies, like the ones in Gurgaon, with solar panels on their roofs – reducing electricity bills and carbon footprint! Wind energy farms are already dotting the landscapes of states like Tamil Nadu, generating significant electricity. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam championed the cause of sustainable development and energy independence for India; following his vision means investing heavily in these sources.", "normalised": "India has immense potential for renewable energy.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are numerous: reduced pollution (leading to better air quality, especially in Delhi), energy independence (decreasing reliance on imported fossil fuels and saving precious Rs.), and job creation in the green energy sector. Plus, imagine the impact of providing reliable electricity to rural areas using localized renewable energy sources, powering homes and small businesses on, say, 500 sq ft solar arrays.", "normalised": "The benefits are numerous: reduced pollution (leading to better air quality, especially in Delhi), energy independence (decreasing reliance on imported fossil fuels and saving precious rupees), and job creation in the green energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "It’s not a perfect solution, of course. Renewable energy sources can be intermittent (solar doesn't work at night, wind isn't always blowing) and require infrastructure development. But with advancements in battery storage and smart grid technologies, we can overcome these challenges and pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future for generations to come. Organizations like TERI are leading the charge in research and development in this vital field.", "normalised": "It’s not a perfect solution, of course.
