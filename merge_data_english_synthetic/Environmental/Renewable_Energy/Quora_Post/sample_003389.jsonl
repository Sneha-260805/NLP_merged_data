Considering our challenges like land scarcity and seasonal monsoons, some solutions show real promise.", "normalised": "Solar power, particularly rooftop solar installations, is gaining traction. Imagine transforming vast areas of unused rooftop space in cities like Mumbai and Delhi into clean energy generators. Doctor Sharma at I I T Madras is researching innovative solar cell materials to improve efficiency, even under cloudy conditions. The government's initiatives offering subsidies, like for installing solar panels on homes, are helping to lower the initial costs, which can be a barrier. For example, a typical one thousand square feet rooftop could potentially host enough panels to offset a significant portion of a household's electricity bill, saving them rupee twenty thousand or more annually."}

Land acquisition for large-scale solar farms can be difficult, and energy storage solutions are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, ensuring consistent energy supply during monsoon season requires a diversified approach, including exploring biogas and small hydro projects in suitable regions like Himachal Pradesh. Successfully implementing these solutions requires robust policy support, technological advancements, and public awareness campaigns. Ultimately, India's energy security and environmental well-being depend on embracing a diverse portfolio of renewable energy sources."}
