Imagine a future powered by clean energy, reducing our dependence on coal (which, let's be honest, contributes heavily to pollution in cities like Kanpur). Plus, initiatives like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission are pushing for more widespread adoption. Think of the employment opportunities created too, especially in rural areas!", "normalised": "I mean, on one hand, it's fantastic! imagine a future powered by clean energy, reducing our dependence on coal (which, let's be honest, contributes heavily to pollution in cities like Kanpur). plus, initiatives like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission are pushing for more widespread adoption. think of the employment opportunities created too, especially in rural areas!"}
{"unnormalised": "However, the initial investment can be pretty hefty. Not everyone can afford solar panels, even with government subsidies. And what about the environmental impact of manufacturing these technologies and disposing of them after their lifespan (approx. 25 years)? Furthermore, the reliability of renewable sources like solar is dependent on weather conditions, like those unpredictable monsoons.
