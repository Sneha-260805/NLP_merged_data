{"unnormalised": "However, challenges persist. Land acquisition for large-scale projects, grid integration issues, and the intermittency of renewable sources pose significant hurdles. Storage solutions, especially for solar power after 18:00 hrs, need improvement. Financial constraints and the high initial costs of some technologies also impede progress. Ensuring affordable and reliable power for all, from urban centres like Mumbai to rural villages, requires sustained effort and strategic investment. The nation observes Republic Day on 26/01 annually, a reminder of our commitment to progress and development, which includes a focus on a greener future. Further, delays in project approvals after submitting applications at 09:00 hrs can discourage private investment.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.
