{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished, unlike fossil fuels which are finite. Think solar power, wind energy, hydropower, and biomass. These sources are considered \"renewable\" because they are either constantly available (like sunlight) or can be replenished within a human lifespan.", "normalised": "Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished, unlike fossil fuels which are finite.

{"unnormalised": "Consider rooftop solar panels; even a small installation of around 1000 sq ft can drastically reduce your electricity bill and contribute to a cleaner environment. Imagine the collective impact if even a fraction of Indian households adopted this! The cost of setting up such a system might be around Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh, but the long-term savings and environmental benefits are immense.", "normalised": "Consider rooftop solar panels; even a small installation of around one thousand square feet can drastically reduce your electricity bill and contribute to a cleaner environment.
