Unlike coal or oil, we're not digging into the Earth and depleting resources. Think of it as Akshay Kumar in a Bollywood film – unstoppable and always recharging! Remember the movie \"Toilet: Ek Prem Katha\"? It highlighted the lack of sanitation in rural India. Renewable energy, especially solar, can bring power to remote villages, lighting homes and fueling small businesses, just like sanitation brings dignity.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, like solar, wind, and hydro (water), is basically energy that comes from sources that naturally replenish themselves.
