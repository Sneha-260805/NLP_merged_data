It's all happening, folks! And it's crucial for a country like ours. Remember, we're aiming for net-zero emissions by 2070, a huge goal announced during COP26.", "normalised": "We're talking solar panels blazing bright on rooftops in Rajasthan, wind turbines spinning merrily near the coast of Tamil Nadu, and even hydroelectric projects harnessing the power of our mighty Himalayan rivers.

{"unnormalised": "But why is renewable energy so vital, especially for us in India? Well, consider the air quality in Delhi around Diwali. Choking, right? Reliance on fossil fuels is a big part of that. Shifting to cleaner energy sources can dramatically improve air quality, benefitting public health and making our cities more livable. Plus, it’s becoming increasingly affordable. I read an article the other day mentioning solar power costs have plummeted since 2010 – making it a real contender for even rural households. Even small villages are adopting solar power, and it’s transforming lives! Imagine the impact on villages that previously only had electricity a few hours a day, now running businesses and studying even at 10 PM.", "normalised": "But why is renewable energy so vital, especially for us in India?
