{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Let's talk about something super important – renewable energy. As Indians, we deeply respect nature, and embracing renewable energy is a natural extension of that respect. It's all about tapping into resources that constantly replenish themselves, like sunlight, wind, and water, instead of relying on fossil fuels that are, well, running out and contributing to pollution.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it. India is blessed with sunshine almost year-round. Solar panels on rooftops, like the ones Sharmaji installed in his Jaipur home on 26/01/2023, can generate electricity and significantly reduce your dependence on the grid. Imagine the savings! Plus, the government offers subsidies to encourage folks to go solar. I heard a rumour that a solar plant of 50 MW near Jodhpur is under construction. That's a lot of green power!", "normalised": "Think about it. India is blessed with sunshine almost year-round.

They're not just pretty; they’re converting wind power into electricity. A project started in Tamil Nadu back in 2015 is still churning out clean energy.", "normalised": "Then there's wind energy.

While there are debates about the environmental impact of large dams, smaller-scale hydropower projects can be a sustainable option.", "normalised": "And let’s not forget hydropower.

{"unnormalised": "Switching to renewable energy isn't just good for the environment; it's also good for the economy. It creates jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. It can also make our villages more self-sufficient and less dependent on centralized power grids.
