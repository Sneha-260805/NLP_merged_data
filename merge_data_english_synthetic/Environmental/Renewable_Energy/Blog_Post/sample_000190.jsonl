{"unnormalised": "What exactly constitutes renewable energy? Think of solar power harvested from the Rajasthan desert, wind farms dotting the Tamil Nadu coastline, or hydroelectric projects harnessing the power of the mighty Ganges. Solar energy utilizes photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, powering homes, businesses, and even large-scale solar parks. Wind energy employs turbines to capture the kinetic energy of the wind, generating electricity efficiently. Hydropower relies on the flow of water to turn turbines, generating a continuous source of power.", "normalised": "What exactly constitutes renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming for significant capacity additions in the coming years. Various initiatives, including subsidies and incentives, are encouraging individuals and businesses to adopt renewable energy solutions. Rooftop solar installations, covering thousands of sq ft, are becoming increasingly common across urban India, helping homeowners reduce their electricity bills and contribute to a greener future. Even villages in remote areas, previously reliant on kerosene lamps, are now being powered by solar microgrids.", "normalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming for significant capacity additions in the coming years.
