{"unnormalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that replenish naturally and are virtually inexhaustible. Unlike fossil fuels like coal and petroleum, which release harmful greenhouse gases when burned, renewable energy sources have a significantly lower environmental footprint. Think of the sun, wind, water, and even the Earth’s internal heat – all providing clean and sustainable power.", "normalised": "Simply put, renewable energy comes from sources that replenish naturally and are virtually inexhaustible.

{"unnormalised": "India is blessed with abundant sunshine, making solar energy a particularly promising option. From large-scale solar parks in Rajasthan to rooftop solar installations in Mumbai apartments, solar power is becoming increasingly accessible. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission aims to increase solar power capacity to 100 GW by 2022 (although this target faced some setbacks). Wind energy is another key player. Coastal regions like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are harnessing the power of the wind with impressive wind farms. India is also exploring hydropower potential, particularly in the Himalayan regions. Small-scale hydropower projects are helping electrify remote villages, bringing light and opportunity to areas far from the grid.", "normalised": "India is blessed with abundant sunshine, making solar energy a particularly promising option.

{"unnormalised": "The advantages are manifold. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels not only combats climate change but also improves air quality, a major concern in many Indian cities. Furthermore, investing in renewable energy creates jobs and boosts local economies. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is actively promoting various renewable energy initiatives through subsidies, incentives, and research programs. For instance, farmers can install solar pumps for irrigation, saving on diesel costs and reducing emissions. Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi is leading research on more efficient solar panels and battery storage solutions.", "normalised": "The advantages are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, challenges remain. Renewable energy sources can be intermittent – the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. This requires investment in energy storage solutions and smart grids to ensure a reliable power supply. Land acquisition for large-scale projects can also be a hurdle. However, with innovation, government support, and public awareness, India can unlock the full potential of renewable energy and pave the way for a greener, more sustainable future. Even a small solar water heater on a rooftop occupying just 100 sq ft can make a difference. With costs steadily declining (some solar projects now cost less than Rs. 3/unit), renewable energy is no longer just an environmental imperative; it's an economic opportunity. Let’s embrace this \"Surya Shakti\" and build a brighter tomorrow!", "normalised": "Of course, challenges remain.
