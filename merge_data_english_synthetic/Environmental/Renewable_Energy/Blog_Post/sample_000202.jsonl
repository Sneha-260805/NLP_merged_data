{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Let’s chat about something super important: renewable energy. You know, things like solar power, wind energy, and even that cool hydroelectric power they harness up in places like the Himalayas. With all the talk about climate change, it's become crystal clear we need to seriously ditch fossil fuels, and quick!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it – India is blessed with sunshine practically year-round. Imagine tapping into that resource on a massive scale! Remember that scene in the movie \"Swades\" where Shah Rukh Khan’s character helps electrify a village? That’s the kind of impactful change we can achieve. And it’s not just feel-good stuff, it makes economic sense too. The cost of solar panels has plummeted in recent years, making it a viable option for even rural communities.", "normalised": "Think about it – India is blessed with sunshine practically year-round.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. We need to figure out better ways to store energy – think batteries and pumped hydro. And we need to invest heavily in infrastructure to transmit renewable energy from where it's generated to where it's needed. Also, initial investment is usually on the higher side. Setting up a solar farm can initially cost Rs. 5-6 crore per MW.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Support policies that promote renewable energy. Educate ourselves and others about the benefits. And even consider making small changes in our own lives, like installing solar panels on our roofs or using energy-efficient appliances. Let's all contribute towards a \"Swades\"-like future fueled by the sun, wind, and water! We need to traverse many km to get there, but the end result is worth it. Jai Hind!", "normalised": "So, what can we do? Support policies that promote renewable energy. Educate ourselves and others about the benefits.
