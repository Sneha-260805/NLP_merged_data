{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? Simply put, it's energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. Think sunshine, wind, water, and even the earth's internal heat. Unlike coal or petroleum, these resources won't run out.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "India boasts immense potential for renewable energy generation. Solar power, particularly in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, is booming. Imagine the vast deserts dotted with solar farms, powering millions of homes! Wind energy is also gaining traction, especially along the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu. Hydropower, utilizing India's mighty rivers like the Ganga and Brahmaputra, contributes significantly, although we must ensure sustainable practices to minimize environmental impact.", "normalised": "India boasts immense potential for renewable energy generation.

Abdul Kalam, a strong advocate for rural development, championed the use of biomass gasifiers for village electrification. Small-scale hydro projects, utilizing smaller rivers and streams, also play a crucial role in remote areas.", "normalised": "Beyond these, biomass energy, using agricultural waste and forest residues, provides rural communities with clean cooking fuel and electricity.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming to generate 500 GW by 2030. Initiatives like the National Solar Mission and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) are driving this growth. Financial incentives, such as subsidies and tax breaks, make renewable energy installations more accessible for businesses and individuals. A rooftop solar panel system can potentially save a homeowner Rs. 20,000 per year on their electricity bill, while utilizing around 200 sq ft of roof space.", "normalised": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment, aiming to generate five hundred gigawatts by two thousand and thirty.
