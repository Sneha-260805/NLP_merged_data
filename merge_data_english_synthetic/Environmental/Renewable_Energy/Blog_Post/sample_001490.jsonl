Solar panels are becoming increasingly affordable, thanks to initiatives by MNRE and institutions like IIT Bombay. Imagine entire villages powered by solar, reducing dependence on traditional power grids!

Of course, large dam projects have their own environmental concerns, so we need to be smart about how we implement them.
