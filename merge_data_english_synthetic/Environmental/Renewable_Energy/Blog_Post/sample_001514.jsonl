Imagine those sprawling deserts, not just shimmering with heat, but powering homes and industries. Instead of relying solely on coal-fired power plants that belch out pollutants (like the ones near my hometown, Kanpur!), we could be harnessing the sun's energy.", "normalised": "Think about it.

We've already got some great examples, like the Koyna Dam in Maharashtra, but we can do so much more. I read an article the other day – on 26/01/2023, actually – saying that India aims to generate 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030! That’s a massive leap!", "normalised": "Plus, remember those monsoon rains we all complain about? That water can be channeled into hydroelectric power!

Imagine every household in Delhi, from Connaught Place to Chittaranjan Park, generating its own electricity. That would seriously reduce the load on the grid. And what about wind power?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Renewable energy infrastructure can be expensive upfront, and sometimes, the technology can be unreliable. Plus, figuring out storage solutions for when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing is crucial.
