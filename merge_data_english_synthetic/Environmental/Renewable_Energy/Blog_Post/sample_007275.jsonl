{"unnormalised": "Seriously, India is sitting on a gold mine (or should I say, a sunshine mine?) when it comes to renewable energy potential. Rajasthan, for example, gets an incredible amount of sunlight – perfect for solar farms. Imagine the possibilities if we could truly harness that energy! Places like Gujarat, with its long coastline, have fantastic potential for wind energy too. Remember the Bhuj earthquake back in 2001? Rebuilding with green technologies should've been a priority then!", "normalised": "Seriously, India is sitting on a gold mine (or should I say, a sunshine mine?) when it comes to renewable energy potential.
