My cousin, Priya, in Chennai did it last year (around 23/07/2023) and she's already seeing a significant reduction in her electricity bill. Plus, she feels good knowing she's doing her bit for the environment. That feel-good factor is priceless!", "normalised": "But it is not just about the massive projects.
