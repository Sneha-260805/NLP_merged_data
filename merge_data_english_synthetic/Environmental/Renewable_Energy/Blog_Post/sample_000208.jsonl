But India, with its abundant sunshine and wind, has a massive opportunity to become a leader in renewable energy. Imagine vast solar farms in Rajasthan, harnessing the power of the desert sun. Or wind turbines spinning gracefully in the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu. It's a beautiful vision, isn't it?", "normalised": "Think about it.
