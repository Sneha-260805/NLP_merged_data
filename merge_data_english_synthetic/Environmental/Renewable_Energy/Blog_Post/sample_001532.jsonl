These are all incredible, readily available sources of clean energy! Instead of relying solely on fossil fuels that pollute our air and contribute to climate change, we can tap into these natural resources.", "normalised": "Think about it.

Now, you see solar panels popping up everywhere, from rooftops in Delhi to large-scale solar farms in Gujarat.
