{"unnormalised": "India, with its vibrant culture and booming economy, faces a HUGE energy demand. We need power for everything from running our ACs in Chennai’s scorching heat to keeping the lights on in a remote village near the Himalayas. And let's be honest, relying solely on fossil fuels just isn’t sustainable. It's like burning through all your savings – feels good for a bit, but you’re left with nothing in the long run.", "normalised": "India, with its vibrant culture and booming economy, faces a huge energy demand.
