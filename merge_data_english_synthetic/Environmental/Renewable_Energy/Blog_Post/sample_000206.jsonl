We all know the planet is getting warmer than a samosa straight out of the fryer, and a big part of that is how we generate electricity. Think about it – those coal-fired power plants near places like Dhanbad aren't exactly doing wonders for the environment, are they?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, let's talk about something super important: renewable energy!
