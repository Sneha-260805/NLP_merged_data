{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, quite simply, is energy derived from sources that are naturally replenished, like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute heavily to pollution, these sources are virtually inexhaustible.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, quite simply, is energy derived from sources that are naturally replenished, like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond solar, wind energy is a well-established renewable energy source in India. Wind farms dot the landscapes of states like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Hydroelectric projects, while sometimes facing environmental concerns, also contribute a substantial share of India's renewable energy mix. Biogas, derived from agricultural waste and animal dung, offers a sustainable cooking fuel solution, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "Beyond solar, wind energy is a well-established renewable energy source in India.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are manifold. Reduced air pollution improves public health, especially in cities like Delhi. Reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels strengthens energy security. Creation of new jobs in the renewable energy sector boosts economic growth.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, challenges remain. High initial investment costs, intermittency of some renewable sources (like solar and wind), and land acquisition issues need to be addressed. However, with supportive government policies, technological advancements, and growing public awareness, renewable energy is undoubtedly the pathway to a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future for India. Think 100 GW of solar by 2022, imagine where we'll be in 2030!", "normalised": "Of course, challenges remain.
