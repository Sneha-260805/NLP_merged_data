The Government of India has the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme to help farmers install solar pumps and sell excess power back to the grid. Pretty cool, right?

We have the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) in Chennai doing some fantastic research to improve turbine efficiency.
