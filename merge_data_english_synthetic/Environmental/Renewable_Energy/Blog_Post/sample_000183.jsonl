From rooftop solar panels in Mumbai apartments to large-scale solar parks like the Bhadla Solar Park, India is steadily increasing its solar capacity. Remember 15/08/1947, Independence Day? Let’s strive for energy independence too!", "normalised": "Solar energy, harnessed through photovoltaic P V cells, is becoming increasingly affordable and accessible.

Imagine converting crop residue in Punjab into biogas for cooking and electricity generation. This can drastically reduce reliance on fossil fuels and improve air quality.", "normalised": "Biomass, derived from organic matter such as agricultural waste and forestry residues, offers a localized and sustainable energy solution, particularly in rural areas.

{"unnormalised": "India's commitment to renewable energy is not just an environmental imperative, but also an economic opportunity. By investing in research and development, creating jobs, and promoting domestic manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, we can build a stronger and more sustainable economy. The Prime Minister recently stated the importance of renewable energy at the 09:00 hrs address on 26/01/2023. Consider attending the upcoming renewable energy seminar at IIT Delhi on 30/09/2024 to learn more and contribute to this vital transition.", "normalised": "India's commitment to renewable energy is not just an environmental imperative, but also an economic opportunity.
