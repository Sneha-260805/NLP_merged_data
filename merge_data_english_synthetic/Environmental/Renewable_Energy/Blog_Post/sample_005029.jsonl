The good news is, things are changing, and India is making a serious push towards renewable energy. Think solar panels glinting in the Rajasthan sun, wind turbines spinning in the Tamil Nadu breeze, and even harnessing energy from the mighty Ganga – it's all happening!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Why is this so important? Well, for starters, it’s way better for the environment. Burning fossil fuels releases pollutants that contribute to climate change and make cities like Mumbai and Kolkata choke with smog. Renewable energy, on the other hand, is cleaner and helps us reduce our carbon footprint. Imagine cleaner air, healthier communities, and a more sustainable future for our kids. Diwali celebrations without the smog, perhaps? A distant dream, but a worthy one!", "normalised": "Why is this so important? Well, for starters, it is way better for the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Plus, renewable energy can also boost our economy. Think of the jobs created in manufacturing, installing, and maintaining solar panels and wind turbines. Institutions like IIT Madras are doing groundbreaking research in this area, developing innovative technologies to make renewable energy even more efficient and affordable. My friend, Priya, actually works on developing more efficient solar cells – pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Plus, renewable energy can also boost our economy.

{"unnormalised": "It's not all smooth sailing, of course. There are challenges with storage, grid infrastructure, and ensuring affordability for everyone, especially in rural areas like my nanaji's village near Lucknow. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) are crucial to address these issues. This scheme aims to help farmers install solar pumps and generate their own electricity – a true game-changer!", "normalised": "It is not all smooth sailing, of course.

Whether it's investing in rooftop solar panels, supporting policies that promote renewable energy, or simply being more conscious of our energy consumption, every little bit helps. Think about switching off lights at 10:00 PM sharp, because that is the time my Ajji goes to bed. Let's aim for a greener India, one solar panel, one wind turbine, and one conscious choice at a time. Let's remember that on 26/01/1950, we became a republic, and now we can create a truly green republic! And circle back to discussing more on 15/08/2024!", "normalised": "The time is N O W.
