{"unnormalised": "Solar power, particularly in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, holds immense potential. Vast expanses of land are ideally suited for solar farms, generating electricity and creating employment opportunities for local communities. Wind energy also plays a significant role, with wind farms dotting the coastlines of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The Jaisalmer Wind Park, spanning over 1,600 sq ft, is a testament to India's commitment to wind power.", "normalised": "solar power, particularly in states like rajasthan and gujarat, holds immense potential. vast expanses of land are ideally suited for solar farms, generating electricity and creating employment opportunities for local communities. wind energy also plays a significant role, with wind farms dotting the coastlines of tamil nadu and maharashtra. the jaisalmer wind park, spanning over one thousand six hundred square feet, is a testament to india's commitment to wind power."}

{"unnormalised": "The transition to renewable energy requires a concerted effort from the government, industry, and individuals. It's not merely about installing solar panels or wind turbines; it's about embracing a new mindset that prioritizes environmental sustainability. The cost can range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5 Lakhs for a decent home solar system. India’s future depends on it, and the time to act is now. Let us illuminate our nation with clean, renewable power.", "normalised": "the transition to renewable energy requires a concerted effort from the government, industry, and individuals. it's not merely about installing solar panels or wind turbines; it's about embracing a new mindset that prioritizes environmental sustainability. the cost can range from rupee fifty thousand to rupee five lakh for a decent home solar system. india’s future depends on it, and the time to act is now. let us illuminate our nation with clean, renewable power."}
