We all love our chai in the morning and keeping cool with the AC in this Chennai heat, but traditional energy sources are taking a toll on our planet. Think polluted air, melting glaciers, and more extreme weather events than ever before. It's time for a change, and that change is renewable energy.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? Well, it’s energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished, like sunlight, wind, and water. Imagine harnessing the power of the sun with solar panels on your roof, just like Sharmaji down the street! Or picture huge wind turbines spinning in Rajasthan, converting the wind into electricity.

And now, initiatives like PM-KUSUM are helping farmers generate their own solar power. We've got companies like Tata Power and ReNew Power really pushing the boundaries too. I remember reading about ReNew Power closing a deal on 02/03/2023, a big step!", "normalised": "India is making some serious progress in this area.

{"unnormalised": "Why should you care? For starters, renewable energy is much cleaner. Less pollution means better air quality for everyone, especially in crowded cities like Delhi. Plus, it helps reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which often come with geopolitical complications and price fluctuations.

{"unnormalised": "But it’s not just about the environment. Renewable energy can also create jobs. From installing solar panels in villages to manufacturing wind turbine blades in factories, there are tons of opportunities. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi is even doing some amazing research on energy storage, so we can use renewable energy even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.", "normalised": "But it’s not just about the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Setting up large-scale renewable energy projects requires significant investment. Transmission infrastructure needs upgrading too. And making sure the energy supply is consistent can be tricky. We aim to have 50% of energy from renewable sources by 2030 - quite a target! A friend working in this sector told me at 16:00 hrs just yesterday that costs are definitely coming down.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.
