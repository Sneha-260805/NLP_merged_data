We've got folks at institutions like IIT Bombay working tirelessly on improving solar cell efficiency, and companies are setting up huge solar parks, like the one in Bhadla, Rajasthan. We even have individuals like Arun Sharma, a farmer in Punjab, using solar pumps to irrigate his fields – talk about empowering! He told me he saved around Rs. 5000 per month on electricity bills!", "normalised": "India has been making some serious strides in this area.
