{"unnormalised": "Solar power is rapidly gaining traction, particularly in states like Rajasthan, where vast stretches of arid land provide ideal conditions for large-scale solar farms. Initiatives like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) have played a significant role in driving down the cost of solar energy, making it increasingly competitive with traditional sources. The potential is immense, with estimates suggesting India could generate several hundred GWs from solar energy alone.", "normalised": "Solar power is rapidly gaining traction, particularly in states like Rajasthan, where vast stretches of arid land provide ideal conditions for large-scale solar farms.
