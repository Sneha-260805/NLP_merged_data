{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? Simply put, it's energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. Think sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels like coal and petroleum, these resources are virtually inexhaustible and produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "Wind energy is another vital component. Coastal states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are harnessing the power of the wind with numerous wind farms. Hydroelectric power, a more established renewable energy source, continues to play a critical role.
