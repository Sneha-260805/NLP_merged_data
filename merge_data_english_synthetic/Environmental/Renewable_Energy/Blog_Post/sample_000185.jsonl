Think of the sun, the wind, and flowing water – abundant resources that can be harnessed to power our homes, businesses, and industries.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "Solar energy is perhaps the most visible example. From rooftop solar panels on homes in Delhi to large-scale solar farms in Rajasthan, we're increasingly tapping into the sun's power. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has been instrumental in promoting solar energy adoption across the country. Wind energy is another significant player. Coastal regions like Tamil Nadu are dotted with wind farms, converting wind power into electricity. Hydropower, utilizing the energy of flowing water, has been a long-standing source of electricity, though newer, smaller-scale projects are now focusing on minimizing environmental disruption.", "normalised": "Solar energy is perhaps the most visible example.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond these established sources, India is exploring other promising options. Biomass energy, using agricultural waste and other organic matter, is gaining traction in rural areas. Dr. Sharma at IIT Bombay is conducting cutting-edge research on improving the efficiency of biogas plants. Geothermal energy, harnessing heat from the Earth's interior, is also being investigated, particularly in regions like Himachal Pradesh.", "normalised": "Beyond these established sources, India is exploring other promising options.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of renewable energy are manifold. Firstly, it reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, which contribute significantly to air pollution and climate change. Secondly, it promotes energy security by diversifying our energy sources. Thirdly, it can create new jobs and stimulate economic growth, especially in rural areas. For example, a community-owned solar project can provide electricity to a village and generate income for its residents. Imagine a solar powered community centre of 2000 sq ft, powering lights and computers for the entire village.", "normalised": "The benefits of renewable energy are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, challenges remain. The initial investment costs can be high, and the intermittent nature of some renewable sources (like solar and wind) requires smart grid solutions and energy storage technologies. But with continued innovation, supportive policies, and a growing awareness among citizens, India is well-positioned to become a global leader in renewable energy. The cost of solar panels have dropped from Rs. 20 per unit to Rs. 10 per unit in the last decade and the Govt. is planning new solar plants at a distance of every 50 km on National Highways.", "normalised": "Of course, challenges remain.
