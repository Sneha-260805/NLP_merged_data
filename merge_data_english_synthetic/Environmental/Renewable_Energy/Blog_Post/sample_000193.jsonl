{"unnormalised": "India, a land steeped in tradition and rapidly embracing modernity, faces a critical juncture in its energy trajectory. As our economy surges and our population expands, the demand for power is escalating exponentially. However, this growth cannot come at the expense of our environment. Renewable energy sources offer a viable and increasingly attractive solution to meet our energy needs while mitigating the detrimental effects of climate change.", "normalised": "India, a land steeped in tradition and rapidly embracing modernity, faces a critical juncture in its energy trajectory.

{"unnormalised": "India possesses immense potential for renewable energy generation. The sun beats down relentlessly on Rajasthan, creating vast opportunities for solar power development. The wind howls across the Western Ghats, offering consistent wind energy generation possibilities. From the Himalayan rivers to the coastal regions, hydropower and tidal energy resources are abundant. Harnessing these resources is not merely an environmental imperative, but also an economic opportunity.", "normalised": "India possesses immense potential for renewable energy generation.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government, recognising this potential, has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, launched in 2010, was a pivotal step in promoting solar energy adoption. Institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi are actively engaged in cutting-edge research and development, pushing the boundaries of renewable energy technologies. This R&D is vital for improving efficiency and reducing costs.", "normalised": "The Indian government, recognizing this potential, has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Intermittency, the fluctuating nature of solar and wind power, requires sophisticated grid management solutions. Initial costs can be high, although they are rapidly decreasing. Furthermore, land acquisition for renewable energy projects can be a complex and sensitive issue. Overcoming these hurdles requires innovative policy frameworks, robust investment in infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Just as the characters in the Bollywood film \"Swades\" sought to bring electricity to their village, we must strive to bring clean and sustainable energy to all corners of India. Investing in renewable energy is an investment in our future – a future where economic prosperity and environmental sustainability go hand in hand. With continued commitment and innovation, India can become a global leader in renewable energy, powering a brighter and greener tomorrow. We need more investments, say upwards of Rs. 10,000 Crores, to meet the 2030 targets. Transmission lines of over 5000 km need to be laid. Let us commit to this.", "normalised": "Just as the characters in the Bollywood film \"Swades\" sought to bring electricity to their village, we must strive to bring clean and sustainable energy to all corners of India. Investing in renewable energy is an investment in our future – a future where economic prosperity and environmental sustainability go hand in hand. With continued commitment and innovation, India can become a global leader in renewable energy, powering a brighter and greener tomorrow. We need more investments, say upwards of rupees ten thousand crores, to meet the two thousand and thirty targets. Transmission lines of over five thousand kilometer need to be laid. Let us commit to this."}
