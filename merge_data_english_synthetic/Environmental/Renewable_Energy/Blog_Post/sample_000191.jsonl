{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, derived from naturally replenishing sources, offers a compelling alternative to fossil fuels. Solar energy, for example, is seeing significant adoption across the country. Rooftop solar installations are becoming increasingly common in urban areas, offering homeowners and businesses a way to reduce their carbon footprint and lower their electricity bills. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, noted in a recent seminar that solar energy has the potential to power entire villages, particularly in remote areas lacking grid connectivity.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, derived from naturally replenishing sources, offers a compelling alternative to fossil fuels.

{"unnormalised": "Wind energy is another vital component of India's renewable energy landscape. Large wind farms, like those in Muppandal, Tamil Nadu, contribute significantly to the national grid. Furthermore, the Indian government is actively promoting the development of offshore wind farms to tap into the vast potential of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.", "normalised": "Wind energy is another vital component of India's renewable energy landscape.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of transitioning to renewable energy are multifaceted. It reduces air pollution, mitigates climate change, and enhances energy security. Moreover, the renewable energy sector creates new jobs and stimulates economic growth. Recent estimates suggest that the renewable energy sector in India could create millions of jobs in the coming decades.", "normalised": "The benefits of transitioning to renewable energy are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "While progress has been made, challenges remain. The initial investment costs for renewable energy infrastructure can be substantial. For example, setting up a solar power plant requires significant upfront capital, sometimes in the range of Rs. 50 crores per MW. Land acquisition can also be a hurdle, particularly for large-scale projects requiring vast tracts of land, potentially hundreds of acres or thousands of sq ft.", "normalised": "While progress has been made, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "However, the long-term benefits of renewable energy far outweigh the challenges. As technology advances and costs continue to decrease, renewable energy will become an increasingly affordable and accessible option for India. With continued government support, private sector investment, and public awareness, India can pave the way for a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future. The goal is to achieve a significant percentage of the country's energy needs from renewable sources by 2030, further solidifying India's commitment to environmental stewardship.", "normalised": "However, the long-term benefits of renewable energy far outweigh the challenges.
