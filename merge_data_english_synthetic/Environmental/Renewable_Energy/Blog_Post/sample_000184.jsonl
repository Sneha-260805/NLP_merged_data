{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? It's energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Think solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources don't deplete Earth's finite resources and produce significantly less greenhouse gas emissions.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "Solar power is booming in India. Large-scale solar parks, like the Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan, are transforming the energy landscape. Imagine, harnessing the power of Surya Dev himself! Rooftop solar panels are also becoming increasingly popular for individual households and businesses. The government offers various subsidies and schemes to encourage adoption, pushing us closer to our renewable energy targets. As of 15/08/1947 (India's Independence Day!), our energy mix was heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Now, we're striving for a much greener future.", "normalised": "Solar power is booming in India.

{"unnormalised": "Wind energy also plays a significant role. The Muppandal wind farm in Tamil Nadu is one of the largest in the world. India's long coastline provides ample opportunity to harness the power of the wind. Hydroelectric power, with large dams like the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River, has been a part of India's energy generation for decades.", "normalised": "Wind energy also plays a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "But renewables aren't without their challenges. Intermittency – the fact that solar and wind power fluctuate depending on weather conditions – is a key concern. Energy storage solutions, like batteries, are crucial for ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. Investing in research and development is vital. IIT Bombay and other institutions are actively working on innovative solutions to improve the efficiency and affordability of renewable technologies.", "normalised": "But renewables aren't without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Biomass energy, utilizing agricultural waste and other organic matter, is another promising area, particularly in rural India. Imagine turning paddy straw, often burned after harvest, into a valuable energy source! This not only reduces pollution but also provides economic opportunities for farmers.", "normalised": "Biomass energy, utilizing agricultural waste and other organic matter, is another promising area, particularly in rural India.

{"unnormalised": "India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment. By 2030, we aim to have a significant percentage of our electricity generated from renewable sources. Achieving this will require sustained effort, policy support, and public awareness. Let's all do our part, from switching to energy-efficient appliances to supporting renewable energy initiatives. We must all be awake by 09:00 hrs to hear the good news on the sustainable energy front.", "normalised": "India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy deployment.
