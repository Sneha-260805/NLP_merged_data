{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, like solar, wind, and hydro, is basically energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished. Think of the sun blazing down – that’s a goldmine of potential! India has been making strides, especially with solar power initiatives. Remember the huge solar park in Bhadla, Rajasthan? Crazy impressive, right? It's reducing our reliance on coal and other polluting sources.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, like solar, wind, and hydro, is basically energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you might be thinking: is it really feasible? Well, the cost of solar panels has plummeted in recent years, making it much more affordable for the average Indian family to install rooftop solar. Many companies are offering incentives and easy financing options. Plus, institutions like IIT Delhi are doing amazing research on improving battery technology to store renewable energy, which is crucial for when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you might be thinking: is it really feasible?

Even contributing Rs. 500 to a local renewable energy project is a great start!
