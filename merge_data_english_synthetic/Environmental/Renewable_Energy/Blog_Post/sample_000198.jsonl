{"unnormalised": "Solar power, particularly abundant in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, holds immense potential. Large-scale solar parks are already contributing significantly to the national grid. Wind energy, harnessed along the coastal regions and in states like Tamil Nadu, provides another valuable resource. Hydroelectric power, a long-standing source, continues to play a role, though careful consideration of environmental impacts is essential. Biomass energy, utilizing agricultural waste and other organic materials, offers a decentralized solution, particularly beneficial in rural areas.", "normalised": "Solar power, particularly abundant in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, holds immense potential.

{"unnormalised": "As depicted in the Bollywood film \"Swades,\" rural electrification through renewable sources can transform lives and empower communities. With sustained efforts and a commitment to innovation, India can harness its vast renewable energy resources to achieve energy security, reduce its carbon footprint, and build a more sustainable future for generations to come. The cost of solar panels has fallen drastically in recent years, making it more accessible than ever before. Experts predict further reductions of Rs. 5/unit within the next 5 years. Renewable energy projects in Ladakh, located at high altitudes, are expected to improve the local economy by 20% within 10 km radius.", "normalised": "As depicted in the Bollywood film \"Swades,\" rural electrification through renewable sources can transform lives and empower communities.
