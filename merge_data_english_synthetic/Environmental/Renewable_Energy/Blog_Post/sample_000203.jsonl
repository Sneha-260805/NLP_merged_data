You know, the stuff that keeps our planet happy and healthy, unlike traditional fossil fuels. Think solar panels shimmering in Rajasthan, windmills spinning along the Tamil Nadu coast, and hydroelectric power harnessing the might of the Ganga. It's all happening right here in India.", "normalised": "Hey everyone! Let's talk about something super important and frankly, pretty darn cool: renewable energy.
