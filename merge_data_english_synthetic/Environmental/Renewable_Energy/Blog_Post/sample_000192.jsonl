{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, encompassing solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, presents a viable alternative. Solar energy, particularly relevant in a sun-drenched country like India, holds immense potential. Rajasthan, for instance, has emerged as a hub for solar power generation, boasting some of the largest solar parks in the world. Similarly, wind energy is gaining traction, with states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat leading the way in harnessing its power.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, encompassing solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, presents a viable alternative.
