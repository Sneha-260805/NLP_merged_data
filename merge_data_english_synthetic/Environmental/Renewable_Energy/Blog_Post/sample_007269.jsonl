{"unnormalised": "Renewable energy, simply put, is energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished – like sunlight, wind, water, and the Earth's heat. Think solar panels shimmering on rooftops, wind turbines gracefully turning in the breeze, or hydroelectric power generated by the mighty Ganga. Unlike fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), which are finite and contribute massively to pollution, these sources are practically inexhaustible.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, simply put, is energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished – like sunlight, wind, water, and the Earth's heat.

The government's pushing initiatives like the National Solar Mission, aiming for massive solar power generation by, say, 2030.

It's not just about big projects either; even smaller things like rooftop solar panels in Mumbai or biogas plants in rural Tamil Nadu are making a real difference.

Renewable energy also means less dependence on imported fossil fuels, strengthening our energy security and saving precious Rupees. Plus, it creates tons of new jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. Think of the employment opportunities this can create in places like Bihar!", "normalised": "Why should we care?
