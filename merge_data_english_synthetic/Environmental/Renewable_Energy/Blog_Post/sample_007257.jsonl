Instead of relying on fossil fuels that are running out and costing us an arm and a leg (and contributing to global warming!), we can tap into the sun, the wind, and the water – resources that Mother Nature provides in abundance. Plus, it's creating jobs! From engineers in Bangalore designing the next generation of wind turbines to technicians installing solar panels on homes in Kanpur, renewable energy is a job creator.", "normalised": "Think about it.
