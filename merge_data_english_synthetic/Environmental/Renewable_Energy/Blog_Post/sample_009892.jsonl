Imagine harnessing all that natural power instead of relying solely on traditional sources like coal. Pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly IS renewable energy? Simply put, it’s energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished, like solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. Think of those giant wind turbines you see whizzing around near Jaisalmer, Rajasthan – that’s wind energy in action! Or those solar panels glinting on rooftops in Gujarat.", "normalised": "So, what exactly I S renewable energy?

Burning fossil fuels releases harmful pollutants that contribute to climate change and air pollution, which can affect everything from the monsoon season to the clarity of the air in Delhi. Plus, relying on imported fossil fuels makes us vulnerable to fluctuating global prices. Remember the oil price spike back in 2022? Ouch!", "normalised": "Why should we care?
