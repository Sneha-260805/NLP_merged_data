{"unnormalised": "Think about it – India gets a *lot* of sunshine. Solar power is a no-brainer! I remember back in 2010, when my chacha ji in Rajasthan invested in a small solar panel system for his farm. He was initially skeptical, but now he's saving money and contributing to a cleaner environment. Places like Bhadla Solar Park are truly impressive, massive projects showcasing India's commitment. And it's not just solar. Wind energy is also gaining momentum, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.", "normalised": "think about it dash india gets a lot of sunshine. solar power is a no-brainer exclamation mark i remember back in two thousand and ten, when my chacha ji in rajasthan invested in a small solar panel system for his farm. he was initially skeptical, but now he is saving money and contributing to a cleaner environment. places like bhadla solar park are truly impressive, massive projects showcasing india's commitment. and it is not just solar. wind energy is also gaining momentum, especially in states like tamil nadu and gujarat."}
