{"unnormalised": "Namaste friends! Let's talk about something crucial for our future: renewable energy. You see, relying solely on fossil fuels is like continuously borrowing money – eventually, the debt catches up. With the rising pollution levels in Delhi, especially around Diwali time, and the increasing frequency of floods in Assam, the impact of climate change is becoming undeniably clear. Renewable energy sources offer a much cleaner and sustainable alternative.", "normalised": "Namaste friends! Let's talk about something crucial for our future: renewable energy.

{"unnormalised": "Think of solar power. India, blessed with abundant sunshine, is perfectly positioned to become a solar powerhouse. Villages like Dharnai in Bihar, which were once off the grid, are now thriving thanks to solar microgrids. The Indian government has set ambitious targets for solar energy generation, aiming for a substantial increase by 2030. My cousin, Rohan, is actually working on a solar panel project at IIT Madras – pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Think of solar power.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's wind energy. Coastal states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have significant wind energy potential. Driving down the East Coast Road, you can spot those massive turbines spinning, silently converting wind into electricity. Remember that school trip back in 2010 when we were fascinated by the wind farms near Muppandal? Good times!", "normalised": "Then there's wind energy.

Though big dams can have environmental consequences, smaller, run-of-the-river hydro projects can be a viable option, especially in the Himalayan region.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent – they depend on the weather. We need to invest heavily in energy storage solutions, like batteries, to ensure a consistent supply. Integrating renewable energy into the existing grid infrastructure also requires significant upgrades and planning. The tender deadlines for some new renewable projects have been extended until 17/10/2024, 14:00 hrs due to these issues.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.

{"unnormalised": "But the benefits are immense. Cleaner air, reduced carbon emissions, energy independence, and job creation – renewable energy offers a path towards a brighter, more sustainable future for India. As Mahatma Gandhi said, \"Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.\" Let’s strive to build an India powered by the sun, wind, and water, for generations to come. Maybe by 26/01/2050, we will see an India fully powered by renewable energy! Imagine that! The government is giving subsidies, maybe like Rs. 10,000, to people who install solar panels.", "normalised": "But the benefits are immense.
