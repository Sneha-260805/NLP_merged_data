Wind energy is another big one, especially in places like Rajasthan where the wind whips across the desert. And let’s not forget hydropower. Think of the dams on the Ganges, providing electricity to millions.", "normalised": "So, what are we talking about here? Solar power, of course!

{"unnormalised": "But it's not just up to the government or big institutions. We, the people, have a role to play too! We can install solar panels on our homes, conserve energy, and support businesses that are committed to sustainability. Even small changes, like switching off lights when we leave a room (a habit my Nani drilled into me!), can make a difference. Maybe take that 09:00 hrs Yoga class by the window to reduce your need for artificial lighting!", "normalised": "But it's not just up to the government or big institutions.
