{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? It's energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished, like sunlight, wind, and water. Forget those polluting coal plants! We're talking about solar panels glinting on rooftops in Jaipur, wind turbines spinning gracefully in Tamil Nadu, and hydroelectric projects powering villages nestled in the Himalayas.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

Institutions like IIT Bombay are doing groundbreaking research on solar cell technology, and the government is pushing for ambitious renewable energy targets. We’ve even seen success stories in villages adopting solar power, reducing their reliance on expensive and unreliable electricity grids, saving families around Rs. 1500-2000 per month.", "normalised": "India is actually making strides in this direction.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses. Challenges remain. We need to improve energy storage technology, like better batteries, to make renewable energy more reliable. The upfront cost of installing solar panels can be a barrier for some families. And let's not forget the environmental impact of building large-scale solar farms and wind farms, requiring careful planning to minimize disturbance to ecosystems.", "normalised": "Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses.

{"unnormalised": "But hey, no one said saving the planet would be easy! It's a journey, a \"safar,\" as they say in Hindi. And every little bit helps. So, what can you do? Advocate for policies that support renewable energy. Consider installing solar panels on your own roof (if feasible, of course!). Spread the word and educate others about the benefits of going green. Every step, no matter how small, gets us closer to a cleaner, brighter, and more sustainable future for India.", "normalised": "But hey, no one said saving the planet would be easy!
