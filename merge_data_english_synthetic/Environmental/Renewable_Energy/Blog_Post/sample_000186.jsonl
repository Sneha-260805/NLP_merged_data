{"unnormalised": "What exactly is renewable energy? Simply put, it's energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a rate equal to or faster than their consumption. Think sunlight, wind, water, and even geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels which are finite and contribute heavily to pollution, renewables offer a cleaner and more sustainable path forward.", "normalised": "What exactly is renewable energy?

{"unnormalised": "India's commitment to renewable energy is evident in initiatives like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), aiming to significantly increase solar power generation. States like Rajasthan, with its vast Thar Desert, are becoming hubs for solar farms, covering acres of land with photovoltaic panels. Wind energy is also booming, particularly in coastal areas like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The potential is immense, especially considering India's geographic diversity.", "normalised": "India's commitment to renewable energy is evident in initiatives like the J N N S M, aiming to significantly increase solar power generation.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are manifold. Reduced air pollution, crucial in cities like Delhi struggling with high levels of particulate matter, is a major one. Reliance on imported fossil fuels decreases, bolstering energy independence and saving valuable foreign exchange. New jobs are being created in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, boosting the Indian economy. Rural electrification, providing power to remote villages where access to the grid is limited, is becoming a reality thanks to distributed renewable energy systems.", "normalised": "The benefits are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, challenges remain. Initial investment costs can be high, sometimes in the range of Rs. 50,000 per kW for solar rooftop installations. Energy storage solutions are needed to address the intermittent nature of some renewable sources like wind and solar. Land acquisition for large-scale projects can also face hurdles. Institutes like IIT Bombay are actively researching advanced battery technologies and grid integration solutions to overcome these challenges.", "normalised": "Of course, challenges remain.
