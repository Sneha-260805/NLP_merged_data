We're talking solar power, wind energy, hydro energy, and even biomass energy derived from agricultural waste – think of all that rice straw after the harvest in Punjab! Imagine villages powered entirely by solar panels, like a modern-day interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi's self-sufficient Gram Swaraj concept.", "normalised": "Renewable energy, my friends, isn't just a trendy buzzword; it's a necessity.
