Think of the impact on our beautiful country, from the polluted air in Kanpur to the melting glaciers in the Himalayas. Renewable energy offers a cleaner, greener alternative.

Imagine Rajasthan, bathed in sunshine almost 365 days a year, covered in solar panels generating electricity for the entire nation. Places like the Bhadla Solar Park are already making massive strides. And wind power? India has a vast coastline perfect for wind turbines. Tamil Nadu, for instance, is a major player in wind energy generation.", "normalised": "What exactly are we talking about? Solar power is a big one!

It can create jobs, boost local economies, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Plus, think of the benefits for rural communities!

Even small changes, like switching to energy-efficient appliances or using public transport (especially electric buses!), can make a difference. Let's make a conscious effort to build a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren. Think about it – by 2050, at 03:00 hrs, we could be a nation powered almost entirely by the sun and the wind! Let’s make it happen, folks! Jai Hind!", "normalised": "So, what can we do?
