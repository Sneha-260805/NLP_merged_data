{"unnormalised": "India, a land of diverse landscapes and traditions, boasts immense potential for renewable energy generation. From the sunny plains of Rajasthan to the wind-swept coasts of Tamil Nadu, the country is blessed with abundant resources. Solar energy, in particular, offers a viable alternative to traditional power sources. Projects like the Bhadla Solar Park, one of the largest in the world, demonstrate India's commitment to harnessing this potential. Wind energy also plays a crucial role, with states like Gujarat leading the way in wind farm development.", "normalised": "India, a land of diverse landscapes and traditions, boasts immense potential for renewable energy generation.
