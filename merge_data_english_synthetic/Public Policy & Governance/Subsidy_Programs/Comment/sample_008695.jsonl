Targeted subsidies, like those for fertilizer, need careful evaluation for long-term environmental sustainability. The effectiveness should be measured against indicators such as GDP and poverty reduction, especially in states like Bihar. The spirit of Onam, a celebration of prosperity, should inspire effective policy design. There is a need for better monitoring and transparency in implementation, for instance, direct benefit transfer (DBT) for LPG, to minimise leakages and corruption. Periodic reviews are essential, say every 5 years, for course correction.
