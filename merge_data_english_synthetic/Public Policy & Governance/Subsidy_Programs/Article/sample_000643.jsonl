{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deployed across a wide range of sectors. Agriculture, for instance, receives significant subsidies in the form of subsidized fertilizers, irrigation, and electricity. The intention is to enhance agricultural productivity, ensure food security for a nation with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, and support the livelihoods of millions of farmers, especially those with small landholdings. However, these subsidies have been criticized for contributing to inefficient resource allocation, water depletion, and environmental degradation, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana.", "normalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deployed across a wide range of sectors.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges in the design and implementation of subsidy programs in India are multifaceted. Leakages, corruption, and inefficient targeting often undermine their intended benefits. For instance, the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains to the poor, has been plagued by issues of diversion and inclusion errors. Efforts are underway to improve targeting through initiatives like Aadhaar-linked identification and direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes, which aim to transfer subsidies directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, minimizing intermediaries and reducing corruption.", "normalised": "Challenges in the design and implementation of subsidy programs in India are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of subsidies is a subject of ongoing debate. While proponents argue that subsidies are essential for promoting inclusive growth and addressing market failures, critics contend that they distort markets, create inefficiencies, and impose a heavy burden on the government exchequer. For example, electricity subsidies to farmers, while intended to support agriculture, can lead to unsustainable groundwater extraction and a strain on state finances, often resulting in delayed payments to power generating companies.", "normalised": "The economic impact of subsidies is a subject of ongoing debate.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the long-term sustainability of subsidy programs is a major concern. The fiscal deficit, which represents the difference between government revenue and expenditure, is significantly influenced by the size of subsidy bills. Balancing the need to provide essential support to vulnerable populations with the imperative of maintaining fiscal discipline is a complex policy challenge. Reforming subsidy programs to make them more efficient, targeted, and sustainable is a key priority for policymakers in India. This includes exploring options such as phasing out inefficient subsidies, promoting market-based pricing, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. It’s a complex balancing act that impacts everything from the price of biryani at a street stall to the success of major infrastructure projects covering hundreds of km. The annual budget allocation of, say, Rs. 3,00,000 crore for various subsidies requires rigorous justification and scrutiny.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the long-term sustainability of subsidy programs is a major concern.
