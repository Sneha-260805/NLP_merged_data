{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs represent a cornerstone of India's public policy framework, aimed at achieving diverse socio-economic objectives. These interventions, characterized by financial assistance provided by the government, are designed to influence market prices, incentivize specific behaviors, and redistribute resources, particularly to vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs represent a cornerstone of India's public policy framework, aimed at achieving diverse socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "Across sectors ranging from agriculture to energy and education, India employs a wide array of subsidy schemes. The fertilizer subsidy, for example, intends to ensure affordable access to essential inputs for farmers, boosting agricultural productivity and contributing to food security. Similarly, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides subsidized wage employment, creating a safety net for rural households and fostering rural infrastructure development. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aims to provide affordable housing to the urban and rural poor through interest subsidies and direct financial assistance.", "normalised": "Across sectors ranging from agriculture to energy and education, India employs a wide array of subsidy schemes.

{"unnormalised": "However, the implementation and impact of subsidy programs are often fraught with challenges. Leakage, inefficiencies, and unintended consequences are persistent concerns. The Public Distribution System (PDS), while intended to ensure access to subsidized food grains, has been plagued by issues of corruption and diversion of resources. The petroleum subsidy, designed to cushion consumers from volatile global oil prices, has faced criticism for its fiscal burden and potential distortions in energy consumption patterns. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) highlighted the significant fiscal implications of various subsidy programs in India, amounting to several percentage points of GDP.", "normalised": "However, the implementation and impact of subsidy programs are often fraught with challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the design of subsidy programs needs careful consideration to avoid creating dependency or distorting market signals. For instance, overly generous input subsidies in agriculture can lead to inefficient use of resources, such as excessive water consumption. The rationalization of subsidy schemes is therefore crucial for enhancing their effectiveness and ensuring fiscal sustainability.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the design of subsidy programs needs careful consideration to avoid creating dependency or distorting market signals.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs is often framed by competing perspectives on equity versus efficiency. While subsidies can play a vital role in addressing poverty and inequality, it's imperative that they are well-targeted, transparent, and periodically reviewed to minimize unintended negative impacts. The success of any subsidy program ultimately hinges on its design, implementation, and monitoring mechanisms. Remember the famous dialogue from the Bollywood film \"Rang De Basanti\" - “Koi bhi desh perfect nahin hota, use perfect banana padta hai.” The same principle applies to subsidy schemes; continuous improvement is necessary to maximize their benefits for the people of India.", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs is often framed by competing perspectives on equity versus efficiency.
