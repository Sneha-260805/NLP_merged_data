{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial component of India's public policy framework, aimed at achieving diverse socio-economic objectives ranging from poverty alleviation and food security to industrial development and environmental protection. These interventions, which typically involve financial assistance or price support, seek to correct market failures, promote equitable access to essential goods and services, and stimulate economic growth in targeted sectors.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial component of India's public policy framework, aimed at achieving diverse socio-economic objectives ranging from poverty alleviation and food security to industrial development or environmental protection.

{"unnormalised": "In the Indian context, the history of subsidy programs is deeply intertwined with the nation's development trajectory. Following independence, the emphasis on a socialist pattern of development led to the introduction of extensive subsidies across sectors like agriculture, energy, and fertilizer. The Public Distribution System (PDS), a significant subsidy program, ensures the availability of food grains at subsidized prices to millions of Indians, bolstering food security, especially in rural areas. The impact on festivals such as Onam, where rice plays a central role, is undeniable as families can afford to celebrate with traditional meals.", "normalised": "In the Indian context, the history of subsidy programs is deeply intertwined with the nation's development trajectory.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. Concerns regarding fiscal sustainability, leakages, and inefficiencies have consistently plagued these interventions. The large fiscal burden of subsidies, particularly fuel subsidies which can fluctuate with global oil prices, often restricts the government's ability to invest in crucial areas like infrastructure and healthcare. Furthermore, the potential for rent-seeking and corruption undermines the effectiveness of these programs. A study by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) estimated leakages in fertilizer subsidies to be as high as 30% in some regions.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Recent policy initiatives have focused on improving the targeting and delivery mechanisms of subsidy programs. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, which directly transfers subsidies to beneficiaries' bank accounts, has emerged as a key strategy for reducing leakages and ensuring transparency. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), for instance, provides Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers through DBT. The success of DBT in reducing leakages for LPG subsidies, as reported by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, highlights the potential of this approach.", "normalised": "Recent policy initiatives have focused on improving the targeting and delivery mechanisms of subsidy programs.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on continuous reforms and rigorous evaluation. Moving towards targeted subsidies, promoting greater transparency and accountability, and investing in technological solutions are crucial for maximizing the benefits of these interventions. Furthermore, fostering a culture of evidence-based policymaking, where programs are regularly assessed for their impact and efficiency, is essential for ensuring that subsidy programs effectively contribute to India's development goals. While the lure of biryani might be a tempting vote-getter, long-term sustainable solutions are needed. Successfully navigating these challenges will be critical for harnessing the power of subsidy programs to build a more prosperous and equitable India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on continuous reforms and rigorous evaluation.
