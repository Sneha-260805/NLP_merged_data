{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs form a cornerstone of public policy in India, serving as instruments to achieve various socio-economic objectives. These interventions involve the government providing financial assistance, either directly or indirectly, to specific sectors, industries, or individuals, aiming to influence market outcomes and address societal needs. In the Indian context, subsidies are particularly crucial in addressing issues related to poverty alleviation, food security, agricultural productivity, and promoting industrial growth.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs form a cornerstone of public policy in India, serving as instruments to achieve various socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "A key area where subsidies play a significant role is agriculture. The provision of subsidized fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and minimum support prices (MSP) for crops are designed to incentivise farmers, increase production, and ensure food security for the nation's vast population. For example, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmer families, distributed in three installments of Rs. 2,000 each, acting as a direct income support subsidy. However, these agricultural subsidies are often criticized for their potential to distort market prices, encourage overuse of resources like water, and benefit larger landowners disproportionately.", "normalised": "A key area where subsidies play a significant role is agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area is food security. The Public Distribution System (PDS), providing subsidized food grains to eligible households, aims to ensure access to affordable food, especially for the economically vulnerable sections of society. This ensures that even those struggling to afford basic necessities can enjoy a wholesome meal – perhaps even a celebratory biryani during festive occasions. The National Food Security Act, 2013, further strengthens this system by legally entitling a large proportion of the population to receive subsidized food grains.", "normalised": "Another significant area is food security.

{"unnormalised": "Industrial subsidies are also prevalent, designed to promote specific industries or regions. These may take the form of tax breaks, concessional loans, or direct financial assistance. For instance, schemes promoting manufacturing, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, aim to attract investment, boost domestic production, and create employment opportunities, particularly in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals. Such subsidies often target locations considered backward regions like certain districts in Bihar or the North-East, incentivizing industrial development in these areas.", "normalised": "Industrial subsidies are also prevalent, designed to promote specific industries or regions.

{"unnormalised": "However, the effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate. Concerns are often raised regarding their fiscal burden on the government exchequer, potential for corruption, and unintended consequences. Moreover, the rationalisation and targeting of subsidies are crucial for ensuring that they reach the intended beneficiaries and achieve their objectives efficiently. Leakages, inefficiencies, and the potential for creating dependencies are significant challenges that need to be addressed through robust monitoring, evaluation, and reform measures. Reforms in subsidy delivery mechanisms, such as the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, aim to improve targeting and reduce leakages by directly transferring subsidies to beneficiaries' bank accounts. This is particularly evident in schemes like PAHAL, which provides LPG subsidies directly to consumers.", "normalised": "However, the effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the impact of subsidy programs on environmental sustainability is a growing concern. For example, subsidized electricity for irrigation can lead to over-extraction of groundwater resources, posing a long-term threat to water security. Balancing the socio-economic benefits of subsidies with their environmental costs is therefore a critical policy challenge. The debate on the future of subsidy programs in India requires a holistic approach, considering their impact on economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability. It necessitates continuous evaluation and adaptation to ensure that these programs effectively serve their intended purpose in a rapidly evolving socio-economic landscape. It’s especially pertinent around key harvest festivals like Onam when the impact on the agrarian economy is felt most acutely.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the impact of subsidy programs on environmental sustainability is a growing concern.
