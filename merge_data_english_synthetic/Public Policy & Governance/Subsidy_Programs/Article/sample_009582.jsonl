{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, designed to achieve specific socio-economic goals. These programs, which involve the government providing financial assistance to individuals, businesses, or other entities, aim to correct market failures, promote equity, and stimulate economic growth.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains to millions of households across the country. This program, dating back to pre-independence India, ensures that vulnerable populations have access to essential food items at affordable prices. The PDS operates through a network of fair price shops, offering wheat, rice, and sugar at subsidized rates. Challenges remain, however, regarding leakages, inefficiency, and targeting errors, necessitating continuous reforms.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the Public Distribution System (P D S), which provides subsidized food grains to millions of households across the country.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area where subsidies play a vital role is in agriculture. The Indian government provides subsidies on fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and agricultural credit to support farmers and boost agricultural production. These subsidies aim to reduce the input costs for farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders, and encourage them to adopt modern agricultural practices. However, the sustainability of these subsidies, particularly power subsidies, is a subject of ongoing debate due to their impact on the environment and state finances. Think of the debates surrounding free electricity for farmers in Punjab, for instance, and the strain it places on the state's discoms.", "normalised": "Another significant area where subsidies play a vital role is in agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the government offers subsidies in sectors like education and healthcare to improve access to these essential services for all citizens. Schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the National Health Mission utilize subsidy mechanisms to promote enrollment in schools and provide affordable healthcare services, respectively. The launch of Ayushman Bharat on 23/09/2018 was a landmark in this regard, aiming to provide health insurance coverage to a significant portion of the population.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the government offers subsidies in sectors like education and healthcare to improve access to these essential services for all citizens.

{"unnormalised": "The rationale behind subsidies is often rooted in the concept of social justice and ensuring a level playing field for all. However, the design and implementation of subsidy programs must be carefully considered to maximize their effectiveness and minimize unintended consequences. Leakage, corruption, and inefficient targeting can erode the benefits of subsidies and impose a significant burden on the exchequer.", "normalised": "The rationale behind subsidies is often rooted in the concept of social justice and ensuring a level playing field for all.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidies is complex. While proponents argue that they are essential for social welfare and economic development, critics point to their fiscal burden, market distortions, and potential for misuse. The government must strike a balance between providing necessary support and ensuring fiscal prudence. Continuous evaluation and reform of subsidy programs are necessary to ensure they achieve their intended objectives in an efficient and sustainable manner. For instance, a review of the fertilizer subsidy scheme is often conducted around the time of the Union Budget presentation, typically around 11:00 hrs on the date of presentation.", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidies is complex.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of subsidy programs in India will likely be shaped by technological advancements and evolving policy priorities. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), for example, is increasingly being used to deliver subsidies directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, reducing leakages and improving transparency.

Awareness campaigns like those run on Doordarshan at 19:00 hrs every evening are important for ensuring people are informed about their rights and how to avail of government schemes. Ultimately, well-designed and effectively implemented subsidy programs can play a critical role in India's pursuit of inclusive growth and sustainable development, contributing to the vision of a \"New India\" by 2047.", "normalised": "The efficacy of these programs also depends on the level of awareness among the target population.
