{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program. Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana benefit from subsidized fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation water, designed to boost food production and ensure food security for a nation of 1.4 billion people. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, announced before each sowing season, acts as a subsidy, guaranteeing farmers a certain price for their produce regardless of market fluctuations. While proponents argue that these subsidies are vital for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and preventing rural distress, critics point to inefficiencies, environmental degradation (e.g., excessive groundwater depletion), and market distortions caused by these interventions. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, launched on 01/12/2018, provides direct income support of Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, further highlighting the government's commitment to the agricultural sector.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, India also employs subsidies in other key areas. For instance, education receives significant support through scholarships, subsidized tuition fees, and grants to institutions like the IITs and IIMs. The aim is to improve access to quality education, particularly for disadvantaged sections of society. Similarly, healthcare subsidies are prevalent, with schemes like Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) providing health insurance coverage to millions of families. These initiatives aim to reduce the financial burden of healthcare and improve health outcomes.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, India also employs subsidies in other key areas.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of continuous debate. While they can alleviate poverty, stimulate economic growth, and address market failures, they also pose several challenges. These include fiscal burden on the government exchequer, potential for corruption and leakages, unintended consequences, and difficulty in targeting beneficiaries effectively. Imagine, for instance, the complexities involved in ensuring that kerosene subsidies reach the intended poor households in remote villages of Rajasthan.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of continuous debate.

{"unnormalised": "Effective design and implementation are crucial for maximizing the benefits of subsidy programs. This includes robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, transparent targeting criteria, and efforts to minimize leakages and corruption. Consider the LPG subsidy scheme (PAHAL), which was revamped in 2015 to directly transfer subsidies to consumers' bank accounts, thereby curbing diversion and improving efficiency. The implementation of such DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes has generally seen improvements in the efficiency of subsidy delivery across various sectors.", "normalised": "Effective design and implementation are crucial for maximizing the benefits of subsidy programs.

{"unnormalised": "The timing of implementation is also vital. For example, crop insurance subsidies are often most effective when disbursed promptly before the monsoon season, say by 15/06, allowing farmers to make informed planting decisions. Furthermore, a periodic review of existing subsidy programs is essential to assess their relevance, impact, and cost-effectiveness. Sunset clauses, specifying an expiry date for a subsidy program, can also ensure that these programs are not perpetuated indefinitely without proper evaluation. A meeting to discuss subsidy reforms might be scheduled for 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2024 at NITI Aayog, New Delhi. Subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), for example, might be reviewed to align with evolving market conditions and technological advancements.", "normalised": "The timing of implementation is also vital.
