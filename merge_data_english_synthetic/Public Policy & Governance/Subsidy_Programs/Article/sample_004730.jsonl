{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, aimed at achieving specific socio-economic objectives. Essentially, a subsidy is a financial assistance provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or other institutions to reduce the cost of a good or service. These interventions are designed to make essential goods and services more affordable and accessible, promoting welfare and stimulating economic activity.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, aimed at achieving specific socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidies are prevalent across various sectors. Consider, for example, the Public Distribution System (PDS), a massive food subsidy program that provides subsidized food grains to millions of vulnerable households. This is critical for food security, especially in rural areas of states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The government procures grains, often through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), and distributes them at heavily subsidized rates through a network of fair price shops. The success of PDS is, however, often debated, with issues of leakage and inefficiencies persisting.", "normalised": "In India, subsidies are prevalent across various sectors.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area is agricultural subsidies. Farmers receive subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation, intended to boost agricultural production and ensure food self-sufficiency. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism also functions as an indirect subsidy, guaranteeing farmers a certain price for their produce. This is particularly important for farmers struggling with unpredictable weather patterns and market fluctuations. Discussions around agricultural subsidies are almost always heated, especially during parliamentary sessions, like the one convened on 26/01/2024 to debate the implementation of new farm laws.", "normalised": "Another significant area is agricultural subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel subsidies, particularly on LPG for household use, aim to make cooking gas more affordable for low-income families. However, these subsidies can be fiscally burdensome and environmentally detrimental, prompting the government to explore alternative strategies like direct benefit transfers (DBT) to target the right beneficiaries. The launch of the 'Ujjwala Yojana' at 11:00 hrs on 01/05/2016, which provides subsidized LPG connections to women from BPL households, exemplifies this approach.", "normalised": "Fuel subsidies, particularly on L P G for household use, aim to make cooking gas more affordable for low-income families.

{"unnormalised": "Education is another sector benefiting from subsidies. Scholarships, fee waivers, and subsidized loans make education accessible to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, fostering social mobility and human capital development. The 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' and the 'Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan' are prominent examples of initiatives that leverage subsidies to improve access to quality education at different levels.", "normalised": "Education is another sector benefiting from subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidies are not without their drawbacks. They can distort markets, create inefficiencies, and put a strain on the government's finances. The fiscal deficit is often impacted by the scale of these programs. Moreover, poorly designed or implemented subsidies can lead to corruption and benefit the unintended recipients. Careful monitoring and evaluation, along with reforms aimed at targeting beneficiaries more effectively and reducing leakages, are crucial. The government's commitment to phasing out inefficient subsidies by 31/12/2025, as announced in the recent budget, signals an attempt to address these challenges. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate, often fueled by economists like Dr. Amartya Sen, about the optimal level of subsidy intervention and the need for a more nuanced approach that considers both economic efficiency and social justice.", "normalised": "However, subsidies are not without their drawbacks.
