{"unnormalised": "Agricultural subsidies are particularly prominent, designed to support farmers facing unpredictable weather patterns and market fluctuations. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, for instance, guarantees a fixed price for certain crops, protecting farmers from drastic price drops. Fertilizer subsidies, though crucial for boosting agricultural production, have also been criticized for promoting overuse and environmental degradation. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides direct income support of Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers, offering a safety net against financial hardship.", "normalised": "Agricultural subsidies are particularly prominent, designed to support farmers facing unpredictable weather patterns and market fluctuations.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel subsidies, historically significant in India, aimed to provide affordable energy access to the masses. However, their high fiscal burden and distortionary effects led to gradual reforms, including the introduction of direct benefit transfer (DBT) for LPG cylinders under the PAHAL scheme. This approach aims to target subsidies more effectively, reducing leakage and ensuring that benefits reach the intended recipients.", "normalised": "Fuel subsidies, historically significant in India, aimed to provide affordable energy access to the masses.

{"unnormalised": "Food subsidies, primarily channeled through the Public Distribution System (PDS), are vital for ensuring food security, particularly for vulnerable populations. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 entitles a significant portion of the population to subsidized food grains. While the PDS has been instrumental in addressing hunger, challenges remain in terms of efficiency and targeting. Imagine the plight of a daily wage laborer in Delhi, reliant on the PDS for a daily meal, struggling to make ends meet.", "normalised": "Food subsidies, primarily channeled through the Public Distribution System (P D S), are vital for ensuring food security, particularly for vulnerable populations.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is often debated. While they can be instrumental in achieving social goals, they can also lead to inefficiencies, market distortions, and fiscal strain. The case of electricity subsidies for agriculture in Punjab highlights this dilemma, as it has contributed to groundwater depletion. Periodic reviews and evaluations are essential to ensure that subsidy programs are well-targeted, cost-effective, and aligned with national priorities. The implementation of technology and robust monitoring mechanisms can help to minimize leakages and enhance the overall efficiency of these critical policy interventions. Onam Sadya, the traditional Kerala feast, embodies the concept of equitable distribution and access, ideals that subsidy programs strive to achieve in a broader societal context. The challenge lies in ensuring these programs deliver on their promise without creating unintended consequences.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is often debated.
