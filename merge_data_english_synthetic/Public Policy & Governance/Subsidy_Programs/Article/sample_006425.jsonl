{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs represent a crucial instrument in India's public policy arsenal, designed to address market failures, promote socio-economic development, and achieve specific policy objectives. These interventions, typically involving direct financial assistance, tax breaks, or in-kind support, are deployed across diverse sectors, ranging from agriculture to energy, and have profound implications for the nation's economy and governance.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs represent a crucial instrument in India's public policy arsenal, designed to address market failures, promote socio-economic development, and achieve specific policy objectives.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program, aimed at bolstering farmer incomes and ensuring food security. These subsidies, often provided in the form of subsidized fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation, have been instrumental in driving the Green Revolution and transforming India into a food surplus nation. However, they have also been criticized for their distortionary effects on the market, contributing to over-production of certain crops, such as rice and wheat, and environmental degradation. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism, another form of agricultural subsidy, guarantees a fixed price to farmers for their produce, providing a safety net during times of price volatility.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program, aimed at bolstering farmer incomes and ensuring food security.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, India implements substantial subsidies in the energy sector, particularly for LPG and kerosene, to ensure access to affordable fuel for vulnerable households. While these subsidies aim to alleviate poverty and improve living standards, they often lead to leakages, inefficiencies, and environmental concerns. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme providing subsidized LPG connections to women from BPL households, represents an attempt to address these challenges by targeting subsidies more effectively.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, India implements substantial subsidies in the energy sector, particularly for L P G and kerosene, to ensure access to affordable fuel for vulnerable households.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, educational institutions, particularly those catering to marginalized communities, often benefit from subsidy programs. This includes reduced tuition fees, scholarships, and grants aimed at promoting educational attainment and social mobility. The Right to Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years, effectively creating a significant subsidy for primary education.", "normalised": "Furthermore, educational institutions, particularly those catering to marginalized communities, often benefit from subsidy programs.

{"unnormalised": "However, the extensive use of subsidies in India necessitates careful evaluation and reform. The fiscal burden of these programs is substantial, often exceeding Rs. 3,00,000 crore annually. Critics argue that poorly designed subsidies can lead to inefficiencies, rent-seeking behaviour, and unintended consequences. The debate around subsidy reform often revolves around issues of targeting, transparency, and accountability. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, which directly transfer subsidies to beneficiaries' bank accounts, have been lauded as a means to reduce leakages and improve efficiency. For instance, the PAHAL scheme for LPG subsidies has reportedly saved the government thousands of crores of rupees.", "normalised": "However, the extensive use of subsidies in India necessitates careful evaluation and reform.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is also influenced by the prevailing political and social context. During festivals like Onam in Kerala, state governments often provide additional subsidies or distribute food kits to support low-income families. These interventions, while popular, need to be carefully assessed for their long-term impact and sustainability. The enjoyment of a plate of delicious biryani during a festive occasion should not be at the cost of unsustainable subsidy policies.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is also influenced by the prevailing political and social context.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to subsidy design and implementation. This involves rigorous impact evaluations, improved targeting mechanisms, and greater transparency to ensure that these crucial public policy instruments effectively contribute to the nation's socio-economic development. The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) plays a vital role in advising the government on subsidy reforms and promoting more efficient and equitable allocation of resources. Reaching the goal of inclusive growth requires careful recalibration of subsidy programs, focusing on long-term sustainability and minimizing unintended consequences.", "normalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to subsidy design and implementation.
