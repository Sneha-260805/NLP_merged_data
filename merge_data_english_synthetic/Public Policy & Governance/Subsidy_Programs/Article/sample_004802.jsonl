{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples lies in the agricultural sector. Subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, and electricity are prevalent, aiming to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure food security for the nation's burgeoning population. These programs, while intended to support farmers like those in Punjab and Haryana, have also been subject to criticism regarding their environmental impact and potential for inefficient resource allocation. Concerns are often raised that blanket subsidies, without targeted approaches, can lead to overuse of resources, such as excessive irrigation, contributing to groundwater depletion.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples lies in the agricultural sector.

{"unnormalised": "The petroleum sector also benefits significantly from subsidies. Historically, the government heavily subsidized LPG cylinders and petrol, aiming to provide affordable energy to households. However, these policies have faced reform, with the implementation of direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes like PAHAL, where subsidies are directly credited to beneficiaries' bank accounts. This move seeks to reduce leakages and improve targeting, addressing concerns about the inefficient distribution of subsidized kerosene that disproportionately benefitted wealthier households.", "normalised": "The petroleum sector also benefits significantly from subsidies.

Government-funded schools and universities, like Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), offer subsidized education to students. The aim is to promote access to education, especially for marginalized communities and those from economically weaker sections.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, subsidy programs in India are a complex and multifaceted instrument of public policy. Their design, implementation, and evaluation require careful consideration to ensure that they effectively achieve their intended objectives without creating undue economic distortions or fiscal burdens. Continued reforms and improved targeting are necessary to optimize their contribution to India's inclusive growth and sustainable development. The allocated amount can be Rs. 2 lakh crore per year.", "normalised": "Ultimately, subsidy programs in India are a complex and multifaceted instrument of public policy.
