{"unnormalised": "One prominent example is the subsidy provided to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. This direct benefit transfer program provides eligible farmers with an annual income support of Rs. 6,000, disbursed in three equal installments. The goal is to alleviate financial distress among small and marginal farmers, enabling them to invest in agricultural inputs and improve their livelihoods. The effectiveness of PM-KISAN has been debated, with studies from institutions like the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) providing varying perspectives on its impact on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction.", "normalised": "One prominent example is the subsidy provided to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (P M K I S A N) scheme.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies are also utilized to promote renewable energy adoption. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), for instance, offered subsidies to encourage solar power generation, contributing to India's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security. These subsidies often take the form of feed-in tariffs or capital cost subsidies, making renewable energy projects more financially viable.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies are also utilized to promote renewable energy adoption.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. Concerns about fiscal sustainability, leakage, and targeting accuracy are frequently raised. Leakage refers to instances where subsidies are diverted to unintended beneficiaries or misused, diminishing their intended impact. Effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are essential to address these challenges and ensure that subsidies are reaching the intended recipients and achieving their stated objectives. The Public Distribution System (PDS), providing subsidized food grains to vulnerable populations, has historically faced issues of leakage, prompting reforms aimed at greater transparency and efficiency.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The political economy of subsidies is also a complex issue. As portrayed in Bollywood films like \"Peepli Live,\" issues like agrarian distress and farmer suicides highlight the urgency of government interventions. However, subsidy reforms often face resistance from vested interests, making it difficult to rationalize or phase out inefficient or poorly targeted programs. Therefore, effective communication strategies and stakeholder engagement are crucial for building consensus and ensuring the long-term sustainability of subsidy programs. Robust impact assessments are also needed to demonstrate the value for money and justify continued investment in specific subsidy schemes.", "normalised": "The political economy of subsidies is also a complex issue.
