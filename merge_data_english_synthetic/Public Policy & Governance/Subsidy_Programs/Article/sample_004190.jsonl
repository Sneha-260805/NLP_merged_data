{"unnormalised": "These programs, ranging from direct cash transfers to subsidized inputs, are designed to target specific sectors and populations. A prominent example is the Minimum Support Price (MSP) offered to farmers for crops like rice and wheat, ensuring a guaranteed income and encouraging agricultural production. This intervention aims to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating market prices and contribute to food security. The Public Distribution System (PDS), another key subsidy program, provides subsidized food grains, such as rice and wheat, to vulnerable sections of society through a network of Fair Price Shops (FPS). This ensures that even those living below the poverty line can access essential food items at affordable rates, combating hunger and malnutrition.", "normalised": "These programs, ranging from direct cash transfers to subsidized inputs, are designed to target specific sectors and populations.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their complexities and challenges. The economic burden of subsidies can be substantial, impacting government budgets and potentially crowding out other essential public investments. Leakages and inefficiencies in the delivery mechanisms are also a persistent concern. For instance, the misidentification of beneficiaries or diversion of subsidized goods can undermine the intended impact of the program. Moreover, subsidies can distort market dynamics, leading to unintended consequences, such as overproduction of subsidized crops and unsustainable agricultural practices.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their complexities and challenges.

{"unnormalised": "In the realm of energy, subsidies on LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) have been used to encourage cleaner cooking fuels, reducing reliance on traditional biomass and improving indoor air quality, particularly in rural households. Similarly, fertilizer subsidies aim to make agricultural inputs more affordable for farmers, boosting crop yields. However, the indiscriminate use of fertilizers, often driven by subsidized prices, can lead to soil degradation and environmental pollution, requiring careful policy recalibration.", "normalised": "In the realm of energy, subsidies on L P G (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) have been used to encourage cleaner cooking fuels, reducing reliance on traditional biomass and improving indoor air quality, particularly in rural households.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of these programs often involves intricate bureaucratic processes, requiring coordination between central and state governments. The effectiveness of a subsidy program often depends on rigorous monitoring and evaluation, as well as adaptive policy adjustments based on feedback and data analysis. For example, the introduction of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes has aimed to reduce leakages and improve the efficiency of subsidy delivery by directly transferring funds to beneficiaries' bank accounts. This cuts out intermediaries and ensures that the intended recipients receive the benefits directly.", "normalised": "The implementation of these programs often involves intricate bureaucratic processes, requiring coordination between central and state governments.

{"unnormalised": "As India progresses towards a more developed economy, the design and implementation of subsidy programs must evolve to address emerging challenges and optimize their impact. A key focus must be on targeting subsidies more effectively, reducing leakages, and promoting sustainable practices. A well-designed subsidy program should not just provide immediate relief but also contribute to long-term economic growth and social development. It's about ensuring that the benefits reach those who truly need it, like a warm plate of biryani shared during Eid celebrations, ensuring everyone has enough to eat. Programs like PM-KISAN offering Rs. 6,000 per year directly to farmers also seek to reduce rural distress. This requires continuous evaluation and reform, considering factors like inflation (e.g., a 5% hike in food prices), population growth (e.g., a 2% annual increase), and geographical disparities (e.g., poorer districts lacking 100 km road access).", "normalised": "As India progresses towards a more developed economy, the design and implementation of subsidy programs must evolve to address emerging challenges and optimize their impact.
