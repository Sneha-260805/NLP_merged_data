{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs constitute a significant component of public policy and governance in India, designed to achieve a multitude of socio-economic objectives. These programs, ranging from agricultural input subsidies to energy and infrastructure development incentives, aim to alleviate poverty, promote inclusive growth, and address market failures.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural subsidies, for instance, are a cornerstone of India's food security policy. Programs like subsidized fertilizers and irrigation are intended to boost agricultural productivity and ensure food availability for a large and vulnerable population. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, providing Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, directly addresses income support. However, the effectiveness of these subsidies is often debated, with concerns about their impact on soil health, water depletion, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Studies by institutions like the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) have highlighted the need for reforms to ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries and promote sustainable agricultural practices.", "normalised": "Agricultural subsidies, for instance, are a cornerstone of India's food security policy.

{"unnormalised": "Energy subsidies, particularly in the form of subsidized electricity and LPG cylinders, aim to provide affordable access to essential services for households and industries. The Ujjwala Yojana, for instance, provides subsidized LPG connections to women from Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. However, these subsidies can contribute to environmental degradation and create distortions in the energy market. Furthermore, leakages and inefficiencies in distribution channels often undermine the intended impact.", "normalised": "Energy subsidies, particularly in the form of subsidized electricity and L P G cylinders, aim to provide affordable access to essential services for households and industries.

{"unnormalised": "Industrial subsidies, such as tax breaks and concessional land allotments, are implemented to attract investment, promote manufacturing, and generate employment. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme aim to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities and integrate Indian industries into global value chains. The success of these subsidies hinges on careful design, effective monitoring, and a supportive regulatory environment.", "normalised": "Industrial subsidies, such as tax breaks and concessional land allotments, are implemented to attract investment, promote manufacturing, and generate employment.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of subsidy programs often faces challenges related to targeting, leakages, and monitoring. The Public Distribution System (PDS), designed to provide subsidized food grains to the poor, has been subject to criticism regarding inefficiencies and diversion of resources. The movie 'Peepli Live' poignantly illustrated the struggles of farmers and the systemic issues plaguing rural India, including access to subsidies and government assistance.", "normalised": "The implementation of subsidy programs often faces challenges related to targeting, leakages, and monitoring.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, a comprehensive reform agenda is needed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of subsidy programs in India. This includes strengthening targeting mechanisms, leveraging technology to improve monitoring and reduce leakages, and promoting evidence-based policy making. Furthermore, a shift towards direct benefit transfers (DBT) can help to reduce corruption and ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries directly. A well-designed and effectively implemented subsidy regime can play a crucial role in achieving India's development goals and ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth.", "normalised": "Moving forward, a comprehensive reform agenda is needed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of subsidy programs in India.
