{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidies are pervasive across various sectors. Agriculture, for instance, relies heavily on input subsidies related to fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation. The objective is to make farming viable, ensure food security for a population of 1.4 billion, and support the livelihoods of millions of farmers, many of whom are small and marginal landowners facing significant economic vulnerability. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism, though not strictly a subsidy, operates on similar principles by guaranteeing a pre-determined price for certain agricultural commodities, thereby reducing price risk for farmers.", "normalised": "In India, subsidies are pervasive across various sectors.

{"unnormalised": "Social welfare also benefits significantly from subsidy programs. The Public Distribution System (PDS) provides subsidized food grains, like rice and wheat, to vulnerable sections of the population, ensuring access to basic nutrition. Fuel subsidies, particularly on LPG cylinders, aim to make essential cooking fuel affordable, especially for women in rural households. Education and healthcare also receive substantial subsidies, striving to improve access and quality, ultimately leading to enhanced human capital.", "normalised": "Social welfare also benefits significantly from subsidy programs.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs in India are not without their challenges. Leakages, inefficient targeting, and the potential for market distortions are significant concerns. For example, fertilizer subsidies, while intended to benefit farmers, can lead to overuse, harming soil health and impacting environmental sustainability. The implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes aims to address these leakages by directly transferring subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts, improving efficiency and transparency.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs in India are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The fiscal burden of subsidies is substantial, consuming a significant portion of the government's budget. Rationalizing subsidies, ensuring effective targeting, and promoting sustainable practices are crucial for responsible fiscal management and maximizing the positive impact of these programs. Consider the case of Kerala, where during Onam celebrations, the government often offers subsidized food kits to ensure that every family can afford to prepare a grand Onam Sadhya. Such targeted interventions during festivals reflect the government's commitment to social welfare, although the long-term financial implications require careful consideration.", "normalised": "The fiscal burden of subsidies is substantial, consuming a significant portion of the government's budget.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness of subsidies in achieving desired outcomes is debated. For example, while subsidies on electricity may improve agricultural output in the short term, they can also discourage water conservation and lead to unsustainable agricultural practices. A holistic approach, incorporating complementary policies that promote sustainable development and build long-term capacity, is essential for realizing the full potential of subsidy programs. Rs. 5000 crore was allocated for a new subsidy scheme last year. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers. A distance of 100 km was covered by the subsidy scheme.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness of subsidies in achieving desired outcomes is debated.
