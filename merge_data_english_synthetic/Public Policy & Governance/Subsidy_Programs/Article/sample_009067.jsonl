{"unnormalised": "Subsidies constitute a significant instrument within the Indian public policy framework, employed by the government to achieve diverse socio-economic objectives. Ranging from agricultural inputs to energy consumption, and even promoting specific industries, these programs aim to alleviate market failures, redistribute wealth, and stimulate economic growth. However, the efficacy and long-term sustainability of subsidy programs remain a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers and economists.", "normalised": "Subsidies constitute a significant instrument within the Indian public policy framework, employed by the government to achieve diverse socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent areas of subsidy intervention in India is agriculture. Fertilizer subsidies, aimed at ensuring affordability for farmers, have been a long-standing feature. While they contribute to increased agricultural output in the short term, concerns about environmental degradation due to overuse and the budgetary burden on the government are persistent. Similarly, power subsidies for agricultural use, particularly in states like Punjab and Haryana, are intended to support farmers but often lead to inefficient water usage and strain on the power grid. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, like PM-KISAN, represent an attempt to reform these subsidy regimes by directly transferring cash to farmers' accounts, circumventing inefficiencies and leakages.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent areas of subsidy intervention in India is agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, India employs subsidies in various other sectors. Petroleum subsidies, designed to cushion consumers from volatile global oil prices, have historically been a major expenditure. The gradual deregulation of fuel prices aimed to reduce this burden, although the government continues to intervene at times, particularly during periods of high inflation. Subsidized LPG cylinders, particularly under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, seek to promote cleaner cooking fuels in rural households, thereby improving public health and reducing deforestation.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, India employs subsidies in various other sectors.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, specific industries receive subsidies to encourage growth and innovation. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme provides financial incentives to companies that manufacture certain goods domestically, aiming to boost manufacturing capacity and reduce reliance on imports. This aligns with the \"Make in India\" initiative.", "normalised": "Moreover, specific industries receive subsidies to encourage growth and innovation.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of subsidy programs is often intertwined with political considerations. For instance, during the Onam festival in Kerala, the state government provides subsidized food grains and other essential items through ration shops, reflecting a cultural significance and aiming to ensure food security during the festive season.

{"unnormalised": "The financial implications of subsidies are substantial. The total expenditure on subsidies in India often amounts to several lakh crores of Rupees annually, placing a significant strain on the fiscal deficit. Balancing the social and economic benefits of subsidies with the need for fiscal prudence requires careful policy design and rigorous evaluation. A shift towards more targeted and transparent subsidy mechanisms, coupled with improved monitoring and evaluation frameworks, is crucial for ensuring that these programs effectively contribute to India's development goals. Reforms are ongoing, with initiatives focusing on rationalization, leakage reduction, and transitioning to more sustainable models of support.", "normalised": "The financial implications of subsidies are substantial.
