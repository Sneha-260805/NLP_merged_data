{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, playing a crucial role in achieving socio-economic objectives. Essentially, a subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended by the government to individuals, businesses, or other entities. These interventions aim to lower costs, increase production, or stimulate consumption in specific sectors deemed vital for the nation's progress.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, playing a crucial role in achieving socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidies are prevalent across various sectors, from agriculture to energy and education. The rationale behind these programs is multifaceted. For instance, agricultural subsidies, such as those provided for fertilizers and electricity, are intended to ensure food security and support the livelihoods of farmers, particularly small and marginal landowners in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. These subsidies aim to make farming viable despite fluctuating market prices and adverse weather conditions. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism, where the government commits to purchasing crops at a predetermined price, also acts as a subsidy, insulating farmers from market volatility.", "normalised": "In India, subsidies are prevalent across various sectors, from agriculture to energy and education.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. One major concern is the fiscal burden they place on the government. The sheer scale of subsidies, especially in sectors like food and petroleum, can strain the national budget, potentially diverting resources from other essential areas like healthcare and infrastructure development. The Food Corporation of India (FCI), for example, plays a central role in procuring and distributing subsidized food grains under the National Food Security Act, requiring substantial government expenditure.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another criticism revolves around the potential for inefficiency and leakage. Subsidies can sometimes be poorly targeted, benefiting unintended recipients or being siphoned off through corruption. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, launched in 2013, aims to address this issue by directly transferring subsidy amounts into the bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries, reducing the scope for intermediaries and improving transparency. For instance, LPG subsidies are now largely disbursed through DBT, aiming to eliminate ghost beneficiaries and ensure that the intended recipients receive the assistance.", "normalised": "Another criticism revolves around the potential for inefficiency and leakage.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, subsidies can distort market signals and create unintended consequences. For example, subsidized electricity for irrigation can lead to over-extraction of groundwater, contributing to environmental degradation in regions like Punjab. Similarly, excessive fertilizer use, encouraged by subsidies, can damage soil health and pollute water bodies.", "normalised": "Furthermore, subsidies can distort market signals and create unintended consequences.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of subsidy programs in India hinges on striking a balance between achieving social equity and ensuring fiscal sustainability. Reforms are needed to improve targeting, enhance efficiency, and minimize distortions. This involves leveraging technology, strengthening monitoring mechanisms, and promoting greater awareness among beneficiaries. The implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on 01/07/2017 was also a step towards rationalizing indirect tax subsidies embedded in the previous system. A comprehensive review of all existing subsidy programs is crucial to identify areas for improvement and ensure that these interventions are effectively contributing to India's long-term development goals. Imagine a meeting at NITI Aayog at 15:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, discussing just such a review. This review needs to be completed by 31/12/2024, to allow for budget changes in the following financial year.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of subsidy programs in India hinges on striking a balance between achieving social equity and ensuring fiscal sustainability.
