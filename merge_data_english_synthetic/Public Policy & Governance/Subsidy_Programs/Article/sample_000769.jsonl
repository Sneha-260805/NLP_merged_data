{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent areas where subsidies are prevalent is agriculture. The Indian government provides subsidies on fertilizers, irrigation, electricity, and seeds to farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders. These subsidies, often implemented through schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), aim to enhance agricultural productivity, ensure food security, and improve the livelihoods of rural populations. However, concerns persist regarding the equitable distribution of these benefits and their potential to distort market prices. For instance, excessive fertilizer usage, incentivized by subsidies, can lead to soil degradation and environmental damage.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent areas where subsidies are prevalent is agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a crucial role in the energy sector. Subsidized LPG cylinders, kerosene, and electricity are provided to households, particularly those below the poverty line, to ensure access to essential energy resources. These subsidies are vital for maintaining affordability and preventing energy poverty. Initiatives like the Ujjwala Yojana, providing subsidized LPG connections to women in BPL households, have significantly expanded access to clean cooking fuels. However, challenges remain in targeting beneficiaries effectively and preventing leakage and diversion of subsidized products.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a crucial role in the energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "Education is another sector where subsidies are widely used. Various schemes offer scholarships, tuition fee waivers, and subsidized educational materials to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These subsidies aim to improve access to education, promote social mobility, and enhance human capital development. Similarly, in healthcare, government-sponsored insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat provide subsidized medical treatment to millions of families, reducing their financial burden during times of illness.", "normalised": "Education is another sector where subsidies are widely used.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of subsidy programs is complex and multifaceted. While they undoubtedly contribute to poverty reduction and improved living standards for many, they also pose significant fiscal challenges. The sheer scale of subsidies in India requires substantial budgetary allocations, potentially crowding out other essential public investments. Moreover, poorly designed subsidy programs can lead to inefficiencies, corruption, and unintended consequences.", "normalised": "The impact of subsidy programs is complex and multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs often revolves around striking a balance between providing essential support to vulnerable populations and ensuring fiscal prudence and economic efficiency. Reforming existing subsidy programs, improving targeting mechanisms, and promoting transparency and accountability are crucial for maximizing their positive impact. Perhaps a dish of biryani, spiced just right, is needed to find the perfect balance – not too much spice, not too bland, but just right for everyone. The celebration of Onam in Kerala, too, highlights the importance of equitable distribution and social harmony – principles that should guide the design and implementation of subsidy programs. Careful consideration must be given to the long-term sustainability of these programs and their impact on the overall economy, including the fiscal deficit which currently hovers around Rs. 17.7 lakh crore. The goal should be to create a system where subsidies are targeted, efficient, and contribute to a more equitable and prosperous India, even if some villages are located more than 500 km from urban centers.", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs often revolves around striking a balance between providing essential support to vulnerable populations and ensuring fiscal prudence and economic efficiency.
