{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidy programs are prevalent across various sectors. The agricultural sector is heavily reliant on subsidies for fertilizers, irrigation, and electricity. For example, the fertilizer subsidy aims to make fertilizers affordable for farmers, boosting crop yields and ensuring food security. However, the efficiency and environmental impact of fertilizer subsidies have been subject to much debate. Many argue for a shift towards direct benefit transfers (DBT) like PM-KISAN launched on 24/02/2019, which provides direct income support of Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers, bypassing intermediaries and reducing leakages.", "normalised": "In India, subsidy programs are prevalent across various sectors.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area where subsidies play a crucial role is in the energy sector. Subsidized LPG cylinders, aimed at making clean cooking fuel accessible to low-income households, are a prime example. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, launched in 2016, further expanded access to LPG by providing subsidized connections to women from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. While this initiative has significantly reduced indoor air pollution and improved health outcomes, the long-term sustainability of the subsidy model is a concern.", "normalised": "Another significant area where subsidies play a crucial role is in the energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "Education is also an area where the Indian government provides substantial subsidies. From subsidized tuition fees in government schools and colleges to scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, these programs aim to promote equitable access to education and improve literacy rates. The Right to Education Act, implemented from 01/04/2010, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years, effectively providing a massive education subsidy.", "normalised": "Education is also an area where the Indian government provides substantial subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. Leakages, inefficiencies, and unintended consequences are common concerns. Targeted subsidies, which aim to reach specific beneficiaries, often face difficulties in accurate identification and exclusion errors. Universal subsidies, on the other hand, while easier to administer, can be fiscally unsustainable and benefit even those who do not need them. Furthermore, subsidies can distort markets, leading to resource misallocation and hindering long-term economic growth. The complexities of subsidy administration were highlighted during the 2012 Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report regarding petroleum subsidies.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Effective governance of subsidy programs requires careful planning, robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and a commitment to transparency and accountability. Regular audits, impact assessments, and public consultations are essential to ensure that subsidies achieve their intended objectives and represent a judicious use of public funds. Modernizing the Public Distribution System (PDS) with technology, such as Aadhaar-linked identification and electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices, has been instrumental in reducing leakages and improving efficiency in food subsidy distribution. Future policy changes should focus on streamlining subsidy delivery mechanisms, promoting evidence-based decision-making, and fostering a culture of fiscal responsibility. Meeting scheduled program reviews by 17:00 hrs on the last day of each quarter is critical for effective governance. The success of Indian public policy hinges on the intelligent design and effective implementation of these vital, yet complex, subsidy programs.", "normalised": "Effective governance of subsidy programs requires careful planning, robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and a commitment to transparency and accountability.
