{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial component of public policy and governance in India, serving as instrumental tools for achieving diverse socio-economic objectives. These programs, characterized by direct or indirect financial assistance from the government, are designed to incentivize specific behaviors, industries, or consumer activities. Their implementation, however, necessitates careful consideration of efficiency, equity, and potential unintended consequences.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial component of public policy and governance in India, serving as instrumental tools for achieving diverse socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "India's subsidy landscape is vast and varied, encompassing sectors like agriculture, energy, and food security. The agricultural sector, a cornerstone of the Indian economy, receives substantial subsidies through initiatives like subsidized fertilizer prices and irrigation schemes. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) provides direct income support to farmers, though its impact on overall agricultural productivity remains a subject of ongoing debate. These interventions aim to ensure food security and support the livelihoods of millions of farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders.", "normalised": "India's subsidy landscape is vast and varied, encompassing sectors like agriculture, energy, and food security.

{"unnormalised": "The energy sector similarly benefits from significant subsidies, primarily aimed at making electricity and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) more affordable to households. The Ujjwala Yojana, for instance, provides subsidized LPG connections to women from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. While these subsidies aim to improve access to essential services and reduce reliance on polluting fuels, they also present challenges related to fiscal sustainability and potential market distortions. Critics argue that poorly targeted subsidies can benefit unintended recipients and discourage efficient resource allocation.", "normalised": "The energy sector similarly benefits from significant subsidies, primarily aimed at making electricity and L P G (liquefied petroleum gas) more affordable to households.

{"unnormalised": "Food security in India is bolstered by the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains to a large segment of the population. The National Food Security Act, 2013, further strengthened this safety net, ensuring access to subsidized food for a significant proportion of the population. This plays a vital role in combating hunger and malnutrition, especially amongst vulnerable populations across states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Many festivals such as Onam see an increased demand for rice, impacting PDS distribution and supply chain management.", "normalised": "Food security in India is bolstered by the Public Distribution System (P D S), which provides subsidized food grains to a large segment of the population.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is often evaluated based on various metrics, including their impact on poverty reduction, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. However, leakages, inefficiencies, and targeting errors remain significant concerns. For instance, reports suggest that a substantial portion of subsidized fertilizer fails to reach intended beneficiaries.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is often evaluated based on various metrics, including their impact on poverty reduction, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to subsidy design and implementation. This includes leveraging technology to improve targeting accuracy, promoting greater transparency and accountability, and conducting rigorous impact assessments to evaluate program effectiveness. Furthermore, exploring alternative mechanisms, such as direct benefit transfers (DBT), to reduce leakages and improve efficiency is critical. Rethinking subsidy structures, for example, offering subsidies on nutritious grains rather than only on rice and wheat, could have a more significant impact on public health. Policy decisions regarding subsidies should consider the long-term fiscal implications and strive for a balance between social welfare objectives and economic efficiency. A plate of steaming biryani, enjoyed during Eid, should not become unattainable due to subsidy-induced price distortions. The objective is to create a system where subsidies contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth, benefitting all sections of Indian society.", "normalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to subsidy design and implementation.
