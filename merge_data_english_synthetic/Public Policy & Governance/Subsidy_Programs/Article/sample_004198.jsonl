{"unnormalised": "One prominent example is the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains, like rice and wheat, to eligible households through a network of fair price shops. This program, rooted in the post-independence era, aims to ensure food security for millions of Indians, particularly those living below the poverty line. The effectiveness of the PDS, however, is often debated, with concerns raised regarding leakages, inefficiencies, and targeting errors.", "normalised": "One prominent example is the Public Distribution System (P D S), which provides subsidized food grains, like rice and wheat, to eligible households through a network of fair price shops.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural subsidies also play a crucial role in India's economy. Farmers receive subsidies on fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation, intended to boost agricultural production and ensure the viability of farming as a profession. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), for instance, provides income support of Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers. While intended to alleviate agrarian distress, these subsidies can also lead to unsustainable agricultural practices, such as excessive water consumption in states like Punjab and Haryana, and distorted market prices.", "normalised": "Agricultural subsidies also play a crucial role in India's economy.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is often evaluated through cost-benefit analysis, impact assessments, and independent audits. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) plays a critical role in scrutinizing government expenditure, including subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The fiscal burden of subsidies is substantial, impacting the government's ability to invest in other critical areas like infrastructure development. Furthermore, poorly designed subsidies can create distortions in the market, leading to unintended consequences.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "As India progresses, there is a need for a more targeted and efficient approach to subsidy programs. This includes better identification of beneficiaries, leveraging technology for improved delivery, and promoting greater awareness about the long-term implications of subsidies. Policies should aim to encourage sustainable practices and incentivize self-reliance, rather than creating dependency. Imagine enjoying a delicious Onam Sadhya; the ingredients, from rice to vegetables, may have benefited from some form of agricultural subsidy along the way. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and prosperous society where the need for subsidies is gradually reduced, paving the way for a self-reliant and sustainable future.", "normalised": "As India progresses, there is a need for a more targeted and efficient approach to subsidy programs.
