{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs form a significant component of India's public policy landscape, acting as vital instruments for achieving socio-economic objectives. These programs, ranging from agricultural support to energy assistance, aim to correct market failures, promote equity, and stimulate specific sectors of the economy.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism for agricultural produce. Under this scheme, the government, typically through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), procures crops from farmers at a pre-determined price, often exceeding market rates. This subsidy aims to provide income security to farmers, incentivizes agricultural production, and ensures food security for the nation. However, the MSP system has also been criticized for distorting market signals, leading to overproduction of certain crops like rice and wheat, and putting strain on the national exchequer. Discussions frequently revolve around reforming the MSP to be more efficient and sustainable, possibly through direct benefit transfers like the PM-KISAN scheme, which provides Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers in three installments.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs form a significant component of India's public policy landscape, acting as vital instruments for achieving socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidy programs also extend to sectors like petroleum and electricity. The LPG subsidy, aimed at providing affordable cooking fuel to households, particularly in rural areas, has undergone significant reforms in recent years. The \"Give it Up\" campaign, encouraging economically sound consumers to voluntarily forgo their subsidy, has been a notable initiative. However, ensuring equitable access to affordable energy, particularly for vulnerable populations, remains a key challenge. Power subsidies for agricultural irrigation, prevalent in states like Punjab and Haryana, while intended to boost agricultural output, often lead to over-extraction of groundwater and inefficient energy usage.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the Minimum Support Price (M S P) mechanism for agricultural produce.

{"unnormalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is often evaluated by institutions like the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), which conducts research on their economic impact and fiscal implications. Analyses often reveal unintended consequences, leakages, and targeting errors that undermine the intended benefits. Effective governance demands robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, incorporating feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders. Furthermore, the need for transparency and accountability is paramount. As the Bollywood film \"Swades\" highlighted, sustainable development requires empowerment and participation, not just handouts. Therefore, subsidy programs need to be designed to empower citizens and foster long-term self-sufficiency, rather than creating dependency. The challenge lies in striking a balance between providing essential support and promoting sustainable economic growth and fiscal responsibility, ensuring that the benefits reach the intended beneficiaries efficiently and effectively. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act serves as a reminder of the need for responsible fiscal management while addressing the needs of the populace through these vital subsidy programs.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidy programs also extend to sectors like petroleum and electricity.
