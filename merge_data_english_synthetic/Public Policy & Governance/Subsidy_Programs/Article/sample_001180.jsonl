Understanding the nuances of these subsidies is vital for informed governance and effective resource allocation.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India form a crucial component of public policy, aiming to address market failures, promote socio-economic equity, and stimulate specific sectors of the economy.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, India's subsidy regime has deep roots, particularly in agriculture. The Green Revolution in the 1960s, aimed at boosting food production, heavily relied on input subsidies for fertilizers, irrigation, and electricity. While this significantly increased agricultural output, it also led to distortions like over-reliance on water-intensive crops in states like Punjab and Haryana, creating long-term environmental challenges. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime, another form of agricultural subsidy, guarantees a price for certain crops, incentivizing production but sometimes leading to surplus stock and storage issues for the Food Corporation of India (FCI).", "normalised": "Historically, India's subsidy regime has deep roots, particularly in agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies extend to various sectors. For example, petroleum subsidies, designed to shield consumers from volatile global oil prices, have been a significant drain on the exchequer. The Janani Suraksha Yojana, a maternal health scheme, offers conditional cash transfers to encourage institutional deliveries, thereby reducing maternal mortality rates. Similarly, subsidies are provided for renewable energy projects, such as solar parks in Rajasthan, to promote sustainable development and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies extend to various sectors.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of constant debate. Critics often point to leakages, corruption, and inefficient targeting as major drawbacks. For example, studies have shown that a significant portion of subsidized food grains under the Public Distribution System (PDS) does not reach the intended beneficiaries, diverted through illicit channels. The Aadhar-linked Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, implemented nationwide by 09:00 hrs on 26/01/2013, was a major step towards addressing these leakages by directly transferring subsidies to beneficiaries' bank accounts.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of constant debate.

They highlight the role of subsidies in improving access to essential services like education, healthcare, and affordable housing for vulnerable sections of society. Furthermore, they contend that targeted subsidies can stimulate innovation and investment in strategic sectors. The recent production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, launched in 2020 with an outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore, is aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and attracting foreign investment in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and electronics.", "normalised": "However, proponents argue that subsidies are essential for social justice and inclusive growth.

{"unnormalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs requires a comprehensive approach, considering both their intended outcomes and unintended consequences. Policymakers in institutions like NITI Aayog are constantly striving to refine these programs, ensuring better targeting, reduced leakages, and improved efficiency. For instance, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), providing Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, aims to provide direct income support, supplementing their earnings and reducing their dependence on exploitative moneylenders by 15/08/2022.", "normalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs requires a comprehensive approach, considering both their intended outcomes and unintended consequences.
