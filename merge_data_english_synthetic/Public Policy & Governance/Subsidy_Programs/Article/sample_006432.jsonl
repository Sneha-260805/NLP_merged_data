{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidy schemes are prevalent across diverse sectors. Agriculture, for instance, benefits significantly from subsidized fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, directly bolstering their income. These measures aim to enhance agricultural productivity, ensure food security, and alleviate rural poverty. However, concerns persist regarding the efficiency and equity of agricultural subsidies, with some arguing that they disproportionately benefit larger landowners.", "normalised": "In India, subsidy schemes are prevalent across diverse sectors.

{"unnormalised": "The energy sector also relies heavily on subsidies, particularly for LPG and electricity. These subsidies are designed to make essential energy sources affordable for low-income households. The Ujjwala Yojana, for example, provides subsidized LPG connections to women from BPL families. While these interventions improve access to energy, they can also contribute to fiscal deficits and environmental degradation. Rationalizing energy subsidies remains a significant policy challenge.", "normalised": "The energy sector also relies heavily on subsidies, particularly for L P G and electricity.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, refining subsidy programs requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes rigorous impact assessments, better targeting of beneficiaries, improved monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and a gradual shift towards market-based solutions where feasible. The festive season of Onam, for instance, sees subsidized food grains distributed through the Public Distribution System in Kerala, demonstrating how subsidies can be integrated with cultural practices. However, ensuring these subsidies reach the intended recipients without leakage is paramount. Balancing the need for social welfare with fiscal prudence remains a key challenge for policymakers in India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, refining subsidy programs requires a multi-pronged approach.
