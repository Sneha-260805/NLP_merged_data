{"unnormalised": "In agriculture, for instance, subsidies on fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for key crops are designed to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure food security for the nation's burgeoning population. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), a direct income support scheme providing Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, exemplifies the government's commitment to alleviating agrarian distress. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these agricultural subsidies are often debated, with concerns raised about their impact on environmental sustainability, market distortions, and the financial burden on the exchequer. Critics argue for a shift towards more targeted and sustainable support mechanisms.", "normalised": "In agriculture, for instance, subsidies on fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and Minimum Support Prices (M S P s) for key crops are designed to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure food security for the nation's burgeoning population.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidy programs play a crucial role in promoting industrial growth and technological advancement. Incentives offered under schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for electronics manufacturing encourage domestic production, attract foreign investment, and boost exports.

The Public Distribution System (PDS), providing subsidized food grains to eligible households, is a prime example of a welfare-oriented subsidy program.

{"unnormalised": "The administration and evaluation of subsidy programs present significant challenges for policymakers. Leakage, corruption, and targeting errors can undermine the intended impact of these interventions. Robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, coupled with transparent and accountable governance structures, are essential to ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries and achieve their desired outcomes. Institutions like the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) play a key role in providing policy recommendations and conducting impact assessments of various subsidy schemes.", "normalised": "The administration and evaluation of subsidy programs present significant challenges for policymakers.

{"unnormalised": "The long-term sustainability of subsidy programs is also a critical consideration. As India strives towards achieving its developmental goals, it is imperative to strike a balance between providing essential support and promoting fiscal prudence. A well-designed subsidy regime, guided by evidence-based policymaking and effective implementation, can be a powerful tool for achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development. Rationalizing subsidies, improving targeting, and promoting market-based solutions are essential steps towards ensuring the effectiveness and long-term viability of these interventions.", "normalised": "The long-term sustainability of subsidy programs is also a critical consideration.
