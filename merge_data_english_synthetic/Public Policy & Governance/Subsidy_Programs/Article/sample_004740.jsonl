{"unnormalised": "A common example is the subsidy on fertilizers provided to farmers. This reduces the cost of inputs, encouraging agricultural production and ensuring food security for a nation of over 1.4 billion people. Another critical area is the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains to vulnerable sections of society through fair price shops. The targeted PDS, implemented in phases starting from 1997, aims to reach the neediest families.", "normalised": "A common example is the subsidy on fertilizers provided to farmers.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. One major concern is the fiscal burden they place on the government exchequer. The total expenditure on subsidies in India can be substantial, potentially diverting resources from other crucial areas like infrastructure development and healthcare. For instance, the fertilizer subsidy alone can run into several thousand Crores of Rupees annually.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, leakages and inefficiencies can plague these programs. Subsidized goods might not always reach the intended beneficiaries, leading to corruption and wastage. Identifying and addressing these leakages is a constant challenge for policymakers. The introduction of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, where subsidies are directly credited to beneficiaries’ bank accounts, is a step towards minimizing these inefficiencies. The Jan Dhan Yojana, launched on 28/08/2014, was crucial in enabling wider adoption of DBT.", "normalised": "Furthermore, leakages and inefficiencies can plague these programs.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidies often revolves around their effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Some argue that they create a dependency culture and distort market mechanisms. Others maintain that they are essential for social equity and inclusive growth, especially in a developing country like India with significant income disparities.", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidies often revolves around their effectiveness and long-term sustainability.

{"unnormalised": "Consider the case of electricity subsidies for agricultural use. While intended to support farmers, they can lead to over-extraction of groundwater and unsustainable agricultural practices. A more targeted and efficient approach, perhaps focusing on promoting water conservation techniques, might be a better long-term solution. A recent study by IIM Ahmedabad, published at 16:00 hrs on 10/10/2023, highlighted the urgent need for reforms in the power subsidy sector to promote environmental sustainability.", "normalised": "Consider the case of electricity subsidies for agricultural use.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the design and implementation of effective subsidy programs require careful consideration of various factors, including the intended beneficiaries, the potential economic and social impacts, and the administrative feasibility. Regular monitoring and evaluation are also crucial to ensure that these programs achieve their objectives and remain aligned with the evolving needs of the country. For instance, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted in 2013, undergoes periodic reviews to assess its effectiveness in ensuring food security. The next review is scheduled for 15/08/2024.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the design and implementation of effective subsidy programs require careful consideration of various factors, including the intended beneficiaries, the potential economic and social impacts, and the administrative feasibility.
