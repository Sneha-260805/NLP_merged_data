{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs constitute a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, influencing various sectors from agriculture to energy. These interventions, designed to lower costs for consumers or producers, aim to achieve specific socio-economic objectives. While lauded for their role in poverty alleviation and stimulating economic growth, they also present significant challenges regarding fiscal sustainability and efficient resource allocation.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs constitute a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, influencing various sectors from agriculture to energy.

{"unnormalised": "One prevalent example is the agricultural subsidy program, providing subsidized fertilizer, irrigation, and electricity to farmers. This support, vital for ensuring food security in a nation with a vast agricultural base, has historically boosted crop yields. However, the indiscriminate nature of these subsidies often leads to overuse, depleting groundwater resources in states like Punjab and Haryana, and distorting market prices for agricultural commodities. Furthermore, the substantial fiscal burden of these agricultural subsidies necessitates a continuous re-evaluation of their design and implementation.", "normalised": "One prevalent example is the agricultural subsidy program, providing subsidized fertilizer, irrigation, and electricity to farmers.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area is the petroleum subsidy, aimed at making essential fuels like kerosene and LPG affordable, especially for lower-income households. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, for example, provides subsidized LPG connections to women below the poverty line, improving their access to clean cooking fuel and reducing health hazards associated with traditional cooking methods. However, leakages in the distribution system and diversion of subsidized fuel to commercial entities remain persistent problems. A Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, where subsidies are directly credited to beneficiaries' bank accounts, is aimed at plugging these leakages and ensuring better targeting.", "normalised": "Another significant area is the petroleum subsidy, aimed at making essential fuels like kerosene and L P G affordable, especially for lower-income households.

{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs in India often intersect with cultural practices and traditions. For instance, the Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains to eligible households, plays a crucial role in ensuring access to basic nutrition, especially during festivals. Imagine the role PDS plays in ensuring access to rice for Onam Sadhya in Kerala, or providing ingredients for biryani across households in Hyderabad. These programs provide a safety net for vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India often intersect with cultural practices and traditions.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is constantly debated. Critics argue that they create market distortions, discourage efficiency, and lead to fiscal deficits. The fiscal deficit in India, often exceeding 3% of GDP, is significantly impacted by the sheer volume of subsidies. Proponents, on the other hand, emphasize their crucial role in addressing inequality, promoting social justice, and supporting strategic sectors.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is constantly debated.

{"unnormalised": "A balanced approach is crucial. This involves better targeting mechanisms to ensure that benefits reach intended beneficiaries, promoting efficient resource utilization through improved infrastructure and technology, and exploring alternative policy instruments that can achieve similar objectives with lower fiscal costs. Regular audits and impact assessments are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of subsidy programs and make necessary adjustments. The Government of India allocated Rs. 2,00,000 crore towards major subsidies in the 2023-24 budget, highlighting the continued importance and scale of these interventions. Moving forward, a data-driven and evidence-based approach is necessary to ensure that subsidy programs contribute effectively to India's sustainable and inclusive development goals.", "normalised": "A balanced approach is crucial.

Regular audits and impact assessments are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of subsidy programs and make necessary adjustments. The Government of India allocated rupees two hundred thousand crore towards major subsidies in the two thousand twenty three to twenty four budget, highlighting the continued importance and scale of these interventions.
