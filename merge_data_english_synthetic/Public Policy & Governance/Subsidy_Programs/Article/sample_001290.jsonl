{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs in India constitute a significant component of public policy and governance, designed to achieve socio-economic objectives ranging from poverty alleviation to agricultural development. These interventions, often implemented through direct financial assistance, tax breaks, or price controls, aim to correct market failures, promote specific industries, and ensure equitable access to essential goods and services for vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India constitute a significant component of public policy and governance, designed to achieve socio-economic objectives ranging from poverty alleviation to agricultural development.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian landscape is replete with diverse subsidy schemes. The Public Distribution System (PDS), for instance, provides subsidized food grains like rice and wheat to millions of households below the poverty line, ensuring food security. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), while not strictly a subsidy in its purest form, effectively subsidizes rural employment by guaranteeing 100 days of work per household at a minimum wage. Agricultural subsidies, encompassing input subsidies on fertilizers, irrigation, and electricity, are critical for supporting farmers and boosting agricultural productivity. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides direct income support of Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers in three installments.", "normalised": "The Indian landscape is replete with diverse subsidy schemes.

{"unnormalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate. While proponents emphasize their crucial role in addressing inequality and promoting inclusive growth, critics raise concerns about their fiscal burden, potential for leakages and corruption, and distortionary effects on market mechanisms. The Economic Survey of India frequently addresses the issue of \"merit goods\" versus \"non-merit goods\" when assessing the effectiveness of subsidies, questioning the rationale behind subsidies that primarily benefit the relatively well-off.", "normalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate.

{"unnormalised": "The political economy of subsidies is complex. Successive governments have been hesitant to significantly reduce subsidies due to their perceived political sensitivity. As depicted in the Bollywood film \"Swades\", the dependence of rural communities on government support, although sometimes inefficiently delivered, can be deeply entrenched. Reforming subsidies requires a delicate balance between economic efficiency and social equity, necessitating careful consideration of the potential impact on the most vulnerable sections of society. For example, the subsidy on Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, while intended to benefit the poor, often disproportionately benefits wealthier households. Gradual reforms, coupled with targeted assistance programs, are essential to ensure that subsidy programs contribute effectively to India's long-term development goals. Subsidies on electric vehicles (EVs) are also being promoted to reduce pollution in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, aiming for a targeted reduction of PM2.5 levels by 10% within 5 years.", "normalised": "The political economy of subsidies is complex.
