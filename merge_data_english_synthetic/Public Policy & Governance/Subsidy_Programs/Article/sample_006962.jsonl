{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, aimed at achieving various socio-economic objectives. A subsidy, in its simplest form, is a financial assistance provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or other institutions. These interventions aim to lower the cost of a particular good or service, thereby making it more accessible or competitive.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of Indian public policy and governance, aimed at achieving various socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "In India, the rationale behind subsidies stems from a historical context of pervasive poverty and inequality. The government uses these programs to uplift marginalized communities, promote food security, and stimulate economic growth. Prominent examples include subsidies on food, fertilizers, and fuel. The Public Distribution System (PDS), for instance, provides subsidized food grains to millions of families below the poverty line, ensuring that even the poorest have access to essential sustenance. This system has been around since before independence, with significant revamps occurring periodically, including a major one around 2013.", "normalised": "In India, the rationale behind subsidies stems from a historical context of pervasive poverty and inequality.

{"unnormalised": "Fertilizer subsidies aim to encourage farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices, increasing productivity and ensuring food security. While these subsidies have undeniably contributed to increased agricultural output, they have also faced criticism for distorting market prices and contributing to environmental degradation through overuse of subsidized fertilizers. Discussions on reforming these subsidies are constantly ongoing.", "normalised": "Fertilizer subsidies aim to encourage farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices, increasing productivity and ensuring food security.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel subsidies, though intended to cushion consumers from fluctuating global oil prices, have been particularly contentious. The hefty financial burden these subsidies place on the government exchequer has often led to calls for phased deregulation and a shift towards direct benefit transfers (DBT), where the subsidy amount is directly credited to the beneficiary's account. Implementing these changes takes considerable time and political capital.", "normalised": "Fuel subsidies, though intended to cushion consumers from fluctuating global oil prices, have been particularly contentious.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of constant debate. While proponents emphasize their role in poverty alleviation and economic empowerment, critics point to issues of leakages, inefficiencies, and unintended consequences. Leakages refer to instances where subsidized goods or services are diverted to unintended beneficiaries, often due to corruption or poor monitoring. For example, subsidized kerosene intended for rural households might find its way into the black market.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of constant debate.

{"unnormalised": "To address these challenges, the government has been increasingly focusing on DBT schemes, leveraging technology to improve targeting and reduce leakages. The Aadhaar-linked DBT scheme for LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) cylinders, launched on 01/01/2013, is a prime example. Furthermore, initiatives like JAM trinity (Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and Mobile) aim to create a robust financial inclusion ecosystem that can facilitate efficient delivery of subsidies and other government benefits.", "normalised": "To address these challenges, the government has been increasingly focusing on D B T schemes, leveraging technology to improve targeting and reduce leakages.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring universal access to Aadhaar, particularly in remote areas, and addressing concerns about data privacy are crucial for the success of DBT schemes. Moreover, simply transferring money may not be sufficient to address underlying issues of poverty and inequality. Integrated development programs that focus on education, healthcare, and skill development are also essential.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, enacted with the goal of reducing India’s fiscal deficit, also places constraints on the extent of subsidies the government can provide. Periodic reviews of subsidy schemes are therefore necessary to assess their impact, identify inefficiencies, and ensure that they align with broader development goals. An important review happened, for example, around 10:00 hrs on 15/08/2015, to discuss the feasibility of various schemes. Another review is expected by 31/12/2024, concerning agricultural input subsidies. Ultimately, designing effective and equitable subsidy programs requires a nuanced understanding of the Indian context, a commitment to transparency and accountability, and a willingness to adapt and innovate. The spirit of \"Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan\" should be imbibed in the implementation of every public policy decision.", "normalised": "The F R B M Act, enacted with the goal of reducing India’s fiscal deficit, also places constraints on the extent of subsidies the government can provide.
