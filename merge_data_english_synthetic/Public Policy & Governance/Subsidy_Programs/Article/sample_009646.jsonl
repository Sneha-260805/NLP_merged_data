{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, serving as a key instrument to achieve socio-economic objectives. From supporting agricultural production to promoting access to essential services, these interventions play a vital role in shaping the nation's developmental trajectory. However, their design, implementation, and evaluation require careful consideration to maximize effectiveness and minimize unintended consequences.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, serving as a key instrument to achieve socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "A primary goal of subsidies in India is to support vulnerable populations. The Public Distribution System (PDS), for example, provides subsidized food grains to millions of families below the poverty line, ensuring food security and alleviating hunger. Similarly, fertilizer subsidies are intended to boost agricultural productivity by making essential inputs more affordable for farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders. These programs, while aiming to improve the lives of the less fortunate, often face challenges related to leakage, targeting errors, and overall efficiency.", "normalised": "A primary goal of subsidies in India is to support vulnerable populations.

{"unnormalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers and economists. Critics often point to the fiscal burden they impose on the government exchequer. The annual budget allocation for major subsidies, including food, fertilizer, and petroleum, can run into hundreds of thousands of crores of Rupees. This expenditure can strain public finances and divert resources from other crucial sectors like healthcare and education. The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) has conducted extensive research on the economic impact of subsidies in India, highlighting both their benefits and drawbacks.", "normalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers and economists.

For instance, subsidized electricity for agriculture can lead to over-extraction of groundwater, depleting precious water resources. Similarly, untargeted subsidies can benefit unintended recipients, leading to rent-seeking and corruption. The film \"Swades\" poignantly portrays the challenges faced by rural communities due to systemic inefficiencies and the importance of sustainable solutions rather than mere handouts.", "normalised": "Furthermore, poorly designed subsidies can create distortions in the market.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, the focus should be on reforming existing subsidy programs to make them more targeted, efficient, and sustainable. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, which transfer subsidies directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, have shown promise in reducing leakage and improving transparency. Leveraging technology, such as Aadhaar-based identification and mobile-based monitoring, can further enhance the effectiveness of these programs. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach that combines targeted subsidies with investments in infrastructure, education, and skill development is essential for achieving inclusive and sustainable growth in India. This includes promoting farmer education programs in areas such as Haryana, where new irrigation techniques can reduce their reliance on subsidized electricity and conserve groundwater. The goal is not to eliminate subsidies entirely, but to ensure they are used judiciously and contribute to long-term development outcomes.", "normalised": "Moving forward, the focus should be on reforming existing subsidy programs to make them more targeted, efficient, and sustainable.
