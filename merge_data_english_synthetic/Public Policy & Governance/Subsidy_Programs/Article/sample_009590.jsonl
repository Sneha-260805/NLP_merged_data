{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidies play a significant role in various sectors. Agriculture is a prime example. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) offered to farmers for crops like rice and wheat, ensuring a guaranteed price irrespective of market fluctuations, is a form of subsidy. This aims to protect farmers from price volatility and incentivize agricultural production, crucial for food security. Fertiliser subsidies, offered since the Green Revolution era, were instrumental in boosting crop yields, although their environmental impact is now under intense scrutiny. These programs often face challenges such as leakages and unequal distribution, benefitting larger landholders more than marginal farmers. The deadline for linking Aadhaar to fertilizer purchases was extended to 31/12/2023 to address some of these issues.", "normalised": "In India, subsidies play a significant role in various sectors.

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), providing subsidies for affordable housing, aims to address the housing shortage in urban areas. Similarly, the LPG subsidy, particularly under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aims to provide cleaner cooking fuel to households, reducing indoor air pollution and its associated health problems, especially among women.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their drawbacks. They can strain the government exchequer, leading to higher fiscal deficits. Subsidies can also distort market prices, leading to inefficiencies and disincentivizing innovation. For instance, heavily subsidised electricity for agricultural purposes in some states encourages excessive groundwater extraction, contributing to water scarcity. The debate surrounding subsidies often centres on balancing the socio-economic benefits with the fiscal costs and unintended consequences.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their drawbacks.

{"unnormalised": "Effective implementation and monitoring are crucial for maximizing the benefits of subsidy programs. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), transferring subsidies directly into beneficiaries' bank accounts, has been a game-changer in reducing leakages and improving efficiency. However, challenges related to financial inclusion and digital literacy need to be addressed to ensure that all eligible beneficiaries, particularly those in remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, can access these benefits. Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs, say at 09:00 hrs on the 15/08/2024, through rigorous impact assessments is essential for evidence-based policymaking and course correction. The ideal scenario involves well-targeted, time-bound subsidies that promote sustainable development and empower citizens, rather than creating dependency. Rs. 20,000 Cr. has been allocated for specific schemes in the last fiscal year.", "normalised": "Effective implementation and monitoring are crucial for maximizing the benefits of subsidy programs.
