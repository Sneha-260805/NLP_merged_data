{"unnormalised": "Subsidies are a cornerstone of public policy in India, acting as financial assistance provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or institutions. They aim to reduce the burden of specific costs, promote certain activities, and achieve broader socio-economic objectives. In the Indian context, where a significant portion of the population still struggles with poverty and access to essential services, subsidies play a crucial role in welfare and development.", "normalised": "Subsidies are a cornerstone of public policy in India, acting as financial assistance provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or institutions.

{"unnormalised": "The scope of subsidy programs in India is vast and diverse. They span across various sectors, including agriculture, energy, food, education, and healthcare. For instance, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce, a longstanding practice initiated around the 1960s, guarantees a minimum price to farmers for their crops, thereby incentivizing agricultural production and ensuring food security. This, however, comes at a significant cost to the exchequer and often leads to distortions in the market.", "normalised": "The scope of subsidy programs in India is vast and diverse.

{"unnormalised": "Similarly, subsidies on fertilizers, though intended to boost agricultural output, have been criticized for promoting excessive fertilizer use, damaging soil health and impacting water resources. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, launched on 24/02/2019, provides direct income support of Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, aiming to alleviate their financial distress.", "normalised": "Similarly, subsidies on fertilizers, though intended to boost agricultural output, have been criticized for promoting excessive fertilizer use, damaging soil health and impacting water resources.

{"unnormalised": "Energy subsidies, particularly on LPG and electricity, are another major component of the Indian subsidy landscape. While these subsidies aim to make energy accessible and affordable, they often lead to inefficient consumption and environmental degradation. The Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme to provide subsidized LPG connections to women from below poverty line (BPL) families, is a noteworthy example of a targeted subsidy program in the energy sector.", "normalised": "Energy subsidies, particularly on L P G and electricity, are another major component of the Indian subsidy landscape.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate. While proponents argue that they are essential for social justice and economic development, critics point to their fiscal burden, distortionary effects, and potential for corruption. Leakage of subsidies, where benefits do not reach the intended beneficiaries, is a persistent problem. For example, ration cards, which are used to access subsidized food grains under the Public Distribution System (PDS), are often misused, with ineligible individuals benefiting from the scheme.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is a subject of ongoing debate.

{"unnormalised": "Rationalizing subsidies and improving their targeting are crucial for ensuring their effectiveness and minimizing their adverse effects. The use of technology, such as Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), which directly transfers subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts, has been shown to reduce leakages and improve transparency.
