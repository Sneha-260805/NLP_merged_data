{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the subsidy on fertilizers, aimed at supporting farmers, like Ramlal from Haryana, and boosting agricultural production. This initiative, however, is often debated due to concerns about its environmental impact and the potential for overuse of fertilizers. Similarly, subsidies on food grains, distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS), are crucial for ensuring food security for millions of vulnerable families across the country. The PDS, managed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, provides subsidized rice, wheat, and other essential commodities to eligible beneficiaries at ration shops.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the subsidy on fertilizers, aimed at supporting farmers, like Ramlal from Haryana, and boosting agricultural production.

Subsidized LPG cylinders, particularly under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aim to provide clean cooking fuel to rural households, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and improving health outcomes for women, such as Lakshmi from Uttar Pradesh. The government also provides subsidies for renewable energy projects, encouraging the adoption of solar and wind power to achieve its climate change goals.", "normalised": "Another significant area where subsidies play a vital role is in the energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of continuous evaluation. Critics often point to issues of leakages, corruption, and inefficient targeting, which can undermine their intended benefits. For instance, instances of diversion of subsidized kerosene, meant for rural households, to other purposes have been reported. Furthermore, the fiscal burden of subsidies can be substantial, impacting the government's ability to invest in other crucial areas like infrastructure development and education. The CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) regularly audits subsidy programs to identify inefficiencies and recommend improvements.", "normalised": "The efficacy of subsidy programs is a subject of continuous evaluation.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the impact of subsidies on market dynamics is a key consideration. While subsidies can make essential goods and services more affordable, they can also distort market prices and create disincentives for efficiency. The movie \"Swades\" touched upon the plight of farmers and the complexities surrounding rural development and government assistance. Striking a balance between providing necessary support and promoting market-based solutions is a constant challenge. Policymakers grapple with designing subsidy programs that are both effective and fiscally sustainable, ensuring that they reach the intended beneficiaries and contribute to long-term economic growth and social well-being. The Rs. 2000 crore investment in rural infrastructure under the MGNREGA scheme also acts as a form of indirect subsidy through employment generation.", "normalised": "Moreover, the impact of subsidies on market dynamics is a key consideration.
