{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs represent a significant pillar within India's public policy and governance framework. These programs, designed to provide financial assistance to specific sectors, industries, or individuals, aim to achieve a diverse range of socioeconomic objectives. They can be broadly categorized into agricultural subsidies, fuel subsidies, food subsidies, and export subsidies, each addressing distinct societal needs and challenges.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs represent a significant pillar within India's public policy and governance framework.

{"unnormalised": "Agricultural subsidies, for instance, are critical for supporting Indian farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders. Initiatives like subsidized fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and minimum support prices (MSP) for crops, aim to enhance agricultural productivity, ensure food security, and stabilize farmer incomes, especially in regions like Punjab and Haryana. However, concerns persist regarding their efficiency, equitable distribution, and environmental impact, particularly relating to excessive water usage for water-intensive crops like rice in states facing water scarcity.", "normalised": "Agricultural subsidies, for instance, are critical for supporting Indian farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel subsidies, predominantly targeting LPG and kerosene, aim to provide affordable energy access to vulnerable populations. While these subsidies have undeniably played a role in improving household energy access, they are often criticized for their budgetary burden, potential for leakage and diversion, and environmental consequences. The gradual implementation of direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes, such as PAHAL for LPG, has been instrumental in curbing leakages and ensuring that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries.", "normalised": "Fuel subsidies, predominantly targeting L P G and kerosene, aim to provide affordable energy access to vulnerable populations.

{"unnormalised": "The Public Distribution System (PDS), a crucial element of India's food security framework, relies heavily on food subsidies. This system aims to provide subsidized food grains, like wheat and rice, to eligible households through a network of fair price shops. Despite its wide reach, challenges remain in terms of efficient procurement, storage, and distribution, requiring continuous monitoring and reform. Films like \"Mother India,\" though a fictional narrative, poignantly depict the struggles of farmers and the importance of accessible food, highlighting the historical context surrounding the need for food security measures.", "normalised": "The Public Distribution System (P D S), a crucial element of India's food security framework, relies heavily on food subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "Export subsidies, while less prominent than other forms of subsidies, are employed to enhance the competitiveness of Indian exports in the global market. These subsidies can take various forms, including tax exemptions, concessional credit, and marketing assistance.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness and efficiency of subsidy programs are continuously debated and evaluated. Institutions like the National Institute for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) play a vital role in analyzing the impact of these programs and recommending reforms to optimize their delivery and maximize their benefits. Data from periodic surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) helps to gauge the reach and impact of various subsidy schemes on different sections of the population. Ongoing efforts focus on improving targeting mechanisms, leveraging technology to enhance transparency and accountability, and promoting sustainable practices to mitigate the unintended consequences of subsidy programs. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that subsidy programs contribute effectively to inclusive growth and sustainable development in India.", "normalised": "The effectiveness and efficiency of subsidy programs are continuously debated and evaluated.
