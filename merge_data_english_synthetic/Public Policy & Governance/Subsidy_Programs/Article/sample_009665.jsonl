{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program. This program aims to support farmers like Ramesh from Haryana, who struggle with fluctuating market prices and input costs. Subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, and electricity help them maintain their livelihoods and ensure food security for the nation. However, critics often point to the inefficiencies and leakages within the system, suggesting that a significant portion of the subsidy benefits might not reach the intended beneficiaries. The Shanta Kumar Committee report, commissioned by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), highlighted these issues and recommended reforms in the public distribution system to reduce wastage and improve targeting.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent examples is the agricultural subsidy program.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, fuel subsidies, while intended to keep fuel prices stable, often contribute to fiscal deficits and environmental degradation. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, though a positive step towards cleaner cooking fuel for rural households, is ultimately a subsidy program requiring careful monitoring and evaluation. Balancing the need for affordable energy with the imperative of sustainable development remains a key challenge for policymakers.", "normalised": "Furthermore, fuel subsidies, while intended to keep fuel prices stable, often contribute to fiscal deficits and environmental degradation.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs is often complex, as evidenced in discussions following the release of government budgets. The need to balance fiscal prudence with social welfare objectives requires a nuanced understanding of the economic and social impacts of these interventions. Are they truly empowering the marginalized, or are they creating a culture of dependency? Are they fostering sustainable development, or are they merely postponing environmental challenges?", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs is often complex, as evidenced in discussions following the release of government budgets.

{"unnormalised": "The success of any subsidy program ultimately depends on good governance and a strong commitment to accountability. Perhaps we can learn a lesson about good intentions gone awry from the characters in Bollywood films, where noble aims sometimes lead to unintended consequences due to corruption and mismanagement. Like the ideal of Ram Rajya, perfect governance remains a distant aspiration, but the pursuit of transparency and efficiency in subsidy programs is a crucial step in that direction. The estimated cost of food subsidy for FY24-25 is Rs. 2.12 lakh crore.", "normalised": "The success of any subsidy program ultimately depends on good governance and a strong commitment to accountability.
