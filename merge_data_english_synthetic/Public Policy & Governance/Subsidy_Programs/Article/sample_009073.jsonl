{"unnormalised": "The rationale behind subsidies stems from the recognition that markets often fail to deliver optimal outcomes. For instance, agricultural subsidies, such as those provided under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme for crops like rice and wheat, aim to incentivize food production and ensure food security for a nation with a large population. Subsidized fertilizers, though crucial for boosting agricultural yields, have also been criticized for their potential environmental impact and skewed usage patterns. Similarly, subsidies on LPG cylinders under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana seek to provide cleaner cooking fuel to rural households, addressing health concerns associated with traditional cooking methods.", "normalised": "The rationale behind subsidies stems from the recognition that markets often fail to deliver optimal outcomes.

This includes improving targeting mechanisms, enhancing transparency and accountability, promoting efficiency in resource allocation, and fostering greater public awareness about the costs and benefits of subsidies. A well-designed and effectively implemented subsidy regime can play a crucial role in promoting inclusive growth and sustainable development in India. Reforming subsidies is a continuous process, requiring careful consideration of trade-offs and a commitment to evidence-based policy making. Rs. 10,000 crore allocated for a specific subsidy program can be a significant sum, yet its impact depends entirely on its effective utilization and monitoring. The 500 km stretch of a new rural road built with subsidized materials exemplifies the tangible benefits that subsidies can bring, but also underscores the need for quality control and transparency in execution.", "normalised": "Addressing the challenges associated with subsidy programs requires a multi-pronged approach.
