{"unnormalised": "In agriculture, subsidies on fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and seeds are prevalent. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, providing Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, is a direct income support subsidy aiming to improve agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. While such subsidies aim to boost agricultural output and ensure food security, their effectiveness is often debated. Critics argue that these can lead to inefficient resource allocation, distort market prices, and contribute to environmental degradation, such as excessive groundwater depletion in Punjab due to subsidized electricity for irrigation.", "normalised": "In agriculture, subsidies on fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and seeds are prevalent.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies are crucial in the energy sector, particularly for LPG and kerosene, ensuring affordable access to essential fuels for low-income households. The Ujjwala Yojana, a program providing subsidized LPG connections to women below the poverty line, is a prime example of this. However, targeting these subsidies effectively remains a challenge, with leakage and diversion being persistent concerns.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies are crucial in the energy sector, particularly for L P G and kerosene, ensuring affordable access to essential fuels for low-income households.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is constantly under scrutiny. The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) regularly publishes research analyzing the economic and fiscal implications of various subsidy schemes, offering recommendations for improved targeting and efficient resource utilization. A well-designed subsidy program needs to consider its long-term impact on economic growth, fiscal sustainability, and environmental conservation. Furthermore, transparency and accountability are crucial. Regular audits and impact assessments are essential to ensure that subsidies are reaching the intended beneficiaries and achieving their intended outcomes.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs is constantly under scrutiny.

{"unnormalised": "The debate around subsidies often echoes the dilemma depicted in classic Bollywood films. Think of the struggle in \"Mother India\" - where the protagonist faces crushing debt and exploitative landlords. Subsidy programs are often presented as a solution to these kinds of systemic inequities. However, the question remains: are these subsidies truly empowering, or are they creating a system of dependence?", "normalised": "The debate around subsidies often echoes the dilemma depicted in classic Bollywood films.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the move towards Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is a significant step in improving the efficiency and transparency of subsidy delivery. By directly transferring subsidies into the beneficiaries' bank accounts, the government aims to reduce leakage and ensure that benefits reach the intended recipients. As India strives for inclusive growth and sustainable development, carefully designed and efficiently implemented subsidy programs will continue to play a critical role in shaping the nation's future, with a delicate balance between short-term relief and long-term structural reforms. The success of these programs depends on continuous evaluation, adaptation, and a commitment to good governance.", "normalised": "Finally, the move towards Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T) is a significant step in improving the efficiency and transparency of subsidy delivery.
