{"unnormalised": "The rationale behind implementing subsidies stems from addressing market failures, promoting equitable access to essential goods and services, and fostering strategic industries. For instance, fertilizer subsidies, a long-standing policy intervention in Indian agriculture, seek to ensure that farmers, particularly marginal and small landholders like those in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, can afford necessary inputs to enhance crop yields. Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), offering interest subsidies on housing loans, aims to provide affordable housing to the urban poor, addressing a critical housing shortage.", "normalised": "The rationale behind implementing subsidies stems from addressing market failures, promoting equitable access to essential goods and services, and fostering strategic industries.

{"unnormalised": "However, the implementation and management of subsidy programs are not without their challenges. One significant concern revolves around the fiscal burden they impose on the government. Subsidies often account for a substantial portion of the national budget, potentially crowding out investments in other crucial areas like education and healthcare. The Food Corporation of India (FCI), for example, manages a vast network of procurement and distribution, often incurring significant losses due to storage and transportation inefficiencies, impacting the overall food subsidy program.", "normalised": "However, the implementation and management of subsidy programs are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the targeting of subsidies remains a persistent issue. Leakages, diversion, and inclusion/exclusion errors often undermine the effectiveness of these programs. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, promoted by the NITI Aayog, represents a concerted effort to improve targeting and reduce leakages by directly transferring subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts. However, challenges related to financial inclusion and digital literacy continue to impede its full potential, especially in rural areas like those depicted in the film “Lagaan”, where access to formal financial institutions was nonexistent.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the targeting of subsidies remains a persistent issue.

For example, power subsidies in some states have contributed to unsustainable agricultural practices, such as excessive groundwater extraction, impacting long-term environmental sustainability.", "normalised": "Moreover, subsidies can sometimes distort markets, leading to unintended consequences.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs necessitates rigorous monitoring and evaluation. Independent assessments, conducted by institutions like the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), are crucial for assessing the impact of these programs on intended beneficiaries and identifying areas for improvement. Regular reviews and reforms are essential to ensure that subsidy programs remain relevant, efficient, and aligned with evolving socio-economic priorities. This includes exploring innovative approaches like conditional cash transfers and leveraging technology to enhance transparency and accountability in the delivery of these critical public services. The success of these policies hinges on robust governance and a commitment to evidence-based policymaking.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs necessitates rigorous monitoring and evaluation.
