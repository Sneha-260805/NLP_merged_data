{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a ubiquitous tool in public policy, representing a significant expenditure in the Indian context. They function as financial assistance provided by the government to specific sectors, industries, or individuals with the aim of achieving broader socio-economic objectives. These objectives often include promoting agricultural production, supporting vulnerable populations, encouraging industrial growth, and fostering innovation. Understanding their design, implementation, and impact is crucial for effective governance.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a ubiquitous tool in public policy, representing a significant expenditure in the Indian context.

{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deeply interwoven with the fabric of economic and social policies. A prime example is the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism for agricultural produce. This scheme guarantees farmers a minimum price for their crops, shielding them from market volatility and incentivizing production, vital for food security in a nation with a large population. However, the MSP also faces challenges, including potential market distortions and the accumulation of large food grain stocks at the Food Corporation of India (FCI), costing the exchequer Rs. 2.65 lakh crore in FY23 alone.", "normalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deeply interwoven with the fabric of economic and social policies.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area of subsidy provision lies in the realm of energy. Subsidized electricity tariffs, particularly for agricultural users, aim to boost irrigation and agricultural output. However, they can also lead to unsustainable water usage and financial stress on state electricity boards (SEBs). Similarly, the provision of subsidized LPG cylinders under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has expanded access to clean cooking fuel, improving health outcomes and reducing reliance on traditional biomass fuels, particularly in rural areas of states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "Another significant area of subsidy provision lies in the realm of energy.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on careful design and robust implementation. Leakages, corruption, and inefficient targeting can undermine their intended benefits. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, where subsidies are directly transferred to beneficiaries' bank accounts, represent a significant step towards reducing leakages and improving transparency. For instance, the DBT for fertilizer subsidies aims to ensure that the benefit reaches the farmers and not intermediaries.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on careful design and robust implementation.

{"unnormalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs requires rigorous analysis. While they can stimulate economic activity and improve welfare, they can also create unintended consequences. For example, excessive subsidization of fertilizers can lead to imbalanced nutrient application, harming soil health in the long run. Furthermore, the long-term fiscal implications of subsidy commitments need careful consideration, particularly in a developing economy like India with competing demands on public resources.", "normalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs requires rigorous analysis.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, a balanced approach is needed. This involves streamlining existing subsidy programs, improving targeting, and exploring alternative mechanisms that are more efficient and sustainable. This includes transitioning towards market-based solutions where possible, promoting greater awareness and accountability, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Only then can India harness the full potential of subsidy programs to achieve its developmental goals.", "normalised": "Moving forward, a balanced approach is needed.
