{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant areas for subsidies in India is agriculture. The government provides subsidies on fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation, ensuring that farmers can afford essential inputs for crop production. The aim is to boost agricultural output, ensure food security for the nation, and support the livelihoods of millions of farmers, many of whom operate on small landholdings. For example, the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme provides direct income support to farmers, supplementing their income and reducing dependence on moneylenders. While these subsidies help improve agricultural yields, critics often point out that they can lead to inefficient resource allocation, over-use of resources like water, and environmental degradation, such as excessive fertilizer use leading to soil pollution.", "normalised": "One of the most significant areas for subsidies in India is agriculture.

Subsidized LPG cylinders for domestic use are a common example, aiming to make clean cooking fuel accessible to a wider population, particularly in rural areas where reliance on traditional fuels like wood and dung cakes contribute to indoor air pollution.

{"unnormalised": "The administration and monitoring of subsidy programs are complex processes. Leakages and inefficiencies are persistent challenges. Beneficiary identification, distribution mechanisms, and accountability measures require constant refinement. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, where subsidies are directly deposited into beneficiaries' bank accounts, are increasingly used to improve transparency and reduce corruption. The implementation of DBT for LPG subsidies, for instance, has shown promising results in reducing diversion and ensuring that benefits reach the intended recipients. The government introduced the PAHAL scheme for this purpose on 01/01/2015.", "normalised": "The administration and monitoring of subsidy programs are complex processes.

{"unnormalised": "However, the fiscal burden of subsidies is substantial. Balancing the need for social welfare with fiscal prudence is a constant challenge for policymakers. Reforming subsidy programs to improve their efficiency and targeting is a continuous process. Arguments often revolve around whether subsidies should be phased out gradually or replaced with alternative forms of support, such as direct income transfers targeted at the most vulnerable sections of society. This debate intensifies during budget cycles, especially around 11:00 hrs on budget day.", "normalised": "However, the fiscal burden of subsidies is substantial.
