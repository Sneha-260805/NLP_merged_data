{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial instrument in the Indian public policy landscape, aimed at influencing economic activity, achieving social justice, and promoting specific developmental goals. They represent financial assistance provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or institutions, effectively lowering the cost of a good or service or increasing its production. In essence, subsidies are designed to bridge the gap between the market price and the desired price, making essential goods and services more accessible, especially to vulnerable sections of society.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs form a crucial instrument in the Indian public policy landscape, aimed at influencing economic activity, achieving social justice, and promoting specific developmental goals.

{"unnormalised": "In India, the scope of subsidy programs is vast and varied. A significant portion goes towards food subsidies, primarily managed through the Public Distribution System (PDS), ensuring that low-income families can access essential food grains like rice and wheat at subsidized rates. The PDS, vital in combating food insecurity, distributes grains through a network of fair price shops across the country. Furthermore, fertilizer subsidies play a pivotal role in supporting the agricultural sector. These subsidies aim to make fertilizers affordable for farmers, boosting agricultural productivity and contributing to food security. However, they have also been criticized for potentially leading to overuse and environmental degradation.", "normalised": "In India, the scope of subsidy programs is vast and varied.

{"unnormalised": "Another prominent example is the subsidy provided on LPG cylinders for domestic use. This helps to make cooking gas more affordable for households, particularly in rural areas where access to cleaner cooking fuels is crucial. The government, in its efforts to promote cleaner energy, has also introduced subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) under schemes like FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) India. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption of EVs, thereby reducing air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels. This aligns with India’s commitment to achieving its climate goals.", "normalised": "Another prominent example is the subsidy provided on L P G cylinders for domestic use.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of these subsidy programs is multifaceted. While they demonstrably improve access to essential goods and services for marginalized communities and boost key sectors like agriculture, they also present challenges. The financial burden on the exchequer is considerable. The total expenditure on subsidies in India can be substantial, impacting fiscal deficits and requiring careful fiscal management. Furthermore, leakages and inefficiencies in the delivery mechanisms can undermine the effectiveness of these programs. For instance, reports often highlight instances of subsidized grains being diverted to the open market instead of reaching intended beneficiaries.", "normalised": "The impact of these subsidy programs is multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs in India is ongoing. Economists and policymakers grapple with questions regarding their optimal design, targeting, and monitoring. Reforms are often suggested to improve efficiency, reduce leakages, and ensure that subsidies reach those who genuinely need them. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, which transfer subsidy amounts directly into the bank accounts of beneficiaries, are increasingly being adopted to enhance transparency and reduce corruption. The first DBT scheme was launched on 01/01/2013.", "normalised": "The debate surrounding subsidy programs in India is ongoing.

{"unnormalised": "The design and implementation of subsidy programs require careful consideration of various factors, including economic feasibility, social equity, and environmental sustainability. The challenge lies in striking a balance between the need to provide support to vulnerable sections and the need to maintain fiscal prudence and environmental responsibility. A constant evaluation of these programs is essential to ensure they are achieving their intended objectives and contributing to inclusive and sustainable development. For example, the impact of the revised fertilizer subsidy scheme implemented after 09:00 hrs on 26/05/2021, needs continuous assessment. The government's report on the effectiveness of the PDS by 15/08/2024 will also be crucial for future policy adjustments.", "normalised": "The design and implementation of subsidy programs require careful consideration of various factors, including economic feasibility, social equity, and environmental sustainability.
