{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, acting as vital instruments to achieve socio-economic objectives. They involve the government providing financial assistance, often in the form of cash, tax breaks, or subsidized goods and services, to specific sectors, individuals, or communities. These interventions aim to correct market failures, promote equity, and stimulate economic growth, but are frequently subject to debate regarding their effectiveness and impact on fiscal stability.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy and governance in India, acting as vital instruments to achieve socio-economic objectives.

{"unnormalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deeply interwoven with the nation’s development trajectory. Agriculture, being a crucial sector, receives significant support through subsidized fertilizers, electricity for irrigation, and crop insurance schemes. The aim is to boost agricultural productivity, ensure food security, and improve the livelihoods of farmers, especially small and marginal landholders like those in rural Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), launched on 01/12/2018, provides income support of Rs. 6,000 per year to eligible farmer families, directly addressing their financial vulnerabilities. However, the effectiveness of fertilizer subsidies has been questioned, with concerns about their impact on soil health and the potential for diversion.", "normalised": "In India, subsidy programs are deeply interwoven with the nation’s development trajectory.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a significant role in social welfare programs. The Public Distribution System (PDS) ensures access to subsidized food grains for vulnerable populations, combatting hunger and malnutrition. Schemes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provide guaranteed employment and wage support, indirectly functioning as a subsidy by supplementing rural incomes. The Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) incentivizes institutional deliveries through cash assistance, improving maternal and child health outcomes.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a significant role in social welfare programs.

{"unnormalised": "The energy sector also benefits from substantial subsidies, primarily targeted at petroleum products and electricity. These subsidies aim to ensure affordable access to essential energy resources for households and industries. However, they often lead to fiscal deficits and distort market prices. The Ujjwala Yojana, launched on 01/05/2016, provides subsidized LPG connections to women from BPL households, addressing indoor air pollution and improving their health.", "normalised": "The energy sector also benefits from substantial subsidies, primarily targeted at petroleum products and electricity.

{"unnormalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs is crucial. While they can be instrumental in achieving specific goals, they also pose challenges. Fiscal prudence demands that subsidy programs be well-targeted, efficiently implemented, and regularly reviewed to ensure they are achieving their intended outcomes without creating unintended consequences. Leakage, corruption, and inefficient targeting can undermine their effectiveness. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, aimed at transferring subsidies directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, is one approach to minimize leakages and improve efficiency. Discussions around subsidy rationalization are frequent, often focusing on moving towards targeted subsidies and reducing overall expenditure. For instance, discussions during a NITI Aayog meeting on 10:00 hrs, 20/07/2023, revolved around making fertilizer subsidies more efficient and promoting the use of organic alternatives. A study by the Indian Statistical Institute suggests that better targeting could reduce subsidy expenditure by at least 15%. Furthermore, the impact on the environment needs careful consideration, as exemplified by the need to promote sustainable agricultural practices alongside fertilizer subsidies.", "normalised": "Evaluating the impact of subsidy programs is crucial.
