{"unnormalised": "Agricultural subsidies, for instance, are a cornerstone of the Indian economy, supporting farmers through subsidized fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Yojana, providing Rs. 6,000 per year to small and marginal farmers, is a prime example. These subsidies aim to ensure food security and alleviate agrarian distress, acknowledging the vulnerability of farmers to fluctuating market prices and unpredictable weather patterns. However, concerns persist regarding their efficacy in reaching the intended beneficiaries and their potential distortionary effects on market dynamics. Critics often point to the need for reforms that promote sustainable agricultural practices and reduce reliance on input-based subsidies.", "normalised": "agricultural subsidies, for instance, are a cornerstone of the indian economy, supporting farmers through subsidized fertilizers, electricity, and irrigation. the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi (P M K I S A N) yojana, providing rupees six thousand per year to small and marginal farmers, is a prime example. these subsidies aim to ensure food security and alleviate agrarian distress, acknowledging the vulnerability of farmers to fluctuating market prices and unpredictable weather patterns. however, concerns persist regarding their efficacy in reaching the intended beneficiaries and their potential distortionary effects on market dynamics. critics often point to the need for reforms that promote sustainable agricultural practices and reduce reliance on input-based subsidies."}
{"unnormalised": "Energy subsidies, particularly for LPG and kerosene, have historically been crucial for ensuring access to affordable fuel for lower-income households. While these subsidies aim to improve the living standards of vulnerable populations, they can also lead to environmental degradation and fiscal burden. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which provides subsidized LPG connections to women from BPL households, attempt to address these challenges by promoting cleaner energy alternatives.", "normalised": "energy subsidies, particularly for L P G and kerosene, have historically been crucial for ensuring access to affordable fuel for lower-income households. while these subsidies aim to improve the living standards of vulnerable populations, they can also lead to environmental degradation and fiscal burden. initiatives like the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana, which provides subsidized L P G connections to women from B P L households, attempt to address these challenges by promoting cleaner energy alternatives."}
{"unnormalised": "Educational subsidies, ranging from scholarships to subsidized tuition fees, are crucial for promoting access to education and fostering social mobility. The Right to Education Act (RTE) mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14, requiring significant public expenditure. Institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) offer subsidized education to meritorious students, contributing to the development of skilled human capital.", "normalised": "educational subsidies, ranging from scholarships to subsidized tuition fees, are crucial for promoting access to education and fostering social mobility. the right to education act (R T E) mandates free and compulsory education for children aged six to fourteen, requiring significant public expenditure. institutions like the indian institutes of technology (I I T s) and the all india institute of medical sciences (A I I M S) offer subsidized education to meritorious students, contributing to the development of skilled human capital."}
{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on efficient targeting, transparent implementation, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation. Leakage and diversion of funds remain significant challenges. Reforms aimed at Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) seek to enhance transparency and ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries directly, bypassing intermediaries. This approach is highlighted as a key strategy in the annual Economic Survey published by the Ministry of Finance.", "normalised": "the effectiveness of subsidy programs hinges on efficient targeting, transparent implementation, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation. leakage and diversion of funds remain significant challenges. reforms aimed at direct benefit transfer (D B T) seek to enhance transparency and ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries directly, bypassing intermediaries. this approach is highlighted as a key strategy in the annual economic survey published by the ministry of finance."}
