{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent areas of subsidy implementation in India is the agricultural sector. Subsidies on fertilizers, irrigation, and electricity are intended to alleviate the burden on farmers, particularly small and marginal landholders like those in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, thereby ensuring food security and boosting agricultural output. The effectiveness of these subsidies, however, is often debated, with concerns raised regarding their impact on soil health due to overuse of subsidized fertilizers and the potential for environmental degradation linked to subsidized electricity for irrigation. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, providing direct income support to farmers, represents a more targeted approach compared to blanket input subsidies.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent areas of subsidy implementation in India is the agricultural sector.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a crucial role in the energy sector. The provision of subsidized LPG cylinders under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana aims to improve access to clean cooking fuel, reducing indoor air pollution and its associated health impacts, particularly for women in rural areas. Similarly, subsidies for renewable energy projects, such as solar power installations, are intended to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, aligning with India's commitments to international climate agreements.", "normalised": "Beyond agriculture, subsidies play a crucial role in the energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of subsidy programs is not without its challenges. Leakage and inefficient targeting are persistent concerns, with benefits often failing to reach the intended beneficiaries. The Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized food grains, has historically faced issues of corruption and diversion, necessitating reforms to improve transparency and accountability.", "normalised": "The implementation of subsidy programs is not without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the fiscal burden of subsidies on the government exchequer is substantial. Balancing the need for targeted support with the imperative of fiscal prudence is a constant challenge for policymakers. The Economic Survey, often presented by the Ministry of Finance before the Union Budget, regularly highlights the need for subsidy rationalization and better targeting mechanisms.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the fiscal burden of subsidies on the government exchequer is substantial.

{"unnormalised": "Institutions like the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) play a key role in evaluating the effectiveness of subsidy programs and recommending reforms. Their analysis often considers the long-term sustainability and impact of these initiatives. The 2009 Bollywood film \"3 Idiots,\" though fictional, subtly touches on the societal pressures and the skewed incentives that can arise from heavily subsidized education, sparking conversations around the need for a more holistic and needs-based approach. In conclusion, while subsidy programs are crucial tools for achieving socio-economic goals in India, their effectiveness hinges on efficient implementation, targeted delivery, and continuous evaluation to ensure they contribute to sustainable and equitable development.", "normalised": "Institutions like the National Institution for Transforming India (N I T I Aayog) play a key role in evaluating the effectiveness of subsidy programs and recommending reforms.
