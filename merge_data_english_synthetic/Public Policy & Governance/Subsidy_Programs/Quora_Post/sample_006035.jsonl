{"unnormalised": "The efficacy of such programs hinges on several factors. Leakage and corruption can significantly erode the intended benefits. Furthermore, poorly targeted subsidies can lead to distortions in the market and unintended consequences. A classic example is the electricity subsidy for agriculture, which can incentivize excessive groundwater extraction leading to environmental degradation.", "normalised": "The efficacy of such programs hinges on several factors.
