{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs in India are diverse, ranging from agricultural subsidies benefiting farmers in Punjab to fuel subsidies aimed at mitigating the impact of fluctuating global oil prices on the common man. Examples include the PM-KISAN scheme providing Rs. 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers and subsidies on LPG cylinders to reduce the burden on households.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India are diverse, ranging from agricultural subsidies benefiting farmers in Punjab to fuel subsidies aimed at mitigating the impact of fluctuating global oil prices on the common man.

{"unnormalised": "One primary argument in favour of subsidies is their potential to alleviate poverty and promote inclusive growth. For instance, food subsidies ensure access to essential commodities for low-income families in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, interest rate subsidies on education loans facilitate access to higher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.", "normalised": "One primary argument in favour of subsidies is their potential to alleviate poverty and promote inclusive growth.

{"unnormalised": "However, critics raise concerns about the fiscal burden of these programs. The sheer scale of subsidies, sometimes amounting to several percentage points of the GDP, can strain government finances and divert resources from other critical sectors like healthcare and infrastructure development. Ineffective targeting also leads to leakages, where benefits accrue to unintended recipients. Furthermore, subsidies can distort market prices, leading to inefficiencies and hindering the competitiveness of industries. For example, excessive subsidies on fertilizers can lead to overuse and environmental damage.", "normalised": "However, critics raise concerns about the fiscal burden of these programs.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma, at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, has conducted extensive research on the impact of subsidies on agricultural productivity. His findings suggest that while subsidies can boost short-term yields, they often come at the cost of long-term sustainability.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, has conducted extensive research on the impact of subsidies on agricultural productivity.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, it's crucial to adopt a more nuanced approach to subsidy programs. This involves improving targeting mechanisms, reducing leakages, and promoting transparency. Furthermore, a gradual shift towards direct benefit transfer (DBT) can enhance efficiency and reduce corruption. We need robust evaluation frameworks to assess the impact of subsidies on various sectors and ensure that they are achieving their intended objectives, without creating unintended consequences such as land being misused, built upon with residences of 1200 sq ft, and impacting rural landscapes. A balanced approach is vital to harness the benefits of subsidies while mitigating their drawbacks.", "normalised": "Moving forward, it's crucial to adopt a more nuanced approach to subsidy programs.
