{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs in India encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from agricultural subsidies provided to farmers (e.g., fertilizer subsidies, loan waivers) to subsidies aimed at promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles. The effectiveness of these programs is often debated, with proponents highlighting their role in poverty reduction and economic growth, while critics point to inefficiencies, leakages, and potential for market distortions.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from agricultural subsidies provided to farmers (for example, fertilizer subsidies, loan waivers) to subsidies aimed at promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Such programs often offer subsidies per sq ft of construction or land purchase to beneficiaries.

{"unnormalised": "A critical aspect of any subsidy program is its fiscal sustainability. Dr. Arvind Subramanian, for instance, has often commented on the implications of unchecked subsidy expenditures on the national budget. Moreover, the targeting mechanism needs to be robust to prevent unintended beneficiaries from availing of the benefits. For example, a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme to farmers in Punjab needs to be implemented with vigilance to minimize corruption and ensure fair distribution.", "normalised": "A critical aspect of any subsidy program is its fiscal sustainability.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of subsidy programs can also be observed in sectors like education and healthcare, where subsidized fees and services are provided to vulnerable sections of society. The long-term socio-economic consequences require meticulous analysis and constant adaptation to optimize outcomes. The total subsidy bill in Rs. Crores should be compared against metrics such as poverty reduction and improved health outcomes, over a period of 5 years or more.", "normalised": "The impact of subsidy programs can also be observed in sectors like education and healthcare, where subsidized fees and services are provided to vulnerable sections of society.
