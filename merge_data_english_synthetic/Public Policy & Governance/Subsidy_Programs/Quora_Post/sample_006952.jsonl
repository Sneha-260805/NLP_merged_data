{"unnormalised": "In India, a prominent example is the food subsidy program under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), where heavily subsidized grains (rice, wheat) are provided to a large section of the population, ensuring food security. Think Rs. 2/kg for wheat and Rs. 3/kg for rice. This has a significant impact on governance by requiring efficient procurement, storage, and distribution mechanisms – a complex logistical challenge involving FCI (Food Corporation of India) and state governments.", "normalised": "In India, a prominent example is the food subsidy program under the National Food Security Act (N F S A), where heavily subsidized grains (rice, wheat) are provided to a large section of the population, ensuring food security.

{"unnormalised": "These programs, while beneficial in many ways, require careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure effectiveness and prevent leakages. They also raise questions about fiscal sustainability and their long-term impact on market efficiency. Moreover, the implementation often differs across states like Uttar Pradesh or Tamil Nadu, adding another layer of complexity. They are debated extensively by institutions like NITI Aayog and feature prominently in budget discussions.", "normalised": "These programs, while beneficial in many ways, require careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure effectiveness and prevent leakages.
