While they can provide immediate relief and stimulate economic activity, they also pose challenges such as fiscal burden, market distortions, and potential for corruption.

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), for example, aims to provide affordable housing (300-600 sq ft) with subsidies, but its success hinges on effective implementation and preventing fraudulent claims.", "normalised": "A comprehensive analysis requires considering factors like targeting efficiency – ensuring benefits reach the intended beneficiaries, minimizing leakages, and transparent implementation.

Therefore, a gradual transition towards targeted support and market-oriented reforms is crucial. Dr. R.K. Sharma's research at the Indian Institute of Public Administration highlights the need for regular evaluation and data-driven adjustments to optimize subsidy programs. We must strive for programs that are not just popular, but genuinely effective in achieving their intended outcomes without crippling the exchequer (Rs. 5,000 crore annually is a significant sum). Ultimately, effective public policy demands a balanced approach, leveraging subsidies strategically while fostering long-term economic growth and self-sufficiency. The distance from Delhi to Chennai (2200 km) is a long one; it's important that these programs effectively serve the nation end-to-end.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the long-term sustainability of subsidy programs is paramount.
