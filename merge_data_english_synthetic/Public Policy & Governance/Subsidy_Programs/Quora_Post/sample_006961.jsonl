This ensures that essential food grains like rice and wheat are available at subsidized prices to low-income families, addressing hunger and improving nutritional outcomes.

While they can alleviate poverty, boost specific sectors, and ensure access to essential goods, they can also strain the government budget, lead to market distortions, and create inefficiencies. The effective targeting and implementation of subsidy programs are crucial for maximizing their benefits and minimizing their drawbacks. Think about the impact on the celebration of Onam, if families struggle for basic food, how will they afford the Sadya?
