Subsidies can improve living standards, boost certain industries (like agriculture), and address income inequality. However, they can also strain the government budget. The Ministry of Finance continuously evaluates the rupee three lakh crore plus subsidy bill to optimize its impact. They also can lead to market distortions and inefficiencies, as firms may become overly reliant on government support. Institutions like the N I T I Aayog often suggest reforms to improve the targeting and effectiveness of these programs. Efficient allocation of resources, as opposed to blanket subsidies, is now a key consideration."}
