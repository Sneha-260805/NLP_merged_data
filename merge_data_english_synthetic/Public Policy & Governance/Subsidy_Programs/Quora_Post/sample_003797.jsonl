{"unnormalised": "Subsidies are a significant component of India's public policy landscape, impacting various sectors from agriculture to energy. While intended to promote welfare and growth, they present both challenges and opportunities.", "normalised": "One key challenge is the leakage and inefficiency in implementation. Subsidies meant for farmers, like fertilizer subsidies, often do not reach the intended beneficiaries or are diverted. This results in suboptimal resource allocation and contributes to fiscal deficits. The complex bureaucratic processes, particularly in rural areas like Bihar, often impede effective distribution. For example, the P D S (Public Distribution System) has faced criticism for corruption."}

Rationalizing subsidy schemes, focusing on targeted beneficiaries, and promoting market-based mechanisms can enhance efficiency. The success of initiatives like P M K I S A N, which directly transfers rupees six thousand per year to farmers, hinges on continuous monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, subsidies for affordable housing, especially for houses of approximately six hundred square feet in urban slums, can significantly improve living standards."}
