While they undeniably provide critical support to vulnerable populations and boost key sectors like agriculture, there are concerns about leakages, inefficiencies, and their fiscal burden on the exchequer.

Many feel we still have a long way to go before these schemes reach their full potential in India. Perhaps a bit of Onam 'sadya' (feast) for everyone to celebrate true progress!", "normalised": "The effectiveness of these subsidies is a hotly debated topic.
