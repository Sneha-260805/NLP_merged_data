Simply put, a subsidy is a financial aid provided by the government to individuals, businesses, or other entities to lower costs and encourage production or consumption of specific goods or services.

It could be to boost agricultural production (like providing subsidized fertilizer to farmers in Punjab), encourage renewable energy adoption (solar panels, for example), or make essential services like healthcare more affordable.", "normalised": "Why do governments offer subsidies?

{"unnormalised": "In India, we see numerous subsidy programs. The Public Distribution System (PDS) providing subsidized food grains through ration shops is a prime example, ensuring food security for millions. Another important area is agricultural subsidies; helping farmers with irrigation pumpsets. Sometimes these are direct cash transfers (DBT) like PM-KISAN, while others are in-kind, like supplying subsidized seeds.", "normalised": "In India, we see numerous subsidy programs.

Issues like leakages (where benefits don't reach the intended beneficiaries), market distortions (artificially low prices affecting market dynamics), and financial burden on the exchequer are common criticisms.
