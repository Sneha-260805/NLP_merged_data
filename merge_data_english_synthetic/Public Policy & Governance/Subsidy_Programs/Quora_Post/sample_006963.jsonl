In India, they play a huge role in everything from agriculture to energy.", "normalised": "Pros: Subsidies can definitely alleviate poverty. Think about the food subsidies under the National Food Security Act. They ensure access to affordable rice and wheat (rupees two per kilogram and rupees three per kilogram respectively) for millions. They can also boost specific sectors. Agricultural subsidies, while controversial, help farmers buy fertilizers and irrigation equipment, increasing yields. Plus, subsidies on renewable energy promote environmentally friendly alternatives."}

There's also the problem of leakage and inefficiency. Subsidized kerosene, intended for the poor, often gets diverted to the black market. Corruption is another major concern. Targeted delivery is crucial – ensuring the right people benefit, which is often a challenge. Finally, some argue that subsidies distort the market, making businesses dependent rather than competitive."}

Programs like M G N R E G A (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), while not strictly subsidies, provide guaranteed employment which indirectly subsidizes rural livelihoods.

Regular evaluation and reforms are key to maximizing the positive impact of subsidy programs."}
