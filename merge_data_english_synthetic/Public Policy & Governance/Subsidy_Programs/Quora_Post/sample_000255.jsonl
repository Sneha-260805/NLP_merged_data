{"unnormalised": "Firstly, *targeting efficiency* is crucial. Are subsidies reaching the intended beneficiaries, like small farmers in Vidarbha struggling with drought or MSMEs in Chennai aiming to expand their operations? Leakage and diversion are major concerns. Data analysis using schemes like Aadhaar can help minimize these.", "normalised": "Firstly, *targeting efficiency* is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, *impact assessment* is essential. Has the subsidy genuinely improved the lives of beneficiaries? For example, consider the impact of fertilizer subsidies on agricultural yields in Punjab. Are we seeing sustainable increases, or are there unintended environmental costs like soil degradation?", "normalised": "Secondly, *impact assessment* is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, *cost-benefit analysis* must be conducted. Are the benefits of the subsidy (e.g., increased agricultural output, job creation, poverty reduction) worth the cost to the exchequer? A scheme that costs Rs. 10,000 crore annually but only provides marginal benefits to a small segment of the population needs re-evaluation.", "normalised": "Thirdly, *cost-benefit analysis* must be conducted.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, consider the *potential for market distortion*. Do subsidies create unfair advantages that stifle competition? For instance, electricity subsidies to specific industries in Maharashtra might put smaller, unsubsidized businesses at a disadvantage.", "normalised": "Fourthly, consider the *potential for market distortion*.

{"unnormalised": "Sixth, think about the exit strategy. Dr. Patel at the NITI Aayog has often emphasized that subsidies shouldn't be permanent. There needs to be a plan for phasing them out as beneficiaries become self-sufficient. For example, a housing subsidy scheme providing 500 sq ft homes shouldn't become a perpetual entitlement.", "normalised": "Sixth, think about the exit strategy.
