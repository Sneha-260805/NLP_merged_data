They represent a complex trade-off between promoting welfare and economic efficiency.", "normalised": "On the pro side, subsidies like the P M Kisan Samman Nidhi provide direct financial assistance to farmers, boosting their income and enabling investment in better agricultural practices. Subsidized food through the Public Distribution System (P D S) ensures food security for vulnerable populations, particularly in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Energy subsidies, while controversial, can make electricity more affordable, especially in rural areas where access is limited. Furthermore, incentives for industries, say in Himachal Pradesh, can encourage economic activity in backward regions, creating jobs and opportunities."}

They can create market distortions, leading to inefficient resource allocation. For instance, heavily subsidized fertilizers can lead to overuse, damaging soil health. The fiscal burden of subsidies can be substantial, diverting resources from essential public services like education and healthcare. Corruption and leakages in distribution are also prevalent, as highlighted in numerous C A G reports."}

Ultimately, balancing the benefits of social welfare with the need for fiscal prudence remains a key challenge for policymakers in India. Doctor Sharma's research at I I M Bangalore sheds further light on this. Consider the implications of a rupee fifty thousand subsidy for a house of five hundred square feet – is it reaching the intended beneficiary and truly improving their quality of life?"}
