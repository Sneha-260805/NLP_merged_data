Dr. Amartya Sen's work highlights the importance of evaluating subsidy programs not just on their stated objectives, but also on their distributional impact and unintended consequences. A robust evaluation framework, encompassing parameters like cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment, is crucial for informed policy decisions. Addressing these challenges is paramount for ensuring that subsidy programs effectively contribute to inclusive growth and sustainable development in Bharat. These programs, while vital, need constant reform and re-evaluation.", "normalised": "Further, subsidies on housing, like those offered under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (P M A Y) which provides assistance for constructing houses up to a certain size (say six hundred square feet), while commendable in intent, need careful monitoring to prevent misuse and ensure quality construction.
