{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs in India represent a significant instrument of public policy, impacting diverse sectors from agriculture to energy. Their primary goal is to promote specific economic or social objectives by reducing costs for targeted beneficiaries. A prime example is the subsidy on fertilizers, aiming to enhance agricultural productivity, particularly benefitting marginal farmers in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs in India represent a significant instrument of public policy, impacting diverse sectors from agriculture to energy.

{"unnormalised": "However, the effectiveness and governance of these programs are often debated. Leakage and corruption are major concerns. Reports suggest that a significant portion of subsidized goods doesn't reach the intended beneficiaries, ending up in the hands of unscrupulous individuals. The PDS (Public Distribution System), intended to provide subsidized food grains, faces similar challenges.", "normalised": "However, the effectiveness and governance of these programs are often debated.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, subsidy programs can create market distortions. For instance, heavily subsidized electricity tariffs in some states, like Punjab, can discourage energy conservation and burden the state exchequer. The fiscal implications are substantial. The cumulative subsidy burden can strain government resources, impacting investments in other crucial areas like infrastructure development (roads, hospitals, schools covering say, 5000 sq ft).", "normalised": "Furthermore, subsidy programs can create market distortions.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Amartya Sen, among other economists, has written extensively on the need for targeted and efficient subsidy schemes. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is a move in the right direction, aiming to reduce leakages by directly transferring subsidies (e.g., Rs. 2000 annually) to beneficiaries' bank accounts. However, challenges related to digital literacy and financial inclusion persist, particularly in rural areas. Strengthening monitoring mechanisms and ensuring robust accountability are crucial for optimizing the impact of these programs. We must also consider the long-term sustainability and unintended consequences of these policies.", "normalised": "Doctor Amartya Sen, among other economists, has written extensively on the need for targeted and efficient subsidy schemes.
