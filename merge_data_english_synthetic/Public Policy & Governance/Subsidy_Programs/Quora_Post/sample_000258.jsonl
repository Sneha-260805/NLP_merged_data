{"unnormalised": "One notable example is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). While often critiqued, MGNREGA provides a crucial safety net for rural households, guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment, primarily focused on asset creation like digging ponds (around 10,000 sq ft in size) and constructing rural roads. Dr. Amartya Sen has highlighted its poverty alleviation potential.", "normalised": "One notable example is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (M G N R E G A).

{"unnormalised": "Another key area is agricultural subsidies. Subsidized fertilizers, for instance, are intended to boost crop yields for farmers in regions like Punjab and Haryana. However, overuse has led to environmental degradation and soil imbalances. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes are attempting to mitigate this by directly transferring subsidy amounts (e.g., Rs. 6000 per year) to farmers' accounts.", "normalised": "Another key area is agricultural subsidies.

{"unnormalised": "The success of these programs hinges on transparency, efficient targeting, and robust monitoring mechanisms. Corruption, leakage, and unintended distortions remain significant challenges. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation framework is crucial to assess the long-term impact and adapt the program to evolving needs. For example, examining the impact of cooking gas (LPG) subsidies provided under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana on indoor air pollution in Bihar is essential. Ethical considerations should guide the design to prevent elite capture and ensure equitable access for all deserving beneficiaries, particularly the most vulnerable sections of society.", "normalised": "The success of these programs hinges on transparency, efficient targeting, and robust monitoring mechanisms.
