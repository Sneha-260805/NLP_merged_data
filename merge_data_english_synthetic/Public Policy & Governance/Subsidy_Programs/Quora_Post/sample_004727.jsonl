{"unnormalised": "Subsidies are essentially government financial assistance to support specific industries, groups, or activities. They aim to lower costs, increase production, or promote specific social or economic goals.

{"unnormalised": "One common type is **agricultural subsidies**, like those for fertilizers and electricity for irrigation. While they help farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana increase yields and provide affordable food, they can also lead to over-reliance on specific crops (think rice and wheat), overuse of resources like groundwater, and environmental damage. The recent farmer protests highlighted complex issues surrounding these subsidies.", "normalised": "One common type is **agricultural subsidies**, like those for fertilizers and electricity for irrigation.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are **fuel subsidies**, aimed at making petrol and diesel more affordable. These benefit consumers, especially those who rely on private transport. However, they also create a significant burden on the exchequer, lead to higher consumption, and contribute to pollution.

Subsidized fees at institutions like IITs and IIMs, and programs like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, increase access to education for underprivileged students, improving social mobility.

{"unnormalised": "**Food subsidies**, channeled through the Public Distribution System (PDS), are crucial for food security, especially for lower-income families. Imagine celebrating Onam with a subsidized Onasadya! However, leakage and corruption are persistent challenges. Ultimately, subsidy programs are a double-edged sword, requiring careful design and monitoring to maximize their benefits and minimize unintended consequences for Bharat. Rs. 10,000 Crore was allocated in the last budget for this scheme.", "normalised": "**Food subsidies**, channeled through the Public Distribution System (P D S), are crucial for food security, especially for lower-income families.
