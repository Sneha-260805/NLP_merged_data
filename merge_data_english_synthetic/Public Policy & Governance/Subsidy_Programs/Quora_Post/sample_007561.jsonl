{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are essentially government assistance given to specific sectors, industries, or individuals. Think of it as a financial helping hand designed to lower the cost of essential goods and services, thereby making them more accessible. In India, these programs play a crucial role in addressing socio-economic disparities and promoting equitable growth.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are essentially government assistance given to specific sectors, industries, or individuals.

{"unnormalised": "We see subsidies across various sectors. For instance, fertilizer subsidies help farmers, especially marginal farmers in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, afford inputs for agriculture. Similarly, food subsidies, distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS), ensure that low-income families can access essential food grains at affordable prices. Consider the impact of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) - while not strictly a subsidy, it provides guaranteed employment, functioning as a wage subsidy for rural households.", "normalised": "We see subsidies across various sectors.

Just like the fictional story of corruption in \"Gangaajal,\" sometimes the benefits don't reach the intended beneficiaries. Institutions like the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) continuously analyze the effectiveness and impact of these programs to suggest improvements. Ultimately, striking a balance between providing necessary support and ensuring fiscal sustainability is key. These programs affect millions, from the small farmer in a village in Rajasthan to the urban poor in Mumbai.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs also come with their own challenges.
