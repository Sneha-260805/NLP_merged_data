Ambiguity can lead to leakage and inequitable distribution.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect is ensuring transparency and accountability in the disbursement process. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (P M K I S A N) need robust monitoring mechanisms to prevent fraudulent claims. Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T) has been a step in the right direction, reducing corruption by directly transferring funds (rupees) into beneficiaries' accounts."}

A one-time subsidy of rupees five thousand might be insufficient for a farmer struggling with debt, while indefinite support can disincentivize self-reliance. We must also consider environmental impact, especially with subsidies related to irrigation in water-stressed regions like Punjab."}

Are they achieving their intended objectives? Are there unintended consequences, such as market distortions or rent-seeking behavior? Impact assessments, ideally conducted by independent institutions like T E R I, are necessary. For instance, a housing subsidy program aiming to provide five hundred square feet homes in Mumbai should be evaluated based on its impact on affordability and living standards. Doctor Sharma's research highlights the importance of adaptive policy making, continually refining programs based on data and feedback."}
