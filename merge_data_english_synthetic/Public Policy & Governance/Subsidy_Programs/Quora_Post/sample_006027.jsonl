Are we reaching the intended beneficiaries in Uttar Pradesh or are there significant leakages? Aadhaar-linked schemes have shown promise in this regard, but digital literacy remains a challenge for many, particularly in rural areas."}

A too-small subsidy might not incentivize desired behavior, while a perpetual subsidy can create dependency and distort market prices.

Information dissemination through public portals and grievance redressal mechanisms are key. Consider the housing subsidy programs for the urban poor in Mumbai; making beneficiary lists and disbursement details publicly available can enhance accountability. Doctor Sharma's report highlighted the need for better subsidy management in the context of agricultural land, estimating that nearly three hundred square feet were being improperly used per farmer."}
