{"unnormalised": "One key thing to understand is the *sheer breadth* of subsidy programs. From fertilizer subsidies that help farmers like Ramlal in Bihar afford essential nutrients, to fuel subsidies aimed at keeping petrol prices manageable for the average Delhi commuter, they touch nearly every aspect of life. These can be direct cash transfers or indirect, like reduced electricity rates.", "normalised": "One key thing to understand is the *sheer breadth* of subsidy programs.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, efficiency and targeting are critical. Often, subsidies can be leaky; they might not reach the intended beneficiaries or can be exploited. The Jan Dhan Yojana and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes aim to address this by directly transferring funds to people's bank accounts. This reduces corruption and ensures benefits reach the right hands.", "normalised": "Secondly, efficiency and targeting are critical.

Like a scene from \"Swades\", sometimes a seemingly good intention can have unintended consequences if not carefully planned.
