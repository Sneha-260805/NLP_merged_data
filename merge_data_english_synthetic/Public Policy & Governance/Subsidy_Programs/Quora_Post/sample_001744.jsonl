India spends a huge amount annually on various subsidies, diverting funds from other crucial areas like healthcare and education. There's also the problem of leakage and corruption. Often, subsidized goods don't reach the intended beneficiaries, ending up in the black market or being siphoned off by corrupt officials."}

Artificially low prices discourage efficiency and innovation. For example, excessive electricity subsidies can lead to wasteful consumption and hinder the growth of renewable energy sources. Reforms suggested by institutions like N I T I Aayog often advocate for targeted subsidies and a gradual move towards market-based pricing, but political will remains a challenge. Ultimately, the key lies in designing subsidy programs that are efficient, transparent, and truly benefit those who need them most."}
