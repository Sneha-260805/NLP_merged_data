Subsidized fertilizers and irrigation water help farmers, particularly those with small landholdings, less than two acres, increase yields and income, directly impacting rural livelihoods. Similarly, energy subsidies, like those for L P G cylinders under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, improve access to cleaner cooking fuels, especially for women in rural areas."}

Large-scale subsidies strain the national exchequer; the food subsidy alone accounts for a substantial portion of the annual budget, exceeding rupees two lakh crore in some years. Furthermore, inefficient targeting leads to leakages, where benefits accrue to unintended beneficiaries. For example, subsidized electricity meant for agriculture is often diverted to other sectors. Also, excessive subsidies can distort market signals, leading to over-exploitation of resources like groundwater in states like Punjab and Haryana, where yields of rice have increased substantially due to this subsidy."}

We must also consider long-term sustainability and explore alternative policy instruments like D B T wherever feasible to improve efficiency and reduce distortion. Subsidizing affordable housing in urban centres like Mumbai, for example, providing land at subsidized rates leading to cheaper homes per square foot, can also alleviate pressure on urban infrastructure, but requires careful planning to avoid unintended consequences."}
