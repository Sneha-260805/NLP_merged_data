Farmers across states like Punjab and Haryana benefit from subsidized fertilizer, electricity, and irrigation. The impact is mixed. While these subsidies have boosted food production, particularly in the Green Revolution, they have also led to over-reliance on groundwater and soil degradation. Furthermore, the Minimum Support Price (M S P) is a crucial subsidy, guaranteeing a procurement price for select crops."}
