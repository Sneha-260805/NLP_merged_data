{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are essentially government interventions designed to support specific sectors or individuals, making certain goods or services more affordable. Think of them as a form of financial assistance, often in the form of tax breaks, cash payments, or price support.

{"unnormalised": "Why does the government offer subsidies? Well, they aim to achieve various objectives. For instance, the subsidy on fertilizers helps farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana afford essential inputs, boosting agricultural production and potentially addressing food security. Similarly, subsidized cooking gas (LPG) through programs like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana aims to provide cleaner fuel to households, reducing indoor air pollution, particularly affecting women in rural areas.", "normalised": "Why does the government offer subsidies?

Plus, they can sometimes lead to inefficiencies or distortions in the market. Think of how heavily subsidized food grains through the Public Distribution System (PDS) affect market prices for farmers who don't benefit from it.", "normalised": "However, subsidies are a double-edged sword.

{"unnormalised": "India has a wide range of subsidy programs, from agriculture and education to healthcare and energy. The debate around them is constant: Are they effectively reaching the intended beneficiaries? Are they sustainable in the long run? Are there better, more targeted approaches? Even the price of a plate of biryani during Ramadan, kept artificially low through subsidized ingredients in some community kitchens, reflects a conscious policy choice.", "normalised": "India has a wide range of subsidy programs, from agriculture and education to healthcare and energy.

{"unnormalised": "The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme is an attempt to improve efficiency and reduce leakages by directly transferring subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts, like in the case of scholarships for students in IIT Madras or financial assistance for families in Kerala during Onam. Understanding subsidy programs is crucial for anyone interested in Indian public policy and governance. They are a complex and contested tool with far-reaching consequences.", "normalised": "The Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T) scheme is an attempt to improve efficiency and reduce leakages by directly transferring subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts, like in the case of scholarships for students in I I T Madras or financial assistance for families in Kerala during Onam.
