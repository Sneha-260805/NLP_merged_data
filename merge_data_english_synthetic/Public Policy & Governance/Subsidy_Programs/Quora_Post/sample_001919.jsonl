For example, the L P G subsidy under the Ujjwala Yojana has aimed to provide cleaner cooking fuel to millions of households in rural India, reducing indoor air pollution and improving health outcomes. They can also foster innovation in specific sectors."}

They can be expensive for the exchequer, potentially diverting funds from other crucial areas like education or healthcare. Consider the power subsidy given to agricultural consumers; while intended to help farmers, it can lead to the over-extraction of groundwater, a major environmental challenge in states like Punjab and Haryana. There's also the risk of corruption and leakages."}

While some subsidies, like those for school lunches, demonstrably improve nutrition and school attendance, others are less impactful. The effectiveness depends on the design and implementation of the program. Rigorous evaluation, like those conducted by institutions like the National Institution for Transforming India (N I T I Aayog), is crucial. Remember the movie \"Peepli Live\"? It touched upon the issues faced by farmers and the complexities of subsidy dependence."}
