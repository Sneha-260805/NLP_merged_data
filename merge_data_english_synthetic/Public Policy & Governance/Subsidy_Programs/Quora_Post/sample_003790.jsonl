For example, the Public Distribution System (PDS) provides subsidized food grains to millions of families below the poverty line, aiming to ensure food security. Similarly, fertilizer subsidies assist farmers, lowering their production costs and theoretically boosting agricultural output. However, the efficacy of these subsidies is frequently debated.", "normalised": "A key objective is often to support vulnerable populations.

{"unnormalised": "Critiques often point to inefficiencies, leakages, and distortions in the market. Dr. Sharma, a prominent economist at the IIM Ahmedabad, has argued that poorly designed subsidy programs can create unintended consequences, such as over-reliance on certain inputs or the crowding out of private investment. The allocation of subsidies for housing, say for construction of homes under 500 sq ft in Mumbai, can sometimes lead to suboptimal land use and construction quality.", "normalised": "Critiques often point to inefficiencies, leakages, and distortions in the market. Doctor Sharma, a prominent economist at the I I M Ahmedabad, has argued that poorly designed subsidy programs can create unintended consequences, such as over-reliance on certain inputs or the crowding out of private investment.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the fiscal burden of subsidies is considerable. The Indian government spends a substantial portion of its budget on these programs; for example, Rs. 20,000 crore allocated in 2022 for a particular agricultural subsidy scheme. It is crucial to assess whether these expenditures are yielding the desired outcomes and whether alternative policy instruments might be more effective in achieving the same objectives. Careful monitoring, rigorous evaluation, and transparent implementation are essential to ensure that subsidy programs serve their intended purpose and contribute to sustainable and inclusive development in India. Continuous reforms are needed to reduce distortions and optimize benefits.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the fiscal burden of subsidies is considerable.
