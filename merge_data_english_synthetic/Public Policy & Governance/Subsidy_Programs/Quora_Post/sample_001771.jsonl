Essentially, they are government financial assistance provided to individuals, businesses, or other institutions to promote certain activities or outcomes.

{"unnormalised": "One major benefit is poverty alleviation. Subsidized food grains through the Public Distribution System (PDS) help ensure food security for vulnerable populations. They can also stimulate economic growth in specific sectors, like incentivizing renewable energy production with subsidies on solar panels, thereby reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Agricultural subsidies, although controversial, are meant to support farmers facing unpredictable monsoon seasons and fluctuating market prices.", "normalised": "One major benefit is poverty alleviation.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidies have drawbacks. They can be a drain on the government exchequer, potentially diverting funds from other essential sectors like healthcare and education. Inefficient targeting can lead to leakages, where benefits don't reach the intended beneficiaries. For instance, a 2015 study by IFPRI estimated significant leakages in the PDS system. Furthermore, they can distort market prices, creating inefficiencies and potentially harming competition. Remember the film \"Peepli Live\"? It, albeit satirically, highlighted the complexities and sometimes absurdities of agricultural subsidies in India. Proper monitoring and evaluation, like that conducted by NITI Aayog, are crucial to ensure that subsidy programs achieve their intended goals without unintended consequences. The Rs. 2 lakh crore subsidy bill is a significant burden and needs careful management.", "normalised": "However, subsidies have drawbacks.
