{"unnormalised": "**Answer:**", "normalised": "Evaluating the effectiveness of subsidy programs in India requires a multifaceted approach, considering both economic and social impacts. Firstly, the target efficiency is paramount: does the subsidy actually reach the intended beneficiaries, such as small farmers in Bihar or artisans in Kutch? Leakage and diversion are significant concerns."}
{"unnormalised": "Evaluating the effectiveness of subsidy programs in India requires a multifaceted approach, considering both economic and social impacts. Firstly, the *target efficiency* is paramount: does the subsidy actually reach the intended beneficiaries, such as small farmers in Bihar or artisans in Kutch? Leakage and diversion are significant concerns.", "normalised": "Secondly, the cost-benefit ratio needs scrutiny. Are the economic benefits, like increased agricultural output or enhanced skill development, worth the financial outlay, often funded by taxpayer rupees? For example, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana's (P M A Y) success hinges on whether the subsidies provided for affordable housing (e.g., homes under six hundred square feet) truly stimulate the construction sector and improve living standards."}

Subsidies can distort market prices, create dependency, and disincentivize innovation. For instance, heavily subsidized electricity for agriculture in Punjab might lead to over-extraction of groundwater."}
