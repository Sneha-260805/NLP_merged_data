Programs like the Public Distribution System (PDS), providing subsidized food grains, ensure food security for millions, particularly in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Subsidized fertilizers benefit farmers, increasing agricultural productivity, though often criticized for inefficient targeting and water pollution, especially in Punjab. Housing subsidies, under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, improve living standards, granting families access to affordable homes, perhaps even a 500 sq ft apartment in a metropolitan area.", "normalised": "One significant advantage is poverty alleviation.

{"unnormalised": "However, downsides abound. Subsidies can create market distortions, hindering competition and innovation. The massive power subsidies in some states encourage wasteful consumption. They also place a heavy burden on the exchequer. The fiscal deficit widens as the government spends significant amounts, sometimes running into thousands of crores (Rs.). Moreover, leakages and corruption plague many schemes, reducing their effectiveness. Dr. Sharma, former Finance Secretary, has often spoken about the need for better targeting and direct benefit transfer (DBT) to reduce such problems. DBT, directly depositing money into beneficiaries' accounts, is aimed at preventing middlemen from siphoning off funds. Finally, some subsidies disproportionately benefit wealthier sections, undermining the goal of equitable distribution. A proper evaluation of the long-term impact is critical.", "normalised": "However, downsides abound. Subsidies can create market distortions, hindering competition and innovation.
