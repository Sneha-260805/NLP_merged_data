{"unnormalised": "Several types of subsidies exist. Production subsidies, like those offered to agricultural sectors in India, such as the support price for rice in Punjab, aim to boost domestic production. Consumption subsidies, such as subsidized LPG cylinders under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, make essential goods and services more affordable for vulnerable populations. Export subsidies, though often subject to international trade regulations, encourage domestic businesses to export goods.", "normalised": "Several types of subsidies exist.

{"unnormalised": "The implications for public policy are multifaceted. Subsidies can be effective tools for achieving social and economic goals, such as poverty reduction, food security, and environmental protection. For example, the subsidy on fertilizer for farmers in Uttar Pradesh aims to enhance agricultural output. However, they can also be costly, distort markets, and create inefficiencies. Leakage, corruption, and unintended consequences, like the over-reliance on heavily subsidized fertilizers leading to soil degradation, are common concerns. A proper evaluation framework, encompassing cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment, is crucial for effective implementation. Dr. R.K. Sharma's research at IIM Ahmedabad highlights the complexities of subsidy programs in the Indian context. Furthermore, the design must be carefully considered; a subsidy of Rs. 5000 per sq ft for affordable housing may not achieve its intended goal if land prices in Mumbai remain exorbitantly high.", "normalised": "The implications for public policy are multifaceted.
