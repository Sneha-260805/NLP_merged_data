While it's had its share of criticism regarding overuse and environmental impact, it did play a significant role in the Green Revolution, dramatically increasing food production in the nineteen seventies and eighties. The success was partially due to the urgency of food security at the time."}

If the goal is to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles for reducing emissions, for example, then the incentives should be accessible to the targeted demographic and not plagued by bureaucratic delays reminiscent of a frustrating scene from a classic like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. Transparency and accountability are key, along with a mechanism to adjust the subsidy based on market conditions and emerging technologies."}
