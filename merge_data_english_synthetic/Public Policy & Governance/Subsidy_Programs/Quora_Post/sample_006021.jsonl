For example, assessing the impact of an electricity subsidy on agricultural productivity in Punjab or the impact of rupee fifty thousand subsidy on purchasing a one thousand square foot flat in Mumbai requires robust data analysis. Furthermore, excessive reliance on subsidies can create fiscal strain and distort market forces. A balanced approach, focusing on targeted interventions and evidence-based policymaking, is essential for maximizing the positive impact of these programs. What are your thoughts on the viability of direct benefit transfers as an alternative to traditional subsidies?"}
