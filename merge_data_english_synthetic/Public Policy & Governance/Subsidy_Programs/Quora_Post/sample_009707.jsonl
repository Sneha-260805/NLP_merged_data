Think about the fertilizer subsidies that aim to boost agricultural productivity, benefiting farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana. Or the subsidies on LPG cylinders, intended to make cooking gas affordable for households across the country.

{"unnormalised": "For example, while fertilizer subsidies help increase crop yields, they can also lead to overuse, harming the environment. Similarly, food subsidies, like those offered through the Public Distribution System (PDS), ensure food security for vulnerable populations but can be prone to leakages and inefficiencies. Consider the impact on access to rice and wheat for families celebrating a festival like Onam in Kerala. The availability and affordability of ingredients for a traditional Onam Sadhya can be directly affected.", "normalised": "For example, while fertilizer subsidies help increase crop yields, they can also lead to overuse, harming the environment.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding the design and implementation of these subsidy programs is critical. Are they well-targeted? Are they creating unintended consequences? Are there alternative approaches that could achieve the desired outcomes more efficiently? These are the kind of questions policy analysts at institutions like the IIMs and TERI are constantly grappling with. A well-designed subsidy can empower, but a poorly designed one can distort the market and burden the exchequer – sometimes costing upwards of Rs. 2 lakh crore annually. This necessitates robust evaluation and adaptive policy adjustments. The goal should be to maximize benefit for the intended recipients while minimizing unintended negative consequences and fiscal strain. For instance, direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes aim to reduce corruption, channeling subsidies directly into beneficiaries' bank accounts instead of relying on intermediaries.", "normalised": "Understanding the design and implementation of these subsidy programs is critical.
