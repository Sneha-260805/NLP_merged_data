{"unnormalised": "The PDS, for instance, ensures food security for millions, especially in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, fertilizer subsidies assist farmers, particularly small landholders with less than 2 acres in Tamil Nadu, enabling them to purchase essential inputs. However, concerns exist regarding leakage, inefficiencies in distribution, and the potential for environmental damage due to overuse of subsidized fertilizers.", "normalised": "The P D S, for instance, ensures food security for millions, especially in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

{"unnormalised": "Effective subsidy program design and implementation require careful consideration of targeting mechanisms, monitoring systems, and rigorous impact assessment. Addressing issues like corruption, ensuring efficient delivery, and promoting sustainable practices are crucial for maximizing the benefits of these vital public policy tools. A study conducted by IIM Ahmedabad estimates that Rs. 50,000 crore is spent annually on food subsidies alone. This demonstrates the scale of investment, and necessitates careful management.", "normalised": "Effective subsidy program design and implementation require careful consideration of targeting mechanisms, monitoring systems, and rigorous impact assessment.
