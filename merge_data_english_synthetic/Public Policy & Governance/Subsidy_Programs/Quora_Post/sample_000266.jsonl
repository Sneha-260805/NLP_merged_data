Similarly, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides wage subsidies for rural employment, aiming to alleviate poverty and improve rural livelihoods. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) also provides interest subsidies for affordable housing, helping families like the Khannas in Mumbai own a home with 600 sq ft area.", "normalised": "For example, the fertilizer subsidy is intended to support farmers like Mister Sharma from Haryana, enabling them to access essential inputs at reduced costs.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Patel, an economist at IIM Ahmedabad, argues that targeted subsidies are often more effective than broad-based approaches. Furthermore, integrating technology, such as direct benefit transfer (DBT), can minimize corruption and ensure that subsidies reach intended beneficiaries. The success of programs like the LPG subsidy (PAHAL) through DBT demonstrates this potential. Evaluating the long-term impact on beneficiary behaviour and unintended consequences is crucial for refining these policies and ensuring that they truly serve the nation's interests, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, across its 3.287 million sq km land area.", "normalised": "Doctor Patel, an economist at I I M Ahmedabad, argues that targeted subsidies are often more effective than broad-based approaches.
