{"unnormalised": "In India, we see subsidy programs across numerous sectors. For example, the Public Distribution System (PDS) provides subsidized food grains like rice and wheat to lower-income families through ration shops. This is crucial for food security, particularly in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Another prominent example is the fertilizer subsidy, aimed at reducing the cost burden on farmers like Mr. Sharma in Haryana, encouraging higher agricultural yields. There's also the LPG subsidy, which has helped millions of households in India, particularly women, access cleaner cooking fuel.", "normalised": "In India, we see subsidy programs across numerous sectors.

Finding the right balance between supporting crucial sectors and ensuring fiscal responsibility is a key challenge for policymakers. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure these subsidies contribute to inclusive growth and societal well-being in a sustainable manner.
