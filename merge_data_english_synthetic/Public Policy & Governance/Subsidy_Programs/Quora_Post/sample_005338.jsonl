{"unnormalised": "One relatively successful example is the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system, where subsidies are directly deposited into beneficiaries' accounts. This cuts down on leakages and ensures that the intended recipients, like farmers receiving support for fertilizers, actually get the money. Think of it as modernizing the system – much more efficient than the old ways depicted in movies like \"Mother India,\" where exploitative landlords siphoned off everything.", "normalised": "One relatively successful example is the direct benefit transfer (D B T) system, where subsidies are directly deposited into beneficiaries' accounts.

{"unnormalised": "Success factors include clear targeting criteria, robust monitoring mechanisms, and regular evaluation. The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad has conducted several studies on the impact of different subsidy schemes, highlighting the importance of adaptive design – modifying programs based on real-world feedback. For instance, subsidy programs related to LPG gas need to be constantly re-evaluated to address the needs of beneficiaries in places like Bihar vs those in Maharashtra.", "normalised": "Success factors include clear targeting criteria, robust monitoring mechanisms, and regular evaluation.
