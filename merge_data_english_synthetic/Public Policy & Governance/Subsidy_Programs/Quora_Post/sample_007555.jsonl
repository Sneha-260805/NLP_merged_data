The aim is usually to lower the cost of a particular good or service, making it more affordable and accessible to a larger section of the population.

This reduces the input cost, allowing them to sell their produce at a lower price, benefiting both farmers and consumers. Similarly, subsidized cooking gas (LPG) under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana aims to improve the lives of women in rural areas and reduce reliance on firewood.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: the government might subsidize fertilizers for farmers.

{"unnormalised": "Common examples in India include subsidies on food (through the Public Distribution System or PDS), fertilizers, electricity, and education. The effectiveness of each subsidy program depends on various factors, including efficient targeting, monitoring, and prevention of leakages. Proper implementation is key to ensuring that the benefits reach the intended beneficiaries and contribute to overall national development. For example, a farmer in Punjab receiving subsidized electricity might then be able to produce more rice. In a country as diverse as India, designing and implementing effective subsidy policies remains a constant challenge. Rs. 500 Cr. are spent on subsidies annually in some sectors.", "normalised": "Common examples in India include subsidies on food (through the Public Distribution System or P D S), fertilizers, electricity, and education.
