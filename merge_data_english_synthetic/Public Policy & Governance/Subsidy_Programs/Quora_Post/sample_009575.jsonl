There are also fuel subsidies, though these are gradually being phased out, and subsidies on LPG cylinders to make cooking fuel more accessible, especially to lower-income households. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) can even be seen as a kind of wage subsidy, guaranteeing 100 days of work.", "normalised": "Common examples include subsidies on fertilizers for farmers, helping them afford essential inputs and boosting agricultural production.

{"unnormalised": "The debate around Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is central to this. DBT aims to directly transfer subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' bank accounts, like their Jan Dhan accounts, reducing leakages and improving efficiency. For example, a farmer in Punjab receives Rs. 6000 per year under the PM-KISAN scheme directly into his account via DBT. This reduces intermediaries, corruption, and the whole process is more transparent.", "normalised": "The debate around Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T) is central to this.

Careful targeting and regular evaluation are essential to ensure they achieve their intended objectives without crippling the exchequer.
