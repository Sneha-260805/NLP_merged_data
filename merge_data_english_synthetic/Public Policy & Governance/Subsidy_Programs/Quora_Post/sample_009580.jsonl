While they can undoubtedly improve access to essential goods and services, they can also be prone to leakages, inefficiencies, and unintended consequences. For example, are the benefits of fertilizer subsidies really reaching the small farmers in Bihar, or are they mainly benefiting larger landowners?", "normalised": "The effectiveness of these programs is a complex issue.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the effectiveness of a subsidy program depends on its design, implementation, and monitoring. A well-designed program can be a powerful tool for social and economic development, but a poorly designed one can lead to waste and distortions. Analyzing the impact with data-driven insights and adapting based on performance is critical for programs like these. Maybe over a plate of delicious biryani, we could brainstorm even better strategies! Happy Onam to everyone celebrating!", "normalised": "Ultimately, the effectiveness of a subsidy program depends on its design, implementation, and monitoring.
