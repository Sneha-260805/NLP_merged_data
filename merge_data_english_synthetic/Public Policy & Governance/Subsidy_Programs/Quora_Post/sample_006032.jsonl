While some subsidies, like those targeting education, show demonstrable positive impact, others, such as power subsidies, can be distortionary.

Doctor Patel’s research suggests that rationalizing these rupee ten thousand crore subsidies would free up resources for infrastructure development, improving connectivity even to remote areas two hundred kilometer away."}
