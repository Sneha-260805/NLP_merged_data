{"unnormalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy, particularly in developing economies like India. They aim to address market failures, promote specific sectors (e.g., agriculture), or ensure access to essential goods and services for vulnerable populations. Understanding their effectiveness requires looking beyond just the budget allocated.", "normalised": "Subsidy programs are a cornerstone of public policy, particularly in developing economies like India.

{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the **target audience** is crucial. Is the subsidy reaching the intended beneficiaries? Leakages, like those often lamented in PDS (Public Distribution System) reforms, can significantly diminish the program's impact. Data driven monitoring, akin to the tools used in organizations like NITI Aayog, are important here.", "normalised": "Firstly, the target audience is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, the **economic efficiency** needs assessment. Does the subsidy create distortions in the market? For instance, highly subsidized electricity for farmers in Punjab can lead to unsustainable groundwater depletion. Thinking like a character in the movie 'Swades', we must evaluate the long-term environmental and social consequences.", "normalised": "Secondly, the economic efficiency needs assessment.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, the **cost-benefit analysis** is essential. Are the benefits of the subsidy outweighing the costs, including administrative expenses and potential unintended consequences? We need to measure the value delivered for every Rs. spent.", "normalised": "Thirdly, the cost-benefit analysis is essential. Are the benefits of the subsidy outweighing the costs, including administrative expenses and potential unintended consequences? We need to measure the value delivered for every rupee spent."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, **regular evaluation and adaptation** are vital. The socio-economic landscape changes, and subsidy programs need to evolve. A program successful in 2010 might be irrelevant or even harmful in 2023. Consider the Bharat Nirman Yojana and how it has adapted through phases.", "normalised": "Finally, regular evaluation and adaptation are vital.

{"unnormalised": "In short, evaluating subsidy programs is complex, requiring a holistic approach considering target audience, efficiency, cost-benefit analysis, and adaptive capacity. It's not just about disbursing funds; it's about achieving meaningful, sustainable outcomes for the nation.", "normalised": "In short, evaluating subsidy programs is complex, requiring a holistic approach considering target audience, efficiency, cost-benefit analysis, and adaptive capacity.
