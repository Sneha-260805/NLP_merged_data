While crucial for ensuring affordable inputs for farmers, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, it faces criticism regarding its distribution efficiency and environmental consequences due to excessive fertilizer use. Measurement of impact here involves tracking agricultural productivity versus the cost of the subsidy and its environmental footprint (e.g., groundwater contamination).", "normalised": "Another significant program is the fertilizer subsidy scheme.
