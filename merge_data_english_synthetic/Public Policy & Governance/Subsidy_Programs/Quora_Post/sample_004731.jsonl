{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. They can strain the government budget – resources that could potentially be used for infrastructure development or education, like building more schools in Bihar. They can also lead to inefficiencies, distortions in the market, and even corruption. For example, the effectiveness of the Public Distribution System (PDS) and its food subsidies is constantly debated. Is everyone who needs rice actually receiving it, or are there leakages along the way?", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.
