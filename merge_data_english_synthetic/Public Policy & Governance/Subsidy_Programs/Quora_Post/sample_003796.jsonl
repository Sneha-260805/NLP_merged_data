{"unnormalised": "Secondly, the method of disbursement matters significantly. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) has proven effective in schemes like PM-KISAN, reducing corruption compared to older, more complex systems. We must also consider in-kind subsidies versus cash transfers.", "normalised": "Secondly, the method of disbursement matters significantly.
