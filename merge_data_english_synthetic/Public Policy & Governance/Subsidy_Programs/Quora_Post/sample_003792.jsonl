This, in turn, can potentially increase agricultural productivity. Similarly, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides subsidized employment opportunities in rural areas, addressing unemployment and fostering rural development. Housing subsidies, such as those under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), aim to improve access to affordable housing, especially for the urban poor. The scheme provides subsidies up to Rs. 2.67 Lakhs, enabling families to purchase homes even in cities like Mumbai, where property prices are high (Rs. 15,000 per sq ft in some areas).", "normalised": "A crucial example is the fertilizer subsidy provided to farmers, enabling them to purchase essential inputs at reduced rates.

{"unnormalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges. Leakage, inefficient targeting, and fiscal burden are persistent concerns. Dr. Amartya Sen has often highlighted the importance of efficient distribution mechanisms to ensure that the benefits reach the intended beneficiaries. Moreover, some argue that subsidies can distort market prices and create dependency. The success of a subsidy program depends heavily on its design, implementation, and monitoring. Rigorous evaluation is essential to assess their true impact and identify areas for improvement. Further research is needed to quantify the impact of, say, a Rs. 10,000 crore allocation on rural incomes in Bihar.", "normalised": "However, subsidy programs are not without their challenges.
