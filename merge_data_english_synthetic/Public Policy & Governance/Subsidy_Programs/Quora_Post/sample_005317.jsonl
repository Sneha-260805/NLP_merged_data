Leakages and inclusion or exclusion errors can significantly undermine the program's impact. The Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T) scheme, like transferring L P G subsidies directly to bank accounts, aims to address this."}

We need robust mechanisms to track program performance, identify bottlenecks, and assess whether the intended beneficiaries are actually benefitting. Are farmers actually getting the promised amount? Is it leading to increased productivity, or are there middlemen eating into the subsidies?"}

Can the government afford to continue the subsidy program in the long run? Are there alternative approaches that might be more cost-effective? The classic Bollywood film, \"Mother India\", depicted the struggles of farmers burdened by debt, highlighting the need for sustainable solutions beyond just subsidies. For instance, focusing on irrigation infrastructure instead of just electricity subsidies for pumps could be a better long-term investment in states like Punjab. Ultimately, successful subsidy programs require a nuanced understanding of the Indian context and a commitment to evidence-based policymaking."}
