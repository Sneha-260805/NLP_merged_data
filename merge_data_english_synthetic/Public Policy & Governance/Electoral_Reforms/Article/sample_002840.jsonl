{"unnormalised": "One significant area requiring reform pertains to campaign finance. The current system allows for opacity and the potential for undue influence. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has repeatedly advocated for stricter regulations, including limiting corporate donations and enhancing transparency in political party funding. The electoral bonds scheme, despite its stated aims, has faced scrutiny for allegedly lacking transparency and potentially favouring certain parties. Moving towards a state-funded election model, albeit with careful consideration of its feasibility and implementation challenges, could level the playing field.", "normalised": "One significant area requiring reform pertains to campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial aspect concerns criminalization of politics. The presence of individuals with criminal records in legislatures undermines public trust. While the ECI has made efforts to disclose criminal antecedents of candidates, more stringent measures are needed. Expediting judicial proceedings against politicians facing criminal charges and barring convicted individuals from contesting elections for a longer period are imperative. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, needs amendments to address this effectively.", "normalised": "Another crucial aspect concerns criminalization of politics.

Ensuring accurate and updated voter lists, especially in areas with high migration rates, is essential to prevent disenfranchisement. The linking of Aadhaar with voter IDs, though debated, could potentially address the issue of multiple voter registrations. However, data privacy concerns must be addressed with utmost diligence.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral roll management needs continuous improvement.

{"unnormalised": "As India celebrates its democratic ideals, perhaps over a plate of delicious biryani during Eid or reflecting on the harvest during Onam, the need for continuous electoral reforms remains a constant imperative. These reforms are not merely procedural changes; they are fundamental to upholding the principles of justice, equality, and participatory governance enshrined in the Constitution. The ECI, along with the government, civil society organizations, and citizens, must work collaboratively to strengthen the electoral process and ensure that every vote counts.", "normalised": "As India celebrates its democratic ideals, perhaps over a plate of delicious biryani during Eid or reflecting on the harvest during Onam, the need for continuous electoral reforms remains a constant imperative.
