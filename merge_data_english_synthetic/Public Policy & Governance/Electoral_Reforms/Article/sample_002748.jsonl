{"unnormalised": "Several key areas require continuous attention and improvement. One critical aspect is campaign finance. The current system allows for opaque funding sources and excessive spending, creating an uneven playing field. Proposals to increase transparency in political donations, perhaps through mandatory disclosure of donors contributing over Rs. 20,000 and stricter enforcement of expenditure limits, are essential. The introduction of a state funding model for elections, while debated, could potentially reduce the reliance on private funding and level the playing field for smaller parties.", "normalised": "Several key areas require continuous attention and improvement.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial area is electoral roll management. Errors and inconsistencies in voter lists disenfranchise eligible voters and create opportunities for fraudulent activities. Initiatives like the Election Commission of India's (ECI) National Electoral Roll Purification and Authentication Programme (NERPAP) are vital but need continuous refinement. Linking Aadhaar to voter IDs, while controversial, aims to address the issue of multiple registrations, but concerns regarding privacy and potential for exclusion must be carefully addressed.", "normalised": "Another crucial area is electoral roll management.

{"unnormalised": "The use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of voting.

{"unnormalised": "Delays in criminal case trials against politicians also undermine the democratic process. Expediting these trials and disqualifying individuals convicted of serious crimes, as per the provisions already in place, is paramount. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, needs further strengthening to deter candidates with criminal backgrounds from contesting elections.", "normalised": "Delays in criminal case trials against politicians also undermine the democratic process.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, promoting voter awareness and participation, particularly among marginalized communities and first-time voters, is essential. The ECI's Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme plays a crucial role in this regard.

{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are a continuous process. The Justice Verma Committee recommendations on electoral reforms and the various reports submitted by the Law Commission of India provide valuable insights. Implementing these recommendations, along with ongoing dialogue and collaboration between the government, the ECI, political parties, and civil society organizations, is crucial for strengthening India's democratic foundations and ensuring a free, fair, and inclusive electoral process.
