{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the democratic process. In India, the world's largest democracy, the need for continuous improvement in the electoral system is paramount to address emerging challenges and strengthen citizen's faith in the political landscape. These reforms encompass a wide range of measures, from voter registration and campaign finance regulations to the functioning of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the use of technology in elections.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the democratic process.

{"unnormalised": "One significant area requiring reform is campaign finance. The current system allows for opaque funding, creating opportunities for undue influence by corporations and individuals. Experts like Dr. Vijay Kelkar have advocated for stricter regulations on campaign donations, increased transparency in reporting, and potentially, partial state funding of elections to level the playing field. This would reduce the reliance on black money and promote a more equitable electoral contest. The debate regarding electoral bonds and their impact on transparency continues to rage on.", "normalised": "One significant area requiring reform is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of concern is the criminalization of politics. Individuals with criminal records contesting elections poses a serious threat to the integrity of the political system. While the ECI has taken steps to address this issue, such as requiring candidates to declare their criminal antecedents, stronger measures are needed. This includes expedited trials for politicians facing criminal charges and potentially barring individuals convicted of serious offenses from contesting elections. Justice Verma Committee's recommendations on this front remain relevant.", "normalised": "Another area of concern is the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration processes also need streamlining. Millions of eligible voters are often left out due to cumbersome registration procedures. Simplifying the process, leveraging technology like Aadhaar (while addressing privacy concerns), and conducting regular voter awareness campaigns, particularly in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, are essential. The ECI’s efforts to increase voter turnout among women are commendable, with initiatives like all-women polling booths being implemented in various states.", "normalised": "Voter registration processes also need streamlining.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) has been a subject of debate. While EVMs have enhanced efficiency and reduced malpractices like booth capturing, concerns regarding their security and potential for tampering persist. Regular audits, increased voter awareness about the VVPAT system, and further research into secure and transparent voting technologies are necessary. Recent concerns raised by opposition parties necessitate a thorough review.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the use of Electronic Voting Machines (E V M s) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (V V P A T) has been a subject of debate.

{"unnormalised": "The size of constituencies also warrants attention. Disparities in constituency size can lead to unequal representation. A delimitation exercise, conducted periodically and based on equitable principles, is needed to ensure that each Member of Parliament (MP) represents a roughly equal number of voters. This exercise must be carried out without political bias to maintain fairness.", "normalised": "The size of constituencies also warrants attention.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the ECI is vital. While the ECI has a strong track record, measures to further insulate it from political interference, such as a more transparent and participatory selection process for Election Commissioners, are always welcome. The ECI often conducts elections in extremely challenging conditions, such as in Naxal-affected areas of Chhattisgarh, covering vast distances of 1000 sq km or more within a single constituency. The approximate cost of conducting a general election can be in the range of Rs. 5000-Rs. 7000 crore. Implementing these reforms can help strengthen the democratic fabric of India and build a more inclusive and representative political system for all its citizens.", "normalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the E C I is vital.

The E C I often conducts elections in extremely challenging conditions, such as in Naxal-affected areas of Chhattisgarh, covering vast distances of one thousand square kilometer or more within a single constituency. The approximate cost of conducting a general election can be in the range of rupees five thousand crore to rupees seven thousand crore. Implementing these reforms can help strengthen the democratic fabric of India and build a more inclusive and representative political system for all its citizens."}
