{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are vital for bolstering the integrity, transparency, and inclusivity of the democratic process. In a diverse nation like India, home to over 1.3 billion people, constantly refining the electoral system is paramount to ensure fair representation and public trust. Over the years, India has witnessed several amendments and judicial interventions aimed at improving the electoral landscape, yet numerous challenges persist.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are vital for bolstering the integrity, transparency, and inclusivity of the democratic process.

{"unnormalised": "One critical area of focus is campaign finance. The opacity surrounding political funding often leads to corruption and undue influence by powerful lobbies. Implementing stricter regulations on donations, including a cap on individual and corporate contributions, is crucial. Transparency can be further enhanced by making it mandatory for political parties to disclose the sources of their funds publicly, perhaps through a dedicated online portal maintained by the Election Commission of India (ECI). The introduction of Electoral Bonds was intended to bring transparency, but concerns remain regarding their anonymity. Dr. Krishnamurthy Subramanian’s report, submitted some years ago, also highlighted the need for comprehensive reforms in this area.", "normalised": "One critical area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another important reform pertains to criminalization of politics. Despite numerous court judgements and the ECI's efforts, individuals with criminal records continue to contest elections. Expediting the trials of politicians facing criminal charges and barring convicted individuals from contesting elections for life are necessary steps. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has consistently highlighted the alarming increase in candidates with criminal backgrounds in each election cycle.", "normalised": "Another important reform pertains to criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, addressing the issue of paid news and fake news is essential. These forms of disinformation can significantly influence voters and distort the electoral process. Strengthening the regulatory framework to tackle paid news, enhancing media literacy among citizens, and empowering the ECI to take stricter action against purveyors of fake news are vital. Robust fact-checking mechanisms and public awareness campaigns are needed, especially in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where misinformation can easily spread.", "normalised": "Furthermore, addressing the issue of paid news and fake news is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Voter turnout remains a concern, particularly among marginalized communities and migrant workers. Implementing measures to facilitate remote voting, expanding postal ballot facilities, and conducting voter awareness campaigns in vernacular languages can help improve participation. Linking Aadhaar with voter IDs, while controversial, could potentially reduce voter fraud and streamline the electoral process. However, data privacy concerns need to be addressed carefully, ensuring compliance with the Puttaswamy judgment.", "normalised": "Voter turnout remains a concern, particularly among marginalized communities and migrant workers.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the ECI is crucial. Providing the ECI with adequate resources, ensuring its financial autonomy, and protecting its members from undue political interference are essential for maintaining its impartiality and effectiveness. Establishing a collegium-based system for appointing Election Commissioners, similar to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, could further safeguard its independence. Reforming election laws is a continuous process, requiring constant vigilance and adaptation to emerging challenges. Ensuring a level playing field for all political parties and candidates, protecting the rights of voters, and upholding the integrity of the electoral process are fundamental to strengthening the foundations of Indian democracy. These reforms are not merely academic exercises; they have real-world implications, affecting the lives of millions across the country, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, and impacting everything from infrastructure projects worth Rs. 500 crores to the price of land at Rs. 5000 per sq ft. in Mumbai.", "normalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the E C I is crucial.
