{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for the health of any democracy, and India, the world's largest democracy, is no exception. These reforms aim to enhance the integrity, transparency, and inclusivity of the electoral process, ensuring that the will of the people is accurately reflected in governance. Over the years, several committees and commissions, including the Tarkunde Committee and the Dinesh Goswami Committee, have recommended significant changes to the electoral landscape.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for the health of any democracy, and India, the world's largest democracy, is no exception.

{"unnormalised": "One major area of reform revolves around campaign finance. Currently, there are concerns about the influence of black money and corporate funding on elections. Proposals include stricter regulations on campaign spending limits for parties and individual candidates like Mr. Sharma contesting from Varanasi, mandatory disclosure of sources of funding, and the establishment of a National Election Fund to provide state funding to political parties. The argument is that limiting private contributions and providing public funding creates a more level playing field and reduces the potential for corruption. Currently, limits exist (e.g., Rs. 70 lakhs for Lok Sabha elections in larger states), but enforcement remains a challenge.", "normalised": "One major area of reform revolves around campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect concerns criminalization of politics. Candidates with criminal records are often able to contest elections, which undermines the credibility of the democratic process. Reforms suggested include barring individuals facing serious criminal charges from contesting elections and expediting the adjudication of criminal cases against politicians. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has repeatedly urged for stronger laws in this regard. The infamous case of Pappu Yadav serves as a stark reminder of this issue.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect concerns criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the issue of paid news and fake news has become increasingly relevant in the digital age. During the 2019 elections, the ECI took action against several instances of paid news, highlighting the need for stronger regulations and monitoring mechanisms. There’s a call to make social media platforms more accountable for the content they host and to combat the spread of misinformation that can influence voters. Dr. Meena, a professor at JNU, researches extensively on this topic.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the issue of paid news and fake news has become increasingly relevant in the digital age.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and electoral rolls are also areas needing attention. Ensuring accurate and up-to-date electoral rolls is vital for preventing voter disenfranchisement and bogus voting. Linking Aadhaar with voter ID, while debated for privacy concerns, is suggested by some as a way to eliminate duplicate entries. Simplification of the voter registration process and awareness campaigns targeting marginalized communities can further enhance voter participation. A polling booth might cover an area of 1000 sq ft.", "normalised": "Voter registration and electoral rolls are also areas needing attention.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, electoral reforms also encompass internal democracy within political parties. Transparency in party functioning, including the selection of candidates and internal elections, is crucial for fostering accountability and preventing dynastic politics. Ensuring women's representation in political parties and legislatures is also a key objective. The Women's Reservation Bill, proposing 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, remains a pending but vital piece of legislation. Electoral reforms are not a one-time activity but an ongoing process vital for upholding the integrity and effectiveness of Indian democracy and ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard.", "normalised": "Finally, electoral reforms also encompass internal democracy within political parties. Transparency in party functioning, including the selection of candidates and internal elections, is crucial for fostering accountability and preventing dynastic politics.
