{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of a democratic system. In India, the world’s largest democracy, continuous improvements to the electoral process are vital to maintain public trust and promote fair representation. Over the years, various committees and commissions, like the Goswami Committee and the Vohra Committee, have suggested reforms to address concerns regarding money power, criminalization of politics, and transparency.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of a democratic system.

{"unnormalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance. The current system allows for significant opacity in funding sources, raising concerns about quid pro quo arrangements. Proposals for state funding of elections, coupled with stricter regulations on corporate donations, are often debated. Many argue that capping individual contributions and mandating disclosure of donors above a certain threshold (e.g., Rs. 20,000) would enhance transparency and level the playing field. The introduction of Electoral Bonds, while intended to increase transparency, has faced criticism regarding the anonymity afforded to donors.", "normalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant reform needed is addressing the criminalization of politics. The presence of individuals with criminal records in legislatures undermines public confidence. Speedy trials for politicians accused of crimes, disqualification of candidates facing serious charges, and enhanced vetting procedures are crucial steps. The Supreme Court's directives on publishing criminal antecedents of candidates in newspapers and on TV channels (e.g. Zee News) aim to empower voters with information.", "normalised": "Another significant reform needed is addressing the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also areas demanding attention. Simplifying the voter registration process, especially for migrant workers and first-time voters, is essential. Initiatives like online registration and mobile applications can improve accessibility. Furthermore, steps to increase voter turnout, such as promoting voter education campaigns, establishing more polling booths in rural areas (especially in states like Bihar and UP), and exploring the possibility of postal ballots for specific categories of voters, are vital.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation are also areas demanding attention.

{"unnormalised": "Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have been a subject of debate. While EVMs offer benefits like faster counting and reduced paper waste, concerns about their security and potential for manipulation persist. Strengthening the security protocols of EVMs, conducting regular audits, and providing Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) are necessary to maintain public confidence. Dr. S.Y. Quraishi, former Chief Election Commissioner of India, advocated for greater use of VVPATs and public awareness campaigns to address concerns.", "normalised": "Electronic Voting Machines (E V M s) have been a subject of debate.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, reservation of seats for women in legislatures is a long-pending reform. Increasing women’s representation in Parliament and state assemblies would enhance inclusivity and bring diverse perspectives to policymaking. The Women’s Reservation Bill, which proposes reserving 33% of seats for women, has been debated for years and its passage remains a critical step. Enacting comprehensive electoral reforms is crucial for strengthening Indian democracy and ensuring that the electoral process remains fair, transparent, and credible in the face of evolving challenges. Ignoring these reforms could lead to a situation where faith in the democratic process erodes, potentially affecting even seemingly unrelated areas like property valuation, say impacting the sq ft rate of commercial real estate in Connaught Place, Delhi, due to political instability.", "normalised": "Finally, reservation of seats for women in legislatures is a long-pending reform.
