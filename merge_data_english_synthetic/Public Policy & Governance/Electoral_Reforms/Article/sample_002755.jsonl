{"unnormalised": "One primary area needing attention is campaign finance. The influence of money in elections remains a significant concern. Currently, corporate funding is permitted, subject to certain restrictions, but the lack of transparency surrounding the sources and expenditure of funds breeds suspicion and potential corruption. Proposals for a state-funded election system, though complex, warrant serious consideration. Greater transparency through mandatory disclosure requirements, enforced rigorously by the Election Commission of India (ECI), is essential. Stringent limits on campaign spending, accompanied by effective monitoring mechanisms, can level the playing field and prevent undue influence of wealthy individuals and corporations. The current permissible expenditure limit for Lok Sabha elections, ranging from Rs. 54 lakh to Rs. 70 lakh depending on the state, needs to be periodically reviewed and realistically adjusted for inflation and changing campaign strategies.", "normalised": "one primary area needing attention is campaign finance. the influence of money in elections remains a significant concern. currently, corporate funding is permitted, subject to certain restrictions, but the lack of transparency surrounding the sources and expenditure of funds breeds suspicion and potential corruption. proposals for a state-funded election system, though complex, warrant serious consideration. greater transparency through mandatory disclosure requirements, enforced rigorously by the Election Commission of India (E C I), is essential. stringent limits on campaign spending, accompanied by effective monitoring mechanisms, can level the playing field and prevent undue influence of wealthy individuals and corporations. the current permissible expenditure limit for Lok Sabha elections, ranging from rupees fifty four lakh to rupees seventy lakh depending on the state, needs to be periodically reviewed and realistically adjusted for inflation and changing campaign strategies."}
{"unnormalised": "Another crucial reform area pertains to criminalization of politics. The alarming number of candidates with criminal records contesting elections undermines public trust in the political system. Speedy trials and disqualification of individuals convicted of heinous crimes are imperative. The ECI's efforts to publicize criminal records of candidates are commendable, but more decisive action, potentially including amending the Representation of the People Act, 1951, is necessary to bar individuals with serious criminal charges from contesting elections until they are acquitted.", "normalised": "another crucial reform area pertains to criminalization of politics. the alarming number of candidates with criminal records contesting elections undermines public trust in the political system. speedy trials and disqualification of individuals convicted of heinous crimes are imperative. the E C I's efforts to publicize criminal records of candidates are commendable, but more decisive action, potentially including amending the Representation of the People Act, one thousand nine hundred and fifty one, is necessary to bar individuals with serious criminal charges from contesting elections until they are acquitted."}
{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also areas ripe for improvement. While the ECI has made strides in simplifying the voter registration process, challenges remain, particularly among marginalized communities and migrant workers. Online voter registration facilities should be further strengthened and awareness campaigns should be intensified, particularly in rural areas. Addressing the issue of voter turnout, particularly among the youth, requires innovative approaches, such as promoting voter education in schools and colleges.", "normalised": "voter registration and participation are also areas ripe for improvement. while the E C I has made strides in simplifying the voter registration process, challenges remain, particularly among marginalized communities and migrant workers. online voter registration facilities should be further strengthened and awareness campaigns should be intensified, particularly in rural areas. addressing the issue of voter turnout, particularly among the youth, requires innovative approaches, such as promoting voter education in schools and colleges."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms should also address the issue of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT). While EVMs have significantly reduced booth capturing and improved efficiency, concerns regarding their security and tamper-proofness persist. Enhanced transparency in the EVM manufacturing and programming process, coupled with rigorous auditing and verification procedures, can alleviate public anxieties. VVPATs provide an essential audit trail, and their effective utilization during counting is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.", "normalised": "furthermore, electoral reforms should also address the issue of electronic voting machines (E V M s) and voter verifiable paper audit trail (V V P A T). while E V M s have significantly reduced booth capturing and improved efficiency, concerns regarding their security and tamper-proofness persist. enhanced transparency in the E V M manufacturing and programming process, coupled with rigorous auditing and verification procedures, can alleviate public anxieties.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, reforms addressing the first-past-the-post system warrant discussion. Alternative electoral systems, such as proportional representation, might lead to a more representative outcome reflecting the diversity of Indian society. However, any such change would require careful consideration and widespread public consultation. Just like enjoying a delicious Onam sadhya in Kerala, where each dish contributes to the overall experience, each aspect of electoral reform must be carefully considered to create a balanced and effective system that strengthens democracy and fosters better public policy and governance. Addressing these reforms comprehensively will ultimately contribute to a stronger, more inclusive, and more representative democracy in India.", "normalised": "finally, reforms addressing the first-past-the-post system warrant discussion. alternative electoral systems, such as proportional representation, might lead to a more representative outcome reflecting the diversity of Indian society. however, any such change would require careful consideration and widespread public consultation. just like enjoying a delicious Onam sadhya in Kerala, where each dish contributes to the overall experience, each aspect of electoral reform must be carefully considered to create a balanced and effective system that strengthens democracy and fosters better public policy and governance. addressing these reforms comprehensively will ultimately contribute to a stronger, more inclusive, and more representative democracy in India."}
