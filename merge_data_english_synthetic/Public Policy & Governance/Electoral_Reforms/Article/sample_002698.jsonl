{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing issues demanding attention is criminalization of politics. The presence of individuals with criminal records in the electoral arena undermines public trust and distorts the democratic process. Measures such as stricter scrutiny of candidate affidavits, expedited trials for politicians facing criminal charges, and lifetime bans for convicted individuals from contesting elections are essential. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has repeatedly advocated for such measures, but legislative action remains slow.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing issues demanding attention is criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area requiring reform is campaign finance. The opacity surrounding political funding creates avenues for corruption and undue influence by vested interests. Implementing stricter regulations on campaign expenditure, enhancing transparency in donations, and exploring the feasibility of state funding of elections are vital steps. Currently, the Rs. 20,000 threshold for disclosing donations needs reassessment, especially considering the scale of modern electoral campaigns.", "normalised": "Another significant area requiring reform is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "The Model Code of Conduct (MCC), a set of guidelines issued by the ECI, also requires strengthening. Its enforcement needs to be more rigorous and uniform across the country to prevent misuse of government machinery and ensure a level playing field for all political parties.
