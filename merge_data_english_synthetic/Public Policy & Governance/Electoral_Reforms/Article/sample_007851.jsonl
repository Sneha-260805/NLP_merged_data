{"unnormalised": "One major area of focus is campaign finance. The current system often lacks transparency, making it difficult to track the source and flow of funds used during elections. Opacity can lead to undue influence of money and muscle power, creating an uneven playing field. The introduction of measures like electoral bonds, while intended to increase transparency, has faced criticism for potential anonymity issues. Experts like Dr. Meera Sharma, a renowned political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), suggest exploring alternative funding models such as state funding of elections, either fully or partially, to reduce reliance on private donations and promote a level playing field.", "normalised": "One major area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial aspect is addressing criminalization in politics. Candidates with criminal backgrounds often manage to contest and even win elections. Strengthening the legal framework to disqualify individuals with serious criminal charges and expediting trials of politicians facing criminal allegations are vital steps. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has taken steps like making it mandatory for candidates to declare their criminal records, but more stringent measures are needed to deter individuals with criminal tendencies from entering the political arena.", "normalised": "Another crucial aspect is addressing criminalization in politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also key areas for reform. While the ECI has implemented initiatives like the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) to enhance the security and credibility of the voting process, efforts are needed to improve voter registration, particularly among marginalized communities and young voters. Simplifying the registration process and conducting targeted awareness campaigns in rural areas and urban slums can significantly increase voter turnout. For instance, initiatives similar to the \"SVEEP\" (Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation) program could be intensified at the district level, targeting specific demographics in places like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where voter turnout is historically lower.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation are also key areas for reform.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, reforms addressing the Delimitation process, which involves redrawing constituency boundaries based on population changes, are also necessary. Ensuring fair and equitable representation across different regions is crucial for maintaining the legitimacy of the electoral process. The last delimitation exercise was based on the 2001 census, and a new exercise is overdue. However, concerns about potentially disadvantaging states that have controlled their population growth need to be addressed. A balanced approach is required to ensure that the delimitation process promotes fairness and equity while incentivizing population control.", "normalised": "Furthermore, reforms addressing the Delimitation process, which involves redrawing constituency boundaries based on population changes, are also necessary.

{"unnormalised": "Reforms regarding the functioning of political parties themselves are also important. Bringing greater transparency and accountability into the internal processes of political parties, including candidate selection and financial management, can strengthen the democratic fabric of the country. For example, encouraging internal party elections and mandating public disclosure of party finances can enhance accountability and reduce the potential for corruption.", "normalised": "Reforms regarding the functioning of political parties themselves are also important.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, electoral reforms are an ongoing process. Continuous evaluation, adaptation, and implementation of new measures are essential to ensure that the Indian electoral system remains robust, credible, and responsive to the needs of its citizens. It requires the collective efforts of the government, the ECI, political parties, civil society organizations, and individual citizens to safeguard the integrity of the democratic process and promote a more just and equitable society. The cost of these reforms, though potentially significant in terms of Rs., is dwarfed by the cost of a flawed democracy measured in lost opportunities and eroded public trust. Even a small improvement in efficiency, say covering an additional 100 sq ft of polling area per booth with better infrastructure, can have a massive positive impact across a constituency spanning hundreds of kilometers (km).", "normalised": "Ultimately, electoral reforms are an ongoing process.
