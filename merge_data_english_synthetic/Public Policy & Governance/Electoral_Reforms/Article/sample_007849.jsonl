{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity, transparency, and inclusivity of the democratic process in India. They represent a continuous effort to refine the mechanisms by which citizens choose their representatives and shape the governance of the nation. Given India's vast population and diverse socio-economic landscape, electoral reforms are not merely desirable, but essential for maintaining public trust and strengthening the foundation of Indian democracy.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for ensuring the integrity, transparency, and inclusivity of the democratic process in India.

{"unnormalised": "One key area of reform concerns campaign finance. The current system, despite regulations, is often plagued by opaqueness and the undue influence of money. Strict limits on campaign spending, coupled with enhanced transparency measures – such as mandatory disclosure of sources of funding, even small donations above Rs. 2,000 – are vital. The Dinesh Goswami Committee report (1990) and subsequent recommendations by various bodies have highlighted the need for state funding of elections to level the playing field and reduce the reliance on corporate and individual donors.", "normalised": "One key area of reform concerns campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area focuses on criminalization of politics. Individuals with pending criminal charges or convictions should be barred from contesting elections. While the Representation of the People Act, 1951, disqualifies convicted individuals, it needs to be strengthened to address the issue of individuals facing serious criminal charges. Fast-tracking court cases involving politicians and enacting stringent laws to prevent the entry of criminals into the electoral arena are imperative. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has repeatedly advocated for this, emphasizing its importance in maintaining the sanctity of the electoral process.", "normalised": "Another significant area focuses on criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral roll management requires continuous improvement. Errors in voter lists, including duplicate entries and the exclusion of eligible voters, remain a persistent challenge, particularly in densely populated areas like Delhi and Mumbai. Regular verification drives, leveraging technology such as Aadhaar linking (subject to Supreme Court guidelines), and simplifying the voter registration process are crucial. The introduction of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) was a significant step, but concerns regarding their security and vulnerability to tampering persist. Enhancing EVM security protocols and exploring alternative technologies, such as Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), can address these concerns and bolster voter confidence.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral roll management requires continuous improvement.

{"unnormalised": "The ECI, under the leadership of Chief Election Commissioner Dr. Rajiv Kumar, constantly strives to enhance voter awareness and participation. Initiatives like the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) program aim to educate citizens about their voting rights and responsibilities. Encouraging greater participation of marginalized communities, including women and persons with disabilities, is also a priority. Providing accessible polling booths, conducting voter education campaigns in local languages, and promoting the use of assistive technologies can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to exercise their franchise.", "normalised": "The E C I, under the leadership of Chief Election Commissioner Doctor Rajiv Kumar, constantly strives to enhance voter awareness and participation.

{"unnormalised": "Delimitation of constituencies, aimed at ensuring equitable representation based on population, is another important aspect. While the number of Lok Sabha seats has remained fixed since 1971, demographic shifts necessitate a periodic review and readjustment of constituency boundaries. This process must be conducted transparently and impartially, taking into account factors such as geographical contiguity and administrative units. The area of a typical polling booth shouldn't exceed 1500 sq ft, to ensure accessibility.", "normalised": "Delimitation of constituencies, aimed at ensuring equitable representation based on population, is another important aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the ECI is paramount. Ensuring that the ECI has the necessary resources and powers to effectively enforce electoral laws and regulations is crucial for maintaining its credibility and effectiveness. Reforms in the appointment process of Election Commissioners, perhaps involving a broader consultation process, could further enhance the ECI's independence. Ultimately, continuous and comprehensive electoral reforms are essential for safeguarding the democratic ideals enshrined in the Indian Constitution and ensuring a more just and equitable society for all.", "normalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the E C I is paramount.
