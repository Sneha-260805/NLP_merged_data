{"unnormalised": "One of the critical areas requiring attention is campaign finance. The unchecked flow of money during elections remains a significant concern. The recommendations of the Election Commission of India (ECI) regarding stricter regulations on corporate funding and the establishment of a National Election Fund to support candidates with clean records deserve serious consideration. Ensuring transparency in political party funding, as advocated by various committees including the Dinesh Goswami Committee, is vital to level the playing field and prevent undue influence of money power.", "normalised": "One of the critical areas requiring attention is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of focus is criminalisation of politics. The presence of individuals with criminal backgrounds in legislative bodies erodes public trust in the system. While measures like mandatory declaration of assets and criminal records by candidates have been implemented, their effectiveness is limited. Expediting trials of politicians facing criminal charges, as directed by the Supreme Court, is essential. Perhaps a lifetime ban from contesting elections for individuals convicted of serious offences could act as a stronger deterrent.", "normalised": "Another area of focus is criminalisation of politics.

Promoting greater participation of ordinary members in decision-making processes and ensuring transparent selection of candidates can reduce the dominance of dynastic politics, a persistent criticism leveled against many political entities in India. The ECI has repeatedly urged parties to amend their constitutions to reflect these principles.", "normalised": "Furthermore, internal democracy within political parties needs strengthening.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and awareness are also crucial elements. Simplifying the voter registration process, especially for marginalized communities and young adults, can improve voter turnout. Enhanced voter education programs, utilizing innovative methods like street plays and targeting specific demographic groups, are necessary. The concept of postal ballots for senior citizens and persons with disabilities has been successfully implemented, but its wider application requires further refinement.", "normalised": "Voter registration and awareness are also crucial elements.

{"unnormalised": "The use of technology in elections, including electronic voting machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), has been a significant step towards ensuring accuracy and transparency. However, concerns regarding EVM tampering persist. Addressing these concerns through enhanced security protocols and wider dissemination of information on the robustness of the system is paramount. The introduction of remote voting for migrant workers, a significant demographic segment particularly affected during events like the COVID-19 pandemic, requires careful consideration and piloting.", "normalised": "The use of technology in elections, including electronic voting machines (E V Ms) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (V V P A T), has been a significant step towards ensuring accuracy and transparency.

Just as different regions of India celebrate Onam with diverse culinary delights, including the beloved biryani, so too should electoral reforms be tailored to reflect the evolving needs and aspirations of the Indian electorate. The spirit of continuous improvement, guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, is essential to safeguard the integrity and legitimacy of India's democratic processes. Continuous dialogue between the ECI, political parties, civil society organizations, and the public is crucial to identify emerging challenges and formulate effective solutions. The goal should be a truly representative and participatory democracy where every vote counts and every voice is heard.", "normalised": "Finally, electoral reforms should not be viewed as a one-time exercise but as a continuous process.
