{"unnormalised": "One significant area of focus has been strengthening the Election Commission of India (ECI). Its independence and authority are crucial for maintaining public trust in the electoral process. Recent discussions have centered on ensuring the ECI's financial autonomy and insulation from undue political influence. The appointment process of the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners has also been a subject of debate, with suggestions for a more transparent and multi-partisan selection mechanism.", "normalised": "One significant area of focus has been strengthening the Election Commission of India (E C I).

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial area is campaign finance. The opacity surrounding political donations and the influence of money power remain significant concerns. The introduction of electoral bonds aimed to curb black money but has faced criticism regarding its transparency and potential for quid pro quo arrangements. Proposals for state funding of elections, while complex to implement, are being considered as a potential solution to level the playing field and reduce the reliance on private donations.", "normalised": "Another crucial area is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "The Representation of the People Act, 1951, has been amended several times to address specific issues. For instance, amendments have been introduced to prevent candidates with criminal backgrounds from contesting elections. However, the effectiveness of these provisions is often hampered by legal loopholes and the slow pace of judicial proceedings. The need for stricter enforcement and more comprehensive legislation is widely acknowledged.", "normalised": "The Representation of the People Act, one thousand nine hundred and fifty one, has been amended several times to address specific issues.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also critical components of a healthy electoral system. Efforts are underway to simplify the voter registration process, particularly for marginalized communities and first-time voters. Initiatives like online registration and special camps in remote areas aim to increase voter turnout. The use of technology, such as electronic voting machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), has enhanced transparency and accountability in the voting process.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation are also critical components of a healthy electoral system.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, discussions regarding electoral reforms often touch upon issues such as proportional representation, simultaneous elections, and the right to recall. While these proposals have their merits, their implementation would require significant political consensus and careful consideration of their potential impact on the Indian political landscape. Imagine deciding between different ‘biryani’ recipes - each tempting in its own way, but demanding careful evaluation before choosing the perfect one! Similarly, electoral reforms need careful planning and implementation.", "normalised": "Furthermore, discussions regarding electoral reforms often touch upon issues such as proportional representation, simultaneous elections, and the right to recall.

{"unnormalised": "The debate on electoral reforms in India is ongoing and multifaceted. It reflects the commitment to upholding democratic principles and ensuring that the electoral process remains robust and responsive to the needs of the citizens. Further reforms might include regulations around fake news and social media influence, costing the exchequer Rs. 500 Crores. These should be monitored closely by a parliamentary committee of 20 members including those from Tamil Nadu. The journey to a truly perfect electoral system is a continuous process.", "normalised": "The debate on electoral reforms in India is ongoing and multifaceted.
