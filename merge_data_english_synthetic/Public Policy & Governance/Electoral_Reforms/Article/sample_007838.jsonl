{"unnormalised": "One key area of reform revolves around campaign finance. The current system allows for opacity in funding sources, raising concerns about the influence of money in elections. Proposals include stricter regulations on corporate donations, mandatory disclosure of all donations above Rs. 20,000, and state funding of elections. Many argue that this could level the playing field and reduce the scope for corruption. For example, the Dinesh Goswami Committee (1990) and the Indrajit Gupta Committee (1998) have previously recommended partial state funding of elections.", "normalised": "One key area of reform revolves around campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect is addressing criminalization in politics. The presence of individuals with criminal backgrounds in legislative bodies undermines public trust and distorts the democratic process. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has consistently highlighted the alarming rise in the number of MPs and MLAs with pending criminal cases. Reforms like stricter disqualification criteria, faster trials for politicians facing criminal charges, and mandatory disclosure of criminal antecedents are essential.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect is addressing criminalization in politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation also warrant attention. Despite efforts by the Election Commission of India (ECI), significant numbers of eligible voters remain unregistered, particularly among marginalized communities. Streamlining the registration process, conducting targeted voter awareness campaigns, and exploring options like online registration are crucial. The introduction of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) has improved transparency and accuracy, but continuous improvements and public education about their functionality are still needed.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation also warrant attention.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral boundaries require periodic review to ensure fair representation. Delimitation exercises, though sensitive, are necessary to account for population shifts and prevent gerrymandering. These exercises should be conducted by an independent body, ensuring impartiality and adherence to constitutional principles.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral boundaries require periodic review to ensure fair representation.

{"unnormalised": "The Model Code of Conduct (MCC), a set of guidelines issued by the ECI, plays a vital role in ensuring free and fair elections.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, electoral reforms are an ongoing process. They require continuous evaluation, adaptation, and collaboration between the government, the ECI, political parties, civil society organizations like PRS Legislative Research, and informed citizens like Dr. Rajesh Sharma, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). The aim should be to build a more robust, transparent, and representative democracy where every voice is heard, and every vote counts, regardless of whether they live in a sprawling 10,000 sq ft bungalow in Delhi or a small village 100 km away.", "normalised": "Ultimately, electoral reforms are an ongoing process.
