{"unnormalised": "One of the key areas requiring attention is campaign finance. Currently, there are concerns about the use of black money and opaque funding sources influencing elections. Proposals to increase transparency through mandatory disclosure of donor details and stricter limits on campaign expenditure are actively debated. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has consistently advocated for a national electoral fund to provide public funding to political parties, leveling the playing field and reducing reliance on private donations. A system similar to that used in some European nations could be explored, tailored to the Indian context.", "normalised": "One of the key areas requiring attention is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial reform focuses on curbing criminalization in politics. Candidates with pending criminal charges often contest elections, undermining public trust and potentially influencing governance negatively. Fast-tracking trials of politicians accused of crimes and barring convicted individuals from contesting elections are vital steps. The Supreme Court of India has played a significant role in pushing for greater disclosure of criminal antecedents by candidates, but further legislative action is needed to fully address this menace.", "normalised": "Another crucial reform focuses on curbing criminalization in politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation also remain areas for improvement. Simplifying the registration process, particularly for marginalized communities and first-time voters, is paramount. Exploring options like online registration and mobile voting (with appropriate safeguards) could significantly increase voter turnout, especially among younger demographics. The ECI has already implemented measures like voter awareness campaigns and the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), but continuous innovation is necessary.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation also remain areas for improvement.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, reforms are needed to address the issue of paid news and fake news, which can distort public opinion and manipulate electoral outcomes. Stricter regulations on media ownership, increased monitoring of social media platforms, and public awareness campaigns promoting media literacy are essential. The Press Council of India has a crucial role to play in upholding journalistic ethics and combating the spread of misinformation.", "normalised": "Furthermore, reforms are needed to address the issue of paid news and fake news, which can distort public opinion and manipulate electoral outcomes.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of electoral bonds, while intended to increase transparency in campaign funding, has faced scrutiny due to concerns about their anonymity. Many experts, including Dr. A.P.J. Kalam's former advisors, believe these bonds need further review to ensure genuine transparency and accountability. There are also ongoing discussions about implementing proportional representation, at least partially, to ensure better representation of diverse groups and smaller political parties.", "normalised": "The implementation of electoral bonds, while intended to increase transparency in campaign funding, has faced scrutiny due to concerns about their anonymity.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, delimitation exercises, which redraw constituency boundaries based on population changes, are essential for ensuring equal representation. The next delimitation exercise, based on the 2031 census, will be a significant undertaking. Fair and transparent procedures, taking into account geographical considerations and social demographics (like areas with a density of 1000 people per sq km in urban centers like Mumbai or Chennai, and specific tribal populations in areas like Jharkhand or Chhattisgarh), are crucial to maintain public confidence.", "normalised": "Moreover, delimitation exercises, which redraw constituency boundaries based on population changes, are essential for ensuring equal representation.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the ECI is vital. Providing adequate resources, protecting its officers from political interference, and ensuring its decisions are respected are essential for upholding the integrity of the electoral process. The ECI's annual budget is crucial, estimated around Rs. 2000 crore, needs to be safeguarded from cuts or manipulation.", "normalised": "Finally, strengthening the independence and autonomy of the E C I is vital.
