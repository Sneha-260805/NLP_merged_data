{"unnormalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance. Currently, regulations exist to limit expenditure by candidates and parties during elections. However, concerns persist regarding the influence of black money and corporate funding. Proposals for state funding of elections, albeit controversial, aim to level the playing field and reduce the reliance on private donations. Implementing stricter regulations on political donations and mandating greater transparency, including disclosing the sources of funds exceeding Rs. 20,000, are vital steps. The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a pivotal role in enforcing these regulations.", "normalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant aspect is addressing criminalization in politics. Despite disqualification upon conviction, individuals with pending criminal charges can still contest elections. Speedy trials and stricter criteria for disqualification are necessary to prevent individuals with serious criminal backgrounds from entering legislatures. The debate around banning candidates with pending criminal charges is ongoing, but the urgency to purify the political process is undeniable.", "normalised": "Another significant aspect is addressing criminalization in politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also critical areas. While the ECI has undertaken various initiatives to increase voter awareness and registration, including online registration and special camps, challenges remain, especially among marginalized communities. Simplifying the voter registration process and conducting targeted outreach programs in areas with low voter turnout are crucial. Introducing measures like postal ballots for senior citizens and persons with disabilities can also boost participation. Furthermore, linking Aadhar to voter IDs, though debated due to privacy concerns, is proposed to remove duplicate entries.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation are also critical areas.

{"unnormalised": "The electronic voting machine (EVM) has been a cornerstone of Indian elections, significantly reducing booth capturing and improving accuracy. However, concerns regarding the security and transparency of EVMs persist. Regularly updating the technology, conducting thorough audits, and allowing for voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPAT) are essential to maintain public trust. The VVPAT provides a physical record that voters can verify, strengthening the integrity of the voting process.", "normalised": "The electronic voting machine (E V M) has been a cornerstone of Indian elections, significantly reducing booth capturing and improving accuracy.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms should address issues like delimitation of constituencies to reflect population changes and ensure equitable representation. Implementing a rotational reservation system for women in Parliament and state legislatures could further enhance inclusivity. The Nirvachan Sadan, the ECI headquarters in Delhi, is at the forefront of driving many of these changes.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms should address issues like delimitation of constituencies to reflect population changes and ensure equitable representation.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, successful electoral reforms require a multi-pronged approach involving the government, the ECI, political parties, civil society organizations, and the citizens themselves. Continued dialogue and consensus-building are essential to create a more robust and representative democracy where the voice of every citizen, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is heard and valued. Dr. Sharma’s committee report on electoral reforms is still relevant and provides valuable insights. Even small improvements, such as ensuring every polling booth has adequate facilities (drinking water, ramps for the disabled, shade) within a 100 sq ft area, can significantly improve the voting experience.", "normalised": "Ultimately, successful electoral reforms require a multi-pronged approach involving the government, the E C I, political parties, civil society organizations, and the citizens themselves.
