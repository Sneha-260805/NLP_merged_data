{"unnormalised": "One significant area is campaign finance. Currently, the lack of complete transparency in funding sources raises concerns about undue influence. While the introduction of electoral bonds was intended to streamline donations, their anonymity has faced criticism. Reforms are needed to ensure greater accountability and prevent the use of black money in elections. For example, capping individual and corporate donations, along with stringent auditing of campaign expenditures, could bring more transparency. Perhaps linking donations above Rs. 20,000 directly to PAN card numbers could improve traceability.", "normalised": "One significant area is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect is the criminalization of politics. The presence of individuals with criminal records in legislative bodies undermines the democratic process. While the Election Commission of India (ECI) has taken steps to increase awareness and require candidates to disclose pending criminal cases, further measures are necessary. Fast-tracking trials of politicians facing criminal charges and disqualifying individuals convicted of serious offenses are crucial steps. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has consistently highlighted this issue, emphasizing the need for stronger legal frameworks.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect is the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and participation are also essential. While initiatives like Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) have improved the voting process, ensuring universal access to registration remains a challenge, especially for marginalized communities and migrant workers. Streamlining the registration process, conducting voter awareness campaigns in remote areas, and exploring options like online registration could boost participation. Dr. Kumar, a leading expert on electoral law, suggests mobile registration camps in areas with low registration rates.", "normalised": "Voter registration and participation are also essential.

Strengthening its autonomy and providing it with adequate resources are essential for its smooth operation. The appointment process of Election Commissioners should also be made more transparent and inclusive.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the functioning of the Election Commission of India itself needs periodic review to ensure its independence and effectiveness.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the issue of delimitation needs attention. The current delimitation exercise, based on the 2001 census, needs updating to reflect population changes accurately and ensure fair representation for all regions. This is a sensitive issue, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where significant population growth has occurred. Moreover, the representation of women in Parliament remains low. Reservation of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, though debated for years, requires decisive action. A constitutional amendment in this regard is long overdue. Consider the impact on a constituency covering an area of 1000 sq km; adequate representation is paramount. Addressing these and other challenges through comprehensive electoral reforms is vital for strengthening Indian democracy and ensuring its long-term stability.", "normalised": "Finally, the issue of delimitation needs attention.
