{"unnormalised": "One significant area needing reform is campaign finance. The current system, while having some regulations, often lacks transparency. Opacity allows for the influence of “black money” and corporate lobbying, creating an uneven playing field for smaller parties and independent candidates. Suggestions often include stricter enforcement of existing laws, mandatory disclosure of donor information (above a certain threshold, say Rs. 20,000), and state funding of elections, a practice already implemented in some form in countries like France. Think tanks like the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) have published detailed reports advocating for these changes.", "normalised": "One significant area needing reform is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect involves the representation of women and other historically marginalized groups. While reservation policies exist for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, the representation of women remains disproportionately low. The Women's Reservation Bill, proposing 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state legislative assemblies, has faced decades of political gridlock. Its enactment is paramount for achieving true gender parity in Indian politics, potentially inspiring more women like Nirmala Sitharaman to enter and thrive in leadership roles.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect involves the representation of women and other historically marginalized groups. While reservation policies exist for Scheduled Castes (S C s) and Scheduled Tribes (S T s) in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, the representation of women remains disproportionately low.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) system, while lauded for reducing ballot tampering, has faced scrutiny regarding its susceptibility to hacking and lack of verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs) awareness among voters. Ensuring adequate voter education programs, especially in rural areas like villages in Bihar covering vast areas of 100 sq km or more, is crucial. Independent audits of EVMs by technical experts and increased transparency in their storage and transportation can rebuild public trust. Dr. S.Y. Quraishi, former Chief Election Commissioner, has often emphasized the need for enhancing the robustness of the electoral process.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Electronic Voting Machine (E V M) system, while lauded for reducing ballot tampering, has faced scrutiny regarding its susceptibility to hacking and lack of verifiable paper audit trails (V V P A T s) awareness among voters.

{"unnormalised": "The anti-defection law, designed to prevent horse-trading, requires continuous refinement to close loopholes that allow mass defections under the guise of mergers. The role of independent institutions like the Election Commission of India (ECI) needs strengthening to enable them to act more decisively against electoral malpractices and enforce ethical conduct during elections. Ultimately, ongoing dialogue, research, and legislative action are essential to ensure that India's electoral system remains fair, transparent, and truly representative of its diverse population. Reforming electoral laws, much like the construction of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai required meticulous planning and execution, demands a long-term vision and unwavering commitment.", "normalised": "The anti-defection law, designed to prevent horse-trading, requires continuous refinement to close loopholes that allow mass defections under the guise of mergers.
