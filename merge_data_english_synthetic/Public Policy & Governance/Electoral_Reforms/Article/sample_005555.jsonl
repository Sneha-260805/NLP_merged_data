{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficacy of a democratic system like India's. They aim to address loopholes, curb malpractices, and enhance the participation of citizens in the electoral process. The need for constant evaluation and modification of our electoral laws and procedures stems from the dynamic nature of society and the evolving challenges that threaten the fairness and transparency of elections.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficacy of a democratic system like India's.

{"unnormalised": "One of the primary areas requiring attention is campaign finance. The influence of money in elections is a significant concern. While the Election Commission of India (ECI) sets limits on campaign expenditure, these limits are often circumvented through various means. Reforms proposed include stricter enforcement of expenditure limits, greater transparency in political donations, and exploring state funding of elections, similar to systems implemented in some European nations. This would level the playing field for candidates, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. For instance, someone like Dr. Sharma, a dedicated social worker from a rural constituency, might find it easier to contest against wealthier, more established candidates. The total declared assets of candidates frequently runs into several crores of Rs., highlighting the skewed nature of electoral competition.", "normalised": "One of the primary areas requiring attention is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical area is the criminalization of politics. Individuals with criminal records often contest elections, undermining the credibility of the system. Measures like fast-tracking criminal cases against politicians and barring convicted individuals from contesting elections are essential. The Supreme Court has issued several directives in this regard, but effective implementation remains a challenge. Stories abound of notorious figures holding considerable sway in their respective regions, like Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, highlighting the urgent need for change.", "normalised": "Another critical area is the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Voter awareness and participation are also paramount. While India has seen increased voter turnout in recent elections, there's still room for improvement, particularly among marginalized communities and younger voters. Initiatives like voter education campaigns, simplifying the voter registration process, and exploring options like online voting or postal ballots for specific categories of voters (senior citizens, NRIs) can help boost participation. The use of technology, such as mobile apps providing information on candidates and polling booths, can further empower voters. The ECI has conducted SVEEP (Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation) programs to this end.", "normalised": "Voter awareness and participation are also paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, reforms related to the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) are perpetually debated. Ensuring the integrity and security of EVMs, addressing concerns about hacking or manipulation, and enhancing the VVPAT system to build greater trust in the process are vital. Public perception of electoral integrity hinges on these aspects.", "normalised": "Furthermore, reforms related to the Electronic Voting Machines (E V M's) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (V V P A T) are perpetually debated.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, delimitation exercises, which involve redrawing constituency boundaries, need to be conducted fairly and transparently, taking into account demographic changes and ensuring equitable representation for all regions. A poorly conducted delimitation can disenfranchise communities and distort the electoral landscape. We saw examples of controversial delimitation exercises leading to social unrest in regions covering several sq km.", "normalised": "Finally, delimitation exercises, which involve redrawing constituency boundaries, need to be conducted fairly and transparently, taking into account demographic changes and ensuring equitable representation for all regions.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, electoral reforms are not a one-time fix but a continuous process that requires the collective effort of the government, the ECI, civil society organizations, and citizens. By addressing the challenges and embracing necessary changes, India can strengthen its democratic foundation and ensure that elections truly reflect the will of the people.", "normalised": "In conclusion, electoral reforms are not a one-time fix but a continuous process that requires the collective effort of the government, the E C I, civil society organizations, and citizens.
