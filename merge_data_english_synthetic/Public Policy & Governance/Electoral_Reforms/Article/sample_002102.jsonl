{"unnormalised": "One of the key areas addressed by electoral reforms is criminalization in politics. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) reports consistently highlight the presence of candidates with criminal records contesting elections. Measures such as stricter scrutiny of candidates' affidavits, fast-track courts to adjudicate cases against politicians, and enhanced powers for the Election Commission of India (ECI) are essential to combat this menace. Think of Bihar’s political landscape and the challenges faced there; transparency is paramount.", "normalised": "One of the key areas addressed by electoral reforms is criminalization in politics.

{"unnormalised": "Another vital aspect is campaign finance reform. The current system allows for significant opacity in political funding, creating opportunities for undue influence and corruption. The introduction of Electoral Bonds aimed to streamline donations but has faced criticism regarding its lack of transparency. Discussions around state funding of elections, limiting corporate donations, and promoting digital transactions for campaign expenses are ongoing. The expenditure limit for Lok Sabha elections is currently Rs. 70 lakh, varying slightly by state. This figure needs periodic review considering inflation and the changing dynamics of campaigning.", "normalised": "Another vital aspect is campaign finance reform.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, reforms related to voter registration and participation are crucial. Initiatives like the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) have enhanced transparency and voter confidence. However, continuous efforts are needed to ensure voter education, simplify the registration process, and address issues of voter suppression, particularly among marginalized communities. The challenge remains to reach every corner of India, from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the remote villages of Arunachal Pradesh.", "normalised": "Furthermore, reforms related to voter registration and participation are crucial.

{"unnormalised": "The role of social media in elections is another area demanding attention. Misinformation, hate speech, and fake news can significantly impact electoral outcomes.

{"unnormalised": "Delimitation of constituencies is also a significant area. The last delimitation exercise was conducted in 2002 based on the 1971 census, frozen until 2026. A fresh delimitation exercise is crucial to ensure equitable representation based on population changes. This can be politically sensitive, especially in states like Tamil Nadu that have successfully managed population growth.", "normalised": "Delimitation of constituencies is also a significant area.

{"unnormalised": "Independent and strong institutions like the ECI are vital for the success of electoral reforms.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, technology plays a significant role. Utilizing blockchain technology for secure voting, Artificial Intelligence for detecting fake news, and data analytics for better voter targeting are areas that hold promise. Imagine a polling booth with 500 sq ft space managed efficiently using technology; efficiency gains can be substantial. The path to electoral perfection is a journey, not a destination, demanding continuous adaptation and reform.", "normalised": "Finally, technology plays a significant role.
