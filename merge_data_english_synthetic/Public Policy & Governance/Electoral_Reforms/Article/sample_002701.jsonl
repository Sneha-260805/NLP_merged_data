{"unnormalised": "One crucial area requiring reform is campaign finance. The current system, despite regulations, is often marred by opaque funding sources and excessive expenditure. Implementing stricter disclosure norms, limiting corporate donations, and establishing a robust mechanism for auditing campaign accounts are vital. The exorbitant costs associated with contesting elections often create an uneven playing field, disadvantaging candidates from marginalized communities and smaller parties. Moreover, the prevalence of black money in elections distorts the democratic process and undermines public trust. We can look towards systems like those being developed at the Election Commission of India to further improve transparency.", "normalised": "One crucial area requiring reform is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical issue is criminalization in politics. Despite repeated calls for action, individuals with criminal records continue to contest elections. Expediting pending criminal cases against politicians and barring convicted individuals from contesting elections are crucial steps. The Representation of the People Act needs further strengthening to address this menace effectively, ensuring that the sanctity of the electoral process is preserved. The Vohra Committee report recommendations, though decades old, still hold relevance in addressing the nexus between crime and politics.", "normalised": "Another critical issue is criminalization in politics.

Simplifying voter registration procedures, expanding postal ballot facilities for senior citizens and persons with disabilities, and leveraging technology to enhance voting convenience are important considerations. Introduction of measures to ensure voting rights for migrant labourers who often face difficulties in registering and casting their votes in their native places is also warranted. Onam, the harvest festival of Kerala, witnesses mass migration, demonstrating the need for such reform.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the efficiency and accessibility of the electoral process need continuous improvement.

Strengthening the regulatory framework to monitor and combat the spread of misinformation, coupled with enhancing media literacy among citizens, is essential to ensure informed electoral participation.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, exploring alternative voting methods, such as proportional representation, to enhance representation of diverse sections of society deserves consideration. While the first-past-the-post system has served India well, a review of its limitations and a potential shift towards a more inclusive system could further strengthen democratic values. For example, some argue a mixed-member proportional system could balance regional representation with proportional representation based on party vote share.", "normalised": "Finally, exploring alternative voting methods, such as proportional representation, to enhance representation of diverse sections of society deserves consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, sustained and comprehensive electoral reforms are essential to fortify Indian democracy and enhance public policy and governance. These reforms must be driven by a commitment to transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and fairness, ensuring that the electoral process reflects the will of the people and serves as a robust foundation for national progress. The taste of truly representative biryani, with each grain distinct and flavorful, is only possible with fair and equitable ingredients. Similarly, good governance requires a fair and just electoral system.", "normalised": "Ultimately, sustained and comprehensive electoral reforms are essential to fortify Indian democracy and enhance public policy and governance.
