{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for strengthening democracy and ensuring fair representation in India. Over the years, several committees and commissions, including the Dinesh Goswami Committee (1990) and the Law Commission of India, have proposed various reforms to address prevailing challenges. These challenges range from the influence of money and muscle power to the increasing criminalization of politics and the lack of internal democracy within political parties.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for strengthening democracy and ensuring fair representation in India.

{"unnormalised": "One significant area of focus is campaign finance. The current system allows for opaque funding sources, creating avenues for undue influence by corporations and individuals. Proposals to increase transparency through mandatory disclosure of donors above a certain threshold (e.g., Rs. 20,000) and to introduce a state funding model for elections are frequently debated. Such measures aim to level the playing field and reduce reliance on private donations.", "normalised": "One significant area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical area is addressing criminalization. Despite disqualification provisions for convicted criminals, individuals facing serious charges often contest elections. Calls for stricter scrutiny during candidate nominations and expedited trials for politicians facing criminal accusations are persistent. The introduction of a “none of the above” (NOTA) option, while present, requires further evaluation regarding its impact on electoral outcomes and potential to force parties to nominate more credible candidates.", "normalised": "Another critical area is addressing criminalization.

The Women's Reservation Bill, proposing 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, has been pending for years. Its enactment would be a landmark achievement in promoting gender equality in Indian politics.", "normalised": "Furthermore, ensuring greater representation for women in Parliament remains a challenge.

{"unnormalised": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) has been proactive in implementing technology-driven solutions to improve efficiency and transparency. The use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) systems has largely streamlined the voting process. However, concerns about EVM tampering and the need for greater public awareness campaigns persist. Regular audits and independent verification mechanisms are essential to maintain public trust.", "normalised": "The Election Commission of India (E C I) has been proactive in implementing technology-driven solutions to improve efficiency and transparency.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond technical aspects, electoral reforms also require addressing the socio-economic factors that influence voting behavior. Voter education programs, particularly in rural areas, are vital for empowering citizens to make informed choices. The spirit of Onam, celebrating equality and prosperity, should ideally reflect in the inclusiveness and fairness of the electoral process. Increasing voter turnout, especially among marginalized communities, is a key objective. Initiatives like easier voter registration processes and expanding polling booth access are crucial.", "normalised": "Beyond technical aspects, electoral reforms also require addressing the socio-economic factors that influence voting behavior.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, internal democracy within political parties needs strengthening. Transparency in candidate selection, internal elections, and financial management are essential for promoting accountability and preventing dynastic politics. A robust regulatory framework, coupled with ethical leadership within parties, can foster a more democratic and representative political landscape. The debate regarding electoral bonds and their impact on political funding also highlights the constant need for re-evaluation and adaptation of policies to ensure a level playing field for all. Ensuring every vote counts is a fundamental principle, as crucial as the perfect blend of spices in a delicious plate of biryani.", "normalised": "Finally, internal democracy within political parties needs strengthening.
