{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are crucial for maintaining the health and integrity of any democratic system. In India, the world's largest democracy, the need for continuous reform is particularly pronounced, given the complexities of its diverse electorate and evolving socio-political landscape.

{"unnormalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance. The current system allows for opaque funding sources, creating avenues for corruption and undue influence. Proposals include stricter regulations on political donations, mandating disclosure of all sources above Rs. 20,000, and establishing a National Electoral Fund to provide equitable funding to political parties. This would level the playing field and reduce the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations. Dr. Manmohan Singh's government initiated discussions on state funding, but consensus remains elusive.", "normalised": "One key area of focus is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical area is electoral roll management. Discrepancies and inaccuracies in voter lists are a common problem, leading to disenfranchisement and opportunities for manipulation. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has been working on digitizing voter rolls and linking them with Aadhaar to improve accuracy and prevent voter fraud. However, concerns about privacy and data security need to be addressed. Pilot projects in states like Andhra Pradesh have shown promise in reducing duplicate entries.", "normalised": "Another critical area is electoral roll management.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, reforms addressing criminalization of politics are vital. Candidates with criminal records often contest elections, undermining the credibility of the democratic process. Speedy trials and disqualification of convicted criminals are essential steps. The Supreme Court has repeatedly urged Parliament to enact stricter laws in this regard. Implementing recommendations from committees like the Vohra Committee is also crucial.", "normalised": "Furthermore, reforms addressing criminalization of politics are vital.

{"unnormalised": "The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) needs strengthening. While it provides a framework for ethical campaigning, its enforcement remains a challenge. Giving the ECI more powers to enforce the MCC and penalize violations would enhance its effectiveness.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, reforms related to electronic voting machines (EVMs) are frequently debated. While EVMs have generally improved efficiency and reduced booth capturing, concerns about their security and reliability persist. Independent audits, voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs), and public awareness campaigns are essential to maintain public trust in the technology. Polling booths covering an area of 1000 sq ft each, situated ideally with 2 km radius from villages, should be prioritized.", "normalised": "Moreover, reforms related to electronic voting machines (E V M s) are frequently debated.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, promoting voter education and awareness is paramount. Many voters, particularly in rural areas, lack adequate understanding of the electoral process. The ECI, along with NGOs like the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), conduct voter awareness programs to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities. More intensive and targeted programs are needed to reach all segments of the population. Encouraging participation of marginalized communities, including Dalits and Adivasis, requires special attention. The principles of Sarvodaya, championed by Mahatma Gandhi, should guide these efforts, ensuring that the welfare of all, especially the weakest, is prioritized.", "normalised": "Finally, promoting voter education and awareness is paramount.
