{"unnormalised": "One of the primary areas of focus is tackling electoral fraud and criminalization of politics. The Election Commission of India (ECI), under the guidance of successive Chief Election Commissioners like Dr. S.Y. Quraishi, has taken significant steps such as mandatory disclosure of criminal records by candidates. The demand for stricter laws to bar individuals with serious criminal charges from contesting elections is persistent. The recommendations of committees like the Dinesh Goswami Committee have been instrumental in shaping policy discussions in this area.", "normalised": "One of the primary areas of focus is tackling electoral fraud and criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant reform involves campaign finance. There's a growing need for greater transparency in political funding. The current system allows for opacity, which can lead to undue influence by corporations and individuals. Suggestions include state funding of elections to level the playing field for all parties, irrespective of their financial strength. Debates continue about the impact of electoral bonds and their contribution to transparency, or lack thereof. Parties often spend substantial sums, sometimes running into crores of Rs., on rallies and advertisements.", "normalised": "Another significant reform involves campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Voter registration and awareness are also vital components. The ECI conducts regular voter registration drives, particularly targeting first-time voters and marginalized communities. Initiatives like Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) program aim to increase voter turnout. However, challenges remain in ensuring universal adult franchise, particularly for migrant workers and those living in remote areas like the northeastern states. Simplifying the voter registration process and utilizing technology are key to addressing these challenges. For example, many Gram Panchayats organize special camps, sometimes covering areas as large as 500 sq km, to facilitate voter registration.", "normalised": "Voter registration and awareness are also vital components.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms often touch upon the use of technology. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have been implemented nationwide to reduce paper wastage and speed up the counting process. The debate around EVM security and the introduction of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) continues. Some political parties, such as the DMK, have raised concerns and called for a return to ballot papers, citing doubts about EVM integrity.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms often touch upon the use of technology.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond these, reforms related to internal democracy within political parties are often discussed. Making parties more transparent and accountable in their functioning is seen as essential for promoting democratic values within the political system itself.

They require a continuous dialogue between the ECI, political parties, civil society organizations, and citizens to strengthen Indian democracy and ensure that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the election results.", "normalised": "Ultimately, electoral reforms are an ongoing process.
