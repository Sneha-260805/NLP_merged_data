{"unnormalised": "Electoral reforms are a crucial aspect of public policy and governance, particularly in a vibrant democracy like India. These reforms aim to improve the integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness of the electoral process, thereby bolstering public trust and ensuring fair representation. The need for such reforms arises from various challenges, including electoral malpractices, the influence of money and muscle power, and the under-representation of certain segments of the population.", "normalised": "Electoral reforms are a crucial aspect of public policy and governance, particularly in a vibrant democracy like India.

{"unnormalised": "One significant area of focus is curbing electoral malpractices. Initiatives such as the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) have been implemented to enhance transparency and voter confidence. However, concerns regarding EVM security persist, demanding further research and technological advancements. Proposals like mandatory biometric authentication of voters are often debated, weighing the benefits against potential privacy concerns and logistical challenges.", "normalised": "One significant area of focus is curbing electoral malpractices.

{"unnormalised": "The influence of money in elections is another pressing issue. Candidates often spend exorbitant amounts, far exceeding the permissible limits stipulated by the Election Commission of India (ECI). Stricter regulations on campaign finance, including enhanced monitoring of donations and expenditure, are vital. Political parties also need to be brought under the ambit of Right to Information (RTI) to promote transparency in their financial dealings. The funding of elections through state funding is a contentious topic with proponents arguing it reduces dependence on corporate donations, while opponents worry about misuse of public funds.", "normalised": "The influence of money in elections is another pressing issue.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing criminalization in politics is equally important. The presence of individuals with criminal records in the electoral arena undermines the credibility of the system. Fast-tracking cases against politicians and stricter enforcement of laws that disqualify individuals convicted of serious offenses are crucial. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has played a pivotal role in bringing this issue to the forefront through its research and advocacy.", "normalised": "Addressing criminalization in politics is equally important.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms must also address the issue of representation. Ensuring fair representation for women and marginalized communities is essential for building a truly inclusive democracy. Reservation of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, a long-pending demand, remains a significant challenge. Delimitation exercises, conducted periodically based on population changes, also play a crucial role in ensuring equitable representation across different constituencies. One must consider the practical impacts of expanding reserved constituencies, and its affect on general seats.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms must also address the issue of representation.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Rajesh Sharma, a renowned expert on electoral systems at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), emphasizes the need for continuous evaluation and adaptation of electoral processes. “Electoral reforms are not a one-time fix but an ongoing process,” he states. \"For instance, the rising cost of campaigning, sometimes exceeding Rs. 100 Crores for a Lok Sabha seat spread over 500 sq km, creates an uneven playing field.\" He also suggests exploring innovative solutions like online voting, particularly for NRIs, while acknowledging the technological and security challenges involved. Ultimately, the success of electoral reforms hinges on the collective commitment of political parties, civil society organizations, and citizens to uphold the values of democracy and ensure a level playing field for all.", "normalised": "Doctor Rajesh Sharma, a renowned expert on electoral systems at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (I I P A), emphasizes the need for continuous evaluation and adaptation of electoral processes. “Electoral reforms are not a one-time fix but an ongoing process,” he states. \"For instance, the rising cost of campaigning, sometimes exceeding rupees one hundred crore for a Lok Sabha seat spread over five hundred square kilometer, creates an uneven playing field.\" He also suggests exploring innovative solutions like online voting, particularly for N R I s, while acknowledging the technological and security challenges involved.
