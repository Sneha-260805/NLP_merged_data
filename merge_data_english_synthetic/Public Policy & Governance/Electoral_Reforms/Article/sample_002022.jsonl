{"unnormalised": "One pressing issue is the criminalization of politics. Despite efforts, individuals with criminal records continue to contest elections. Dr. J.M. Lyngdoh, former Chief Election Commissioner, advocated for stricter regulations to prevent this. Initiatives like mandatory declaration of assets and criminal records have been implemented, but their effectiveness is debatable. Strengthening laws to disqualify candidates facing serious charges, even before conviction, could significantly improve the quality of our elected representatives. The Representation of the People Act, 1951 needs amendments in this regard.", "normalised": "One pressing issue is the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "Another vital area is campaign finance. The current system allows for opacity in funding sources, creating opportunities for corruption and undue influence. The use of black money in elections is a serious concern. Reforms like state funding of elections, coupled with stringent regulations on private donations and mandatory disclosure of all expenditures, are necessary to level the playing field and reduce the influence of money power. The recent electoral bonds scheme, though intended to promote transparency, has faced criticism regarding its actual impact and lack of complete accountability. Rs. 20,000 is still the limit for anonymous donations, which needs to be reduced.", "normalised": "Another vital area is campaign finance.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral roll management needs improvement. Errors and omissions in voter lists can disenfranchise eligible citizens. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is working to address this through initiatives like online registration and verification, but more needs to be done to ensure that voter lists are accurate and updated regularly, especially in densely populated urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi. Linking Aadhaar with voter ID, while debated, could potentially address the issue of duplicate registrations.", "normalised": "Furthermore, electoral roll management needs improvement.

{"unnormalised": "The efficiency and integrity of electronic voting machines (EVMs) are also subjects of ongoing debate. While EVMs have largely streamlined the voting process, concerns about their susceptibility to tampering persist. Enhancing the transparency and security of EVMs through measures like voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs) is crucial to maintaining public trust in the electoral process. Independent audits and public demonstrations of EVM functionality can also contribute to building confidence.", "normalised": "The efficiency and integrity of electronic voting machines (E V M s) are also subjects of ongoing debate.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, promoting greater participation of marginalized communities, including women, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs), is essential. While reservations exist for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, more needs to be done to encourage greater female representation in politics. Political parties need to be incentivized to nominate more women candidates. Furthermore, awareness campaigns targeted at marginalized communities can help increase their participation in the electoral process. Ensuring easy accessibility of polling booths, even in remote areas like Bastar, Chhattisgarh, is crucial. Even a 100 sq ft area can make a difference. Electoral reform is an ongoing process that requires constant evaluation and adaptation to the evolving needs of Indian society.", "normalised": "Finally, promoting greater participation of marginalized communities, including women, Scheduled Castes (S C s), and Scheduled Tribes (S T s), is essential.
