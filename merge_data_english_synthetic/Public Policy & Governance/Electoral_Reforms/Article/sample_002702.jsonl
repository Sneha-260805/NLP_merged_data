{"unnormalised": "One persistent concern is the influence of money power in elections. Candidates often spend exorbitant amounts exceeding the permissible limits set by the Election Commission of India (ECI), creating an uneven playing field and disadvantaging candidates with limited financial resources. Stricter enforcement of expenditure limits and greater transparency in political funding, including mandatory disclosure of sources contributing Rs. 20,000 or more, are crucial. State funding of elections, while a debated topic, merits serious consideration as a potential solution to curb illegal funding.", "normalised": "One persistent concern is the influence of money power in elections.

{"unnormalised": "The criminalization of politics remains a major impediment to good governance. Persons with criminal records, even those facing serious charges, are often able to contest elections. Expediting judicial proceedings against politicians accused of crimes and disqualifying convicted individuals from contesting elections for a longer period are necessary steps. The Lily Thomas case verdict (2013) was a landmark in this regard, but its full implementation requires further legislative action.", "normalised": "The criminalization of politics remains a major impediment to good governance.

{"unnormalised": "Voter apathy, particularly among urban populations, needs to be addressed through sustained voter awareness campaigns. Innovative methods like utilizing social media and partnering with NGOs can improve voter turnout. Streamlining the voter registration process and exploring options like online voting (with necessary safeguards to prevent fraud) could also encourage greater participation. During Onam, the Election Commission could leverage local cultural events to promote voter awareness among Malayali communities.", "normalised": "Voter apathy, particularly among urban populations, needs to be addressed through sustained voter awareness campaigns.

{"unnormalised": "Internal democracy within political parties is another area needing attention. Ensuring fair and transparent internal elections within parties will promote accountability and prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals. The ECI could consider prescribing guidelines for party constitutions and internal election processes.", "normalised": "Internal democracy within political parties is another area needing attention.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the integrity of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) is often questioned. Strengthening the security features of EVMs and promoting greater transparency in their functioning, including wider use of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), can enhance public trust in the electoral process. A nationwide awareness campaign, similar to the one promoting pulse polio immunization, educating citizens about the EVM voting process, can go a long way in mitigating apprehensions. These reforms, implemented diligently, can further fortify India's democratic framework and ensure that the voice of the people truly reflects in the corridors of power, guaranteeing a 'biryani' (representative & flavorful) democracy for all.", "normalised": "Finally, the integrity of Electronic Voting Machines (E V Ms) is often questioned.
