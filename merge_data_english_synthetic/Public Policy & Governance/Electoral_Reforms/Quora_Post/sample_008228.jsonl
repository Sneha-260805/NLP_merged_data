{"unnormalised": "Several key areas deserve attention. Campaign finance regulations need a serious overhaul. The current system allows for opacity, raising concerns about undue influence of money power. Introducing stricter limits, mandating disclosure of donors, and potentially exploring state funding of elections could level the playing field. Think of it – a common chaiwala shouldn't be disadvantaged against a wealthy industrialist contesting elections.", "normalised": "Several key areas deserve attention.
