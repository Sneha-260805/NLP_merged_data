{"unnormalised": "First, **campaign finance reform** is paramount. Currently, there's a huge opacity around who funds political parties. Imagine, someone donating Rs. 50 Cr. – who is it and what do they expect in return? We need greater transparency in donations, stricter limits on expenditure, and state funding of elections to level the playing field.", "normalised": "First, campaign finance reform is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Second, **criminalization of politics** remains a significant issue. People with pending criminal charges, even serious ones, can contest elections. The Election Commission of India (ECI) tries its best, but stricter laws and faster judicial processes are needed to prevent this. Remember that scene in \"Nayak\" where Anil Kapoor’s character confronts a corrupt politician? We need real-life heroes like that!", "normalised": "Second, criminalization of politics remains a significant issue. People with pending criminal charges, even serious ones, can contest elections.

Strengthening VVPAT implementation and increasing public awareness about the process are crucial. Organizations like the ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) have been advocating for many of these changes for years. The need of the hour is political will to implement these reforms and build a stronger, more representative democracy for all Indians.", "normalised": "Finally, let's talk about Electronic Voting Machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail.
