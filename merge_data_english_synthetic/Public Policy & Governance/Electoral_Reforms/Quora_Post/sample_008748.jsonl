{"unnormalised": "One crucial area is campaign finance. Right now, there's a real lack of transparency in where political parties are getting their money from. Donations above Rs. 20,000 need to be declared, but there are loopholes. We need stricter regulations and perhaps a National Election Fund to level the playing field and curb the influence of black money, just like in the movie *Nayak*, where Anil Kapoor fights corruption.", "normalised": "One crucial area is campaign finance.

Strengthening the integrity of EVMs and increasing voter awareness about their functionality is critical to maintaining public trust.
