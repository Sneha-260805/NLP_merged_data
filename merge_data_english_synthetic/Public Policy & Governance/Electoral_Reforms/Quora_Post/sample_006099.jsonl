{"unnormalised": "One critical area needing reform is campaign finance. Currently, there's a lack of transparency in political funding, which can lead to undue influence of money power. Introducing a comprehensive system for auditing and disclosing campaign contributions, perhaps similar to the suggestions made by the Election Commission of India in the past, is necessary.", "normalised": "One critical area needing reform is campaign finance.
