{"unnormalised": "One major area requiring attention is campaign finance. The sheer amount of money spent during elections, often opaque and unaccounted for, creates an uneven playing field, disadvantaging honest candidates with limited resources. Think about how candidates in UP splash Rs. 50 Lakhs easily on rallies. Stricter regulations on campaign donations, coupled with enhanced transparency, are essential. State funding of elections, as is done in some European nations, could also be considered.", "normalised": "one major area requiring attention is campaign finance the sheer amount of money spent during elections often opaque and unaccounted for creates an uneven playing field disadvantaging honest candidates with limited resources think about how candidates in u p splash rupees fifty lakh easily on rallies stricter regulations on campaign donations coupled with enhanced transparency are essential state funding of elections as is done in some european nations could also be considered"}
{"unnormalised": "Another key area is criminalization of politics. A significant number of MPs and MLAs in India face criminal charges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, electoral reforms should address issues like electronic voting machine (EVM) tampering concerns, the use of muscle power, and inaccurate voter rolls. Debates around proportional representation versus the current first-past-the-post system should also continue. Electoral reform is a continuous process, not a one-time event. The Law Commission of India and other relevant bodies should constantly review and recommend changes to ensure a truly representative and robust democracy for the 1.4 billion citizens of Bharat.", "normalised": "furthermore electoral reforms should address issues like electronic voting machine e v m tampering concerns the use of muscle power and inaccurate voter rolls debates around proportional representation versus the current first past the post system should also continue electoral reform is a continuous process not a one time event the law commission of india and other relevant bodies should constantly review and recommend changes to ensure a truly representative and robust democracy for the one point four billion citizens of bharat"}
