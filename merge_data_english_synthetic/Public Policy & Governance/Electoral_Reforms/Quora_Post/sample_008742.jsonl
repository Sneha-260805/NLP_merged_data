For example, stricter regulations on campaign finance, limiting expenditure, and making sure those with criminal records don't find their way into Parliament like some characters straight out of a Prakash Jha film. The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a monumental role here, working hard to enforce the Model Code of Conduct.", "normalised": "What kind of reforms are we talking about?
