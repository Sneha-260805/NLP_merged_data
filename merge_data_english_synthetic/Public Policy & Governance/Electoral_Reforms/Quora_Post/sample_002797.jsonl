Think about the common man from Patna – shouldn't they have the same access to information about election funding as a corporate giant in Mumbai? Anonymous electoral bonds, while intended to clean up the system, have arguably made things worse.", "normalised": "One key area is campaign finance. Currently, the system is opaque.

{"unnormalised": "Another challenge is the criminalization of politics. How can we ensure that candidates with serious criminal charges are not allowed to contest elections? We need stringent laws and their effective enforcement. This isn’t just about laws; it’s about changing the culture. As we saw in the movie \"Nayak\", a single day of honest governance can make a huge impact, but sustained institutional change is what truly matters.", "normalised": "Another challenge is the criminalization of politics.

{"unnormalised": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) is doing commendable work, but they need more teeth. Perhaps, greater autonomy and resources would help. Consider the implementation of measures like mandatory voter ID, stricter regulations on paid news, and stronger mechanisms to combat voter intimidation. These reforms are not just desirable; they are essential for the health of our democracy. Rs. 100 crores spent on a campaign should translate into actual service to the people, not just fleeting promises. Ultimately, a well-informed and empowered electorate is the best safeguard against electoral malpractices.", "normalised": "The Election Commission of India (E C I) is doing commendable work, but they need more teeth.
