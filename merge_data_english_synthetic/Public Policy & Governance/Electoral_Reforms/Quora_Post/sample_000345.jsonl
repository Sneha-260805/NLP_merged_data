{"unnormalised": "First, campaign finance. The current system allows for opaque funding channels, making it difficult to track the flow of money and its potential influence. We need stricter regulations on corporate donations and increased transparency, perhaps even a cap on individual campaign expenditure linked to constituency size. Imagine the impact on resource allocation if politicians spent less time fundraising and more time actually serving the people of, say, Lucknow.", "normalised": "First, campaign finance.

The Election Commission of India has made efforts, but we need faster judicial processes and stricter disqualification rules.

The National Voter's Service Portal is a good start, but we need more aggressive outreach programmes. Think street plays, using local languages, and even leveraging social media influencers.", "normalised": "Third, Voter awareness and participation.
