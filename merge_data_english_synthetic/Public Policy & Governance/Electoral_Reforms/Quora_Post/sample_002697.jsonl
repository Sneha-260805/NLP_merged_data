{"unnormalised": "One key area is campaign finance. Currently, there are limits to individual contributions, but corporate funding is often murky. Think about the complexities highlighted in films like \"Youngistaan,\" which touches on the pressures faced by political figures.

While EVMs have generally been reliable, concerns regarding hacking and manipulation persist. Strengthening the VVPAT system and increasing public trust through audits are essential steps. Perhaps random checks covering 5% of booths, instead of the current lower percentage, can build more confidence. These are just some aspects where electoral reforms can help ensure free and fair elections, and ultimately, a stronger democracy for all Indians.", "normalised": "Finally, reforms related to electronic voting machines and voter-verifiable paper audit trails are often debated.
