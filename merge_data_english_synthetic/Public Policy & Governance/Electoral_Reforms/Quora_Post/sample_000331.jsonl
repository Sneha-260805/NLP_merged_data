Increased transparency, stricter limits on corporate donations (perhaps through a public funding model similar to some European nations), and enhanced scrutiny of expenditure are vital. Imagine a scenario where parties are largely funded by small individual donations rather than anonymous big money – the power dynamics would shift considerably.", "normalised": "One area ripe for reform is campaign finance.
