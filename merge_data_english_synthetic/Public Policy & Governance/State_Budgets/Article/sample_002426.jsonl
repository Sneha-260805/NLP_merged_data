{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India are vital instruments for public policy and governance, serving as comprehensive financial blueprints that outline a state government's proposed revenues and expenditures for a fiscal year (April 1st to March 31st).

{"unnormalised": "The process begins with the Finance Department of each state preparing estimates of revenue and expenditure. These estimates are then debated and scrutinized within the state legislative assembly. Following extensive discussions and potential amendments, the budget is passed, becoming the legal authorization for the government to spend public funds. Key components of a state budget include revenue receipts (tax and non-tax revenue), capital receipts (borrowings and recovery of loans), revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of government), and capital expenditure (investment in infrastructure like roads, irrigation projects, and hospitals).", "normalised": "The process begins with the Finance Department of each state preparing estimates of revenue and expenditure.

Its budget might prioritize areas such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, reflecting the state's long-standing commitment to human development. A significant allocation could be made for the upcoming Onam celebrations, including subsidies on essential goods and support for cultural events. Alternatively, a state like Uttar Pradesh, with its vast agricultural base, might focus on irrigation projects, rural infrastructure, and support for farmers through schemes like PM-KISAN.", "normalised": "Consider a state like Kerala.

{"unnormalised": "The Economic Survey, presented before the budget, provides a crucial backdrop, highlighting the state's economic performance in the preceding year. It analyzes trends in key sectors like agriculture, industry, and services, along with indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and employment. This analysis informs budget allocations and policy decisions. For example, a state facing a drought might allocate significant funds towards drought relief measures, including providing clean drinking water and supporting affected farmers.", "normalised": "The Economic Survey, presented before the budget, provides a crucial backdrop, highlighting the state's economic performance in the preceding year.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of state budgets is far-reaching. They determine the quality of public services, influence economic growth, and shape social outcomes. Infrastructure projects funded through the budget, such as the construction of a new bridge connecting two regions or upgrading a local railway station, can have significant economic and social benefits. Similarly, investments in education, like building new schools or hiring more teachers, can improve literacy rates and enhance human capital. The efficient allocation and implementation of budgeted funds are critical for achieving desired outcomes. Mismanagement or corruption can undermine the budget's effectiveness and hinder development.", "normalised": "The impact of state budgets is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "For instance, imagine a state government allocating Rs. 500 crore for upgrading rural healthcare infrastructure. If the funds are utilized effectively, it could lead to the construction of new primary health centers, procurement of essential medical equipment, and training of healthcare professionals, ultimately improving access to quality healthcare in rural areas. Conversely, if a significant portion of the funds is siphoned off through corrupt practices, the impact on rural healthcare would be minimal, despite the substantial allocation.", "normalised": "For instance, imagine a state government allocating rupee five hundred crore for upgrading rural healthcare infrastructure.
