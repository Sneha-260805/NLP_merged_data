{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India represent the financial blueprints that guide the socio-economic development of individual states within the Indian Union. As integral components of India's fiscal federalism, these budgets outline the planned revenue and expenditure for a given financial year, reflecting the priorities and policy objectives of the state government. Understanding the nuances of state budgets is crucial for assessing the overall health of the Indian economy and the effectiveness of governance at the sub-national level.", "normalised": "State budgets in India represent the financial blueprints that guide the socio-economic development of individual states within the Indian Union.

{"unnormalised": "The preparation of a state budget is a comprehensive process involving various departments and agencies. The Finance Department, typically headed by the Finance Minister, spearheads the exercise. Departments submit their projected expenditure needs, which are then scrutinized and prioritized based on available resources and policy directives. Revenue projections, derived from sources such as state taxes, share of central taxes as per the recommendations of the Finance Commission, and grants-in-aid, are equally critical.", "normalised": "The preparation of a state budget is a comprehensive process involving various departments and agencies.

{"unnormalised": "Key components of a state budget include revenue expenditure, which covers day-to-day operational expenses like salaries, pensions, and maintenance of infrastructure; and capital expenditure, which focuses on creating long-term assets such as roads, hospitals, and irrigation projects. The budget also outlines various social welfare schemes targeted at specific segments of the population. For example, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) requires significant budgetary allocation from state governments.", "normalised": "Key components of a state budget include revenue expenditure, which covers day-to-day operational expenses like salaries, pensions, and maintenance of infrastructure; and capital expenditure, which focuses on creating long-term assets such as roads, hospitals, and irrigation projects.

{"unnormalised": "Recent state budgets have increasingly focused on key areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. States like Tamil Nadu have prioritized schemes like the 'Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai Thittam', allocating substantial funds for women's empowerment. Similarly, Maharashtra has allocated Rs. 1,50,000 crores towards infrastructure projects, including the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway (Samruddhi Mahamarg). Initiatives like the 'Mission Bhagiratha' in Telangana, aimed at providing safe drinking water to every household, demonstrate the commitment to improving public health through budgetary provisions.", "normalised": "Recent state budgets have increasingly focused on key areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.

{"unnormalised": "However, state budgets also face several challenges. Fiscal deficits, stemming from revenue shortfalls or excessive spending, can constrain developmental activities. States often rely heavily on central government transfers, making them vulnerable to changes in central policies. Effective implementation of budgetary allocations is another persistent challenge, with delays and leakages hindering the intended impact.", "normalised": "However, state budgets also face several challenges.
