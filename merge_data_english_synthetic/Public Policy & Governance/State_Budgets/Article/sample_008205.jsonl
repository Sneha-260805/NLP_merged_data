{"unnormalised": "The process of crafting a state budget begins well in advance, typically involving extensive consultations between various departments, ministries, and stakeholders. Each department submits its expenditure proposals, which are then scrutinized by the finance department. The finance minister, much like Nirmala Sitharaman at the Union level, plays a pivotal role in consolidating these proposals, projecting revenue, and presenting the final budget to the state legislature.", "normalised": "The process of crafting a state budget begins well in advance, typically involving extensive consultations between various departments, ministries, and stakeholders.

{"unnormalised": "A key component of any state budget is revenue generation. States rely on a combination of their own tax revenues (like State Goods and Services Tax - SGST), non-tax revenues (royalties from minerals, fees, etc.), and transfers from the central government based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Understanding this revenue mix is critical for assessing a state's fiscal autonomy and its ability to fund its developmental agenda.", "normalised": "A key component of any state budget is revenue generation.

{"unnormalised": "The expenditure side of the budget reveals the government's priorities. Allocations are made across various sectors, including education, healthcare, agriculture, infrastructure (roads, railways, power), social welfare, and law and order. For example, Uttar Pradesh might allocate significant resources to improving irrigation infrastructure to support its large agricultural population, while Kerala might prioritize healthcare and education. Recently, there's been increasing emphasis on sustainable development and green initiatives, with states like Karnataka allocating funds for renewable energy projects.", "normalised": "The expenditure side of the budget reveals the government's priorities.

For instance, a state might allocate Rs. 500 crore for a housing scheme for the economically weaker sections or Rs. 200 crore for improving rural connectivity under a program akin to PMGSY. These specific allocations provide insight into the government's commitment to addressing particular socio-economic challenges.", "normalised": "The budget also includes provisions for flagship schemes.

{"unnormalised": "The budget session in the state legislature is a crucial period of debate and scrutiny. Opposition parties often dissect the budget, questioning the allocation of resources and proposing alternative policies. The Chief Minister and his cabinet must defend their proposals and address concerns raised by legislators.", "normalised": "The budget session in the state legislature is a crucial period of debate and scrutiny.

For instance, special allocations might be made for celebrating Onam in Kerala, or for ensuring the availability of subsidized rations for the underprivileged across the state, ensuring that even staples like biryani ingredients are accessible to all. Ultimately, state budgets are not just financial documents; they are reflections of a state's aspirations, priorities, and commitment to its citizens.", "normalised": "Beyond the numbers, state budgets reflect the cultural and social fabric of the region.
