{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India are critical instruments for implementing public policy and achieving developmental goals at the sub-national level. Governed by Article 202 of the Constitution, these annual financial statements outline the projected revenues and expenditures of each state government for the upcoming fiscal year, typically running from April 1st to March 31st. The process involves extensive consultations between various departments, finance ministries, and ultimately, the state legislature.", "normalised": "State budgets in India are critical instruments for implementing public policy and achieving developmental goals at the sub-national level.

{"unnormalised": "The budgeting process starts with forecasting revenue, considering both state-owned sources (such as sales tax, excise duty, and stamp duty) and transfers from the central government, as recommended by the Finance Commission. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has significantly impacted state revenue structures, necessitating a reliance on GST compensation mechanisms, at least until recently. The allocation of funds is heavily influenced by the state’s socio-economic priorities, often reflecting commitments made in election manifestos and broader developmental plans.", "normalised": "The budgeting process starts with forecasting revenue, considering both state-owned sources (such as sales tax, excise duty, and stamp duty) and transfers from the central government, as recommended by the Finance Commission.

{"unnormalised": "Expenditure is typically categorized into revenue expenditure (covering day-to-day operational costs, salaries, and subsidies) and capital expenditure (investments in infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and irrigation systems). States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu allocate significant portions of their budgets to infrastructure development, aiming to boost economic growth and improve connectivity. For instance, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link project, costing Rs. 17,843 crore, received substantial budgetary support from the Maharashtra government. Social sector schemes, like the Dr. YSR Arogyasri Health Insurance scheme in Andhra Pradesh, also command a considerable share of state budgets, reflecting the commitment to welfare programs.", "normalised": "Expenditure is typically categorized into revenue expenditure (covering day-to-day operational costs, salaries, and subsidies) and capital expenditure (investments in infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and irrigation systems).

{"unnormalised": "Scrutiny of state budgets is primarily undertaken by the state legislature through various committees, including the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee. They examine the budget proposals, raise concerns, and provide recommendations for modifications. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) plays a vital role by auditing state government accounts and highlighting instances of inefficiency, corruption, or deviation from approved budgetary allocations.", "normalised": "Scrutiny of state budgets is primarily undertaken by the state legislature through various committees, including the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee.

{"unnormalised": "The size of state budgets varies significantly, with larger states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh having considerably larger budgets than smaller states like Goa or Sikkim. The allocation for specific sectors can also differ drastically based on regional needs and priorities. For example, a primarily agrarian state like Punjab might allocate a higher proportion to agricultural subsidies and irrigation projects, compared to a state with a dominant service sector like Karnataka. Furthermore, the implementation of centrally sponsored schemes, like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), relies heavily on effective budgetary allocation and utilization at the state level.", "normalised": "The size of state budgets varies significantly, with larger states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh having considerably larger budgets than smaller states like Goa or Sikkim.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges in state budgeting include managing fiscal deficits, optimizing resource mobilization, and ensuring efficient implementation of schemes. Many states grapple with issues of revenue leakage, underutilization of funds, and delays in project execution. For example, acquiring land for infrastructure projects in West Bengal often faces hurdles, leading to cost overruns and delays. Addressing these challenges requires enhanced transparency, improved governance, and greater citizen participation in the budgetary process. A recent initiative in Kerala promoted citizen budgeting, allowing residents to influence local development plans and allocations for areas as small as 500 sq ft plots.", "normalised": "Challenges in state budgeting include managing fiscal deficits, optimizing resource mobilization, and ensuring efficient implementation of schemes.
