{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India represent a crucial instrument for translating policy priorities into tangible action, reflecting the unique socio-economic landscapes and developmental aspirations of each state. These annual financial statements, presented by the respective State Finance Ministers, detail the estimated receipts and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year, shaping the contours of governance at the sub-national level. They are more than just accounting exercises; they are powerful statements about the direction a state intends to take.", "normalised": "State budgets in India represent a crucial instrument for translating policy priorities into tangible action, reflecting the unique socio-economic landscapes and developmental aspirations of each state.

{"unnormalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex process, starting with estimations from various departments regarding their resource needs. These are vetted and consolidated by the Finance Department, which also factors in anticipated revenue projections, including State Goods and Services Tax (SGST), share in central taxes, and other forms of revenue generation. The process is guided by principles of fiscal responsibility and sustainability, though political considerations inevitably play a significant role, particularly in the run-up to elections.", "normalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex process, starting with estimations from various departments regarding their resource needs.

{"unnormalised": "A key challenge for many states is managing their fiscal deficit. While adhering to Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act targets is desirable, states often grapple with competing demands: investing in infrastructure like roads (e.g., a 200 km highway project in Uttar Pradesh), funding social welfare schemes (e.g., Dr. Ambedkar Awas Yojana in Maharashtra), and maintaining administrative efficiency. Balancing these necessitates careful prioritization and resource allocation.", "normalised": "A key challenge for many states is managing their fiscal deficit.

Similarly, the Tamil Nadu budget often prioritizes initiatives related to healthcare and education, reflecting the state's commitment to social development. In contrast, a state like Bihar, grappling with unique developmental challenges, might focus on rural development and agriculture, allocating resources to irrigation projects and farmer support programs.", "normalised": "For instance, the Karnataka state budget typically allocates significant funds towards Bengaluru's infrastructure development, including projects aimed at easing traffic congestion and improving public transportation.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of state budgets extends beyond direct government spending. They influence private investment decisions, consumer confidence, and overall economic activity within the state. Consider a Rs. 500 crore investment in building affordable housing – this not only provides shelter but also stimulates demand for construction materials, creates employment opportunities (e.g., for labourers earning Rs. 300/day), and can boost the local economy by creating opportunities for businesses such as shops in the planned new residential area (measuring say 1000 sq ft).", "normalised": "The impact of state budgets extends beyond direct government spending.
