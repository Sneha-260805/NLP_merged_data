{"unnormalised": "The preparation of a state budget typically involves a complex process, starting with consultations across various government departments. Each department submits its proposed spending requirements for the upcoming year, justifying these demands with evidence of past performance and future needs. The Finance Department, headed by the Finance Minister, then consolidates these proposals, assesses the state's revenue projections (through taxes, grants from the Centre, and other sources), and balances the budget to ensure that expenditures don't exceed available funds.", "normalised": "The preparation of a state budget typically involves a complex process, starting with consultations across various government departments.

{"unnormalised": "Key components of a state budget include: Revenue Receipts (tax and non-tax revenue), Capital Receipts (borrowings and disinvestment), Revenue Expenditure (salaries, pensions, subsidies), and Capital Expenditure (infrastructure projects like roads, irrigation, and hospitals). Analyzing the allocation across these categories provides insights into the government's focus on social welfare, infrastructure development, and economic growth. For instance, a significant allocation to education and healthcare signals a commitment to human capital development, while increased investment in infrastructure points towards a desire to boost economic activity.", "normalised": "Key components of a state budget include: Revenue Receipts (tax and non-tax revenue), Capital Receipts (borrowings and disinvestment), Revenue Expenditure (salaries, pensions, subsidies), and Capital Expenditure (infrastructure projects like roads, irrigation, and hospitals).

A robust allocation towards schemes like the Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme or investments in public healthcare infrastructure are common features. Or the budget of Uttar Pradesh, where substantial funds might be earmarked for improving irrigation facilities in the fertile Gangetic plains, impacting agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes. During Onam, the Kerala government often announces special provisions or subsidies as part of the state budget, adding a festive touch to the financial planning.", "normalised": "Consider, for example, the Kerala state budget, often keenly watched for its social welfare programs.

{"unnormalised": "Effective implementation of the state budget is just as important as its preparation. Transparency in procurement processes, robust monitoring mechanisms, and accountability of government officials are essential to ensure that funds are used efficiently and effectively. Leakages, corruption, and delays in project implementation can severely undermine the impact of even the most well-intentioned budget. The CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) plays a vital role in auditing state government accounts and highlighting instances of financial irregularities or inefficiencies.", "normalised": "Effective implementation of the state budget is just as important as its preparation.

{"unnormalised": "The success of a state budget hinges on its ability to accurately reflect the state's needs, allocate resources strategically, and implement policies effectively. A well-crafted and diligently implemented budget can pave the way for sustained economic growth, improved social welfare, and enhanced quality of life for the citizens of the state. Think of the state budget as a recipe – if prepared carefully, even with simple ingredients like rice and lentils, it can transform into a delicious biryani of prosperity and well-being. For instance, Karnataka's budget in FY 2023-24 allocated Rs. 10,000 crore towards irrigation projects and Rs. 2,000 crore for rural drinking water schemes, reflecting the state's priority on water security. 3,000 km of rural roads were also proposed to be upgraded.", "normalised": "The success of a state budget hinges on its ability to accurately reflect the state's needs, allocate resources strategically, and implement policies effectively.
