{"unnormalised": "The process begins months in advance, with various departments submitting their expenditure proposals to the Finance Department. This department, often headed by a senior IAS officer, meticulously scrutinizes these requests, balancing them against the state's projected revenue. Revenue sources for states typically include state taxes like GST (State Goods and Services Tax), excise duties on alcohol and petroleum, stamp duty and registration fees, as well as grants and transfers from the central government. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, plays a vital role in recommending the distribution of these central taxes amongst the states, a process that often sparks debates between states like Tamil Nadu and Bihar concerning equitable resource allocation.", "normalised": "the process begins months in advance, with various departments submitting their expenditure proposals to the finance department. this department, often headed by a senior I A S officer, meticulously scrutinizes these requests, balancing them against the state's projected revenue. revenue sources for states typically include state taxes like G S T (state goods and services tax), excise duties on alcohol and petroleum, stamp duty and registration fees, as well as grants and transfers from the central government. the finance commission, a constitutional body, plays a vital role in recommending the distribution of these central taxes amongst the states, a process that often sparks debates between states like tamil nadu and bihar concerning equitable resource allocation."}
