They solicit input from various departments, assess the state’s economic outlook, and formulate budget proposals.

{"unnormalised": "Expenditure is categorized into revenue expenditure (salaries, pensions, subsidies) and capital expenditure (infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and irrigation projects). For instance, the Maharashtra budget for FY 2024-25 allocated a significant portion to infrastructure development, including the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway project. The budget also factors in debt servicing costs, as many states carry significant debt burdens.", "normalised": "Expenditure is categorized into revenue expenditure (salaries, pensions, subsidies) and capital expenditure (infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and irrigation projects).

{"unnormalised": "The budget's impact on governance is profound. It determines the resources available for crucial sectors such as education, healthcare, agriculture, and law and order. For example, increased allocations for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan can improve school infrastructure and teacher training, directly impacting educational outcomes. Similarly, investment in rural electrification programs can enhance agricultural productivity and improve the quality of life in villages.", "normalised": "The budget's impact on governance is profound.

{"unnormalised": "The size of a state budget can vary significantly depending on its economic size, population, and resource endowment. Uttar Pradesh, being India's most populous state, typically has one of the largest budgets. Smaller states like Sikkim have considerably smaller budgets. These budgets are vital for the implementation of various social welfare schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which provides employment to rural households. The budget also impacts the real estate sector, as funds are allocated for housing schemes and urban development, influencing property prices and construction activity, even affecting the rental yields of a 1000 sq ft apartment in Bengaluru.", "normalised": "The size of a state budget can vary significantly depending on its economic size, population, and resource endowment.

{"unnormalised": "A critical aspect of state budgets is fiscal discipline. States are expected to adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, which sets targets for fiscal deficit and debt. Prudent fiscal management ensures that states can finance their developmental needs sustainably and avoid excessive borrowing. Many state governments are implementing measures to enhance revenue mobilization and rationalize expenditure, including leveraging technology to improve tax collection and reduce leakages. Last year, the state government of Tamil Nadu announced a Rs. 20,000 crore initiative to boost renewable energy projects.", "normalised": "A critical aspect of state budgets is fiscal discipline.
