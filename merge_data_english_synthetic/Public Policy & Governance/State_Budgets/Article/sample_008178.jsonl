{"unnormalised": "A state budget is far more than just numbers; it's a statement of priorities. It reflects the government's commitment to various sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, and social welfare. For instance, a significant allocation to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in Uttar Pradesh signals a focus on improving primary education outcomes. Similarly, a large investment in road construction in Karnataka highlights the importance placed on connectivity and economic growth.", "normalised": "A state budget is far more than just numbers; it's a statement of priorities.

{"unnormalised": "The budget-making process involves several key stages. It typically begins with the state's Finance Department projecting revenue estimates based on expected tax collections (GST, state excise duties, stamp duty, etc.) and central government transfers. These projections are then used to allocate funds across different departments and schemes. Detailed proposals are prepared by each department outlining their needs and planned activities. These are then scrutinized by the Finance Department and the Planning Commission (or its equivalent at the state level) before being presented to the state cabinet for approval.", "normalised": "The budget-making process involves several key stages.

{"unnormalised": "The finalized budget is then presented to the State Legislative Assembly where it is debated and voted upon. Approval is essential for the government to have the authority to spend public funds as outlined in the budget. Following approval, the budget is implemented through various government departments and agencies. Regular monitoring and evaluation are critical to ensure funds are used efficiently and effectively, and to assess the impact of various programs.", "normalised": "The finalized budget is then presented to the State Legislative Assembly where it is debated and voted upon.

{"unnormalised": "However, state budgets are not without their challenges. One major issue is fiscal deficit – when a state's expenditures exceed its revenues. States often rely heavily on borrowing to bridge this gap, leading to increased debt burdens. Managing debt sustainably is a constant challenge for many states. Another challenge is ensuring equitable distribution of resources across different regions and communities within the state. Allocating sufficient funds to address the specific needs of marginalized communities is essential for inclusive growth.", "normalised": "However, state budgets are not without their challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Consider the allocation for the upcoming Onam festival in Kerala in the state budget, or the investments in irrigation projects in Punjab to support rice cultivation. These reflect specific regional and cultural priorities. State budgets are inherently political documents, reflecting the ruling party's ideology and priorities. They are vital tools for achieving economic development, social justice, and good governance. They are also a major ingredient to one of the most popular dishes in India - The state has to get the supplies for the Biryani. Proper management and transparent implementation of state budgets are therefore crucial for the well-being of the citizens of India.", "normalised": "Consider the allocation for the upcoming Onam festival in Kerala in the state budget, or the investments in irrigation projects in Punjab to support rice cultivation.
