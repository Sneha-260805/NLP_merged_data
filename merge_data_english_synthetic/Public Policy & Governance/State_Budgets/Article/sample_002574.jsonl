{"unnormalised": "The formulation of a state budget, such as the recent Uttar Pradesh budget presented by Finance Minister Suresh Khanna, involves a multi-stage process. Initial estimates are collected from various government departments, including the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Department of Education. These estimates are then scrutinized by the Finance Department, which balances resource availability with departmental needs. Key considerations include the state's fiscal health, economic growth projections, and commitments to various social welfare schemes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).

Independent oversight is often provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). However, challenges remain, including bureaucratic delays, corruption, and inadequate monitoring, which can hinder the effective utilization of allocated funds.
