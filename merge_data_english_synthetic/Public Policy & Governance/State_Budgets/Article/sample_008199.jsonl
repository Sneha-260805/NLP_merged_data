{"unnormalised": "The impact of state budgets is far-reaching. They influence everything from education and healthcare to infrastructure development and job creation. A well-planned budget can boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the overall quality of life for citizens. Poorly managed budgets, on the other hand, can lead to fiscal deficits, increased debt, and stalled development. Imagine a scenario where funding for a crucial rural healthcare program is slashed – the consequences for vulnerable populations could be severe. Consider also the impact of increased allocations towards skill development programs; it could potentially improve employability amongst the youth.", "normalised": "The impact of state budgets is far-reaching.
