{"unnormalised": "The process of budget formulation is a complex undertaking, involving meticulous planning, data analysis, and consultations across various departments. The state government, guided by the recommendations of the Finance Commission and its own assessments, estimates its revenue from various sources, including state taxes (like GST), share of central taxes, and grants-in-aid from the Union government. Expenditure is then allocated across diverse sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, and social welfare schemes like the MGNREGA.", "normalised": "The process of budget formulation is a complex undertaking, involving meticulous planning, data analysis, and consultations across various departments.

{"unnormalised": "A key aspect of state budgets is addressing the specific needs and priorities of the respective states. For instance, the Rajasthan state budget might focus on irrigation projects in the Thar Desert and initiatives to support rural livelihoods, while the Tamil Nadu budget could prioritize advancements in the manufacturing sector and investments in urban infrastructure like the Chennai Metro. Furthermore, states often announce new policies and programs through their budgets, such as the \"Atal Pension Yojana\" variant implemented by Maharashtra to provide social security to unorganized sector workers.", "normalised": "A key aspect of state budgets is addressing the specific needs and priorities of the respective states.

{"unnormalised": "The budgetary allocations directly influence the quality of public services available to citizens. For example, increased spending on primary healthcare in Bihar can lead to improved access to medical facilities in remote villages, while investments in higher education in Karnataka can enhance the skill sets of the youth. State budgets also play a pivotal role in infrastructure development, funding projects like the construction of new highways (e.g., the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway extension in Gujarat) and the expansion of existing transportation networks. A new airport planned in Lucknow requires approximately Rs. 2000 crore and 500 acres or 21,780,000 sq ft of land.", "normalised": "The budgetary allocations directly influence the quality of public services available to citizens.

{"unnormalised": "Accountability and transparency are paramount in the budget process. State governments are expected to present a detailed breakdown of their revenue and expenditure, enabling legislators and the public to scrutinize the allocation of funds and assess the effectiveness of government programs. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) also plays a vital role in auditing state finances and identifying any irregularities or inefficiencies.", "normalised": "Accountability and transparency are paramount in the budget process.

{"unnormalised": "The budget session often witnesses robust debates in the legislative assembly, with opposition parties questioning the government’s policies and proposing alternative solutions. Dr. Sharma, an MLA from Uttar Pradesh, might challenge the allocation for rural development, arguing for increased funding for agricultural subsidies. Ultimately, state budgets are more than just financial documents; they are reflections of the state’s development aspirations and a testament to the principles of democratic governance.", "normalised": "The budget session often witnesses robust debates in the legislative assembly, with opposition parties questioning the government’s policies and proposing alternative solutions.
