{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India form the bedrock of public policy and governance, shaping the socio-economic landscape within each of the nation's diverse regions. These annual financial statements, meticulously crafted by respective state governments, outline projected revenues, planned expenditures, and fiscal strategies for the upcoming financial year, typically running from April 1st to March 31st. The process involves extensive consultations with various departments, stakeholders, and the state legislature, culminating in a budget presentation by the Finance Minister, followed by detailed discussions and approval.", "normalised": "State budgets in India form the bedrock of public policy and governance, shaping the socio-economic landscape within each of the nation's diverse regions.

{"unnormalised": "A state budget is far more than just a list of numbers; it is a powerful instrument that drives development, addresses socio-economic disparities, and reflects the priorities of the elected government. For example, the Uttar Pradesh state budget, often one of the largest due to its significant population, typically allocates substantial funds towards agriculture, infrastructure development (roads, irrigation projects), and social welfare schemes aimed at uplifting marginalized communities. Similarly, the Kerala budget, known for its emphasis on social sectors, prioritizes healthcare, education, and initiatives promoting cooperative societies.", "normalised": "A state budget is far more than just a list of numbers; it is a powerful instrument that drives development, addresses socio-economic disparities, and reflects the priorities of the elected government.

A significant increase in budgetary allocation for education in Rajasthan, for instance, signals a commitment to improving literacy rates and enhancing the quality of education across the state. Similarly, investment in infrastructure projects like the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link (Rs. 17,843 crore) indicates a focus on boosting connectivity and economic activity in the region.", "normalised": "The allocation of funds across different sectors reveals the policy direction of the government.

States are responsible for managing their debt levels, maintaining fiscal discipline, and ensuring efficient resource allocation. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act serves as a guiding framework for responsible fiscal conduct. The state government needs to manage its finances and make decisions to prevent its budget from going into a deficit.", "normalised": "Furthermore, state budgets play a crucial role in fiscal management.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of state budgets extends beyond mere economic indicators. Investments in healthcare infrastructure, such as building primary health centers in rural areas (estimated cost of Rs. 5 lakhs per unit, covering an area of 500 sq ft), directly improve access to essential medical services for millions of citizens. Similarly, social welfare schemes, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), implemented at the state level, provide livelihood security to rural households and contribute to poverty reduction.", "normalised": "The impact of state budgets extends beyond mere economic indicators.

State budgets operationalize these principles by allocating resources to programs designed to address inequality and promote social justice. Consider Tamil Nadu's pioneering initiatives in public distribution and social security, which have been instrumental in reducing poverty and improving human development indicators.", "normalised": "Doctor Amartya Sen's work emphasizes the importance of public action and social safety nets in achieving equitable development.
