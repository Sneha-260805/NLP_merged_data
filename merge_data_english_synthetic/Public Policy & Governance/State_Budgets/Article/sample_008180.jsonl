{"unnormalised": "These budgets are annual financial statements, presented by the Finance Minister of each state, typically around the start of the fiscal year (April 1st). They outline the estimated revenues and expenditures for the upcoming year, providing a comprehensive picture of the state's financial position. Revenue sources can include state taxes (like GST, sales tax on petrol, excise duty on liquor), central government grants, and borrowing. Expenditures are categorized into various heads such as education, healthcare, infrastructure development (roads, irrigation projects), social welfare programs (pensions, food subsidies), and administrative expenses.", "normalised": "These budgets are annual financial statements, presented by the Finance Minister of each state, typically around the start of the fiscal year, April first.

{"unnormalised": "A significant portion of state budgets in India is often allocated to addressing social sector needs. For instance, the Kerala state budget may focus heavily on healthcare and education, reflecting the state's commitment to human development. Similarly, states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar may prioritize agricultural development schemes and infrastructure projects to uplift rural communities. The allocation for schemes like MGNREGA, providing guaranteed employment to rural households, is a key indicator of a state's focus on poverty alleviation.", "normalised": "A significant portion of state budgets in India is often allocated to addressing social sector needs.

{"unnormalised": "Analysis of state budgets involves looking at several key indicators: fiscal deficit (the difference between revenue and expenditure), debt-to-GSDP ratio (Gross State Domestic Product), allocation for specific sectors like education and healthcare, and the effectiveness of social welfare programs. Prudent financial management, transparent allocation of resources, and effective implementation of development schemes are critical for ensuring that state budgets contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth. For example, investment in renewable energy (solar power projects in Rajasthan) or improving rural infrastructure (rural road construction in Madhya Pradesh) are priorities for economic development. A delicious biryani, just like a well-crafted state budget, requires the right ingredients and careful preparation to truly satisfy.", "normalised": "Analysis of state budgets involves looking at several key indicators: fiscal deficit the difference between revenue and expenditure, debt to G S D P ratio Gross State Domestic Product, allocation for specific sectors like education and healthcare, and the effectiveness of social welfare programs.
