{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India represent crucial instruments of public policy, outlining the financial roadmap for individual states and reflecting their socio-economic priorities. These annual financial statements, presented before the respective Legislative Assemblies, detail projected revenues, planned expenditures, and fiscal deficits for the upcoming financial year. The process of budget formulation and implementation is a complex interplay of political considerations, economic realities, and administrative capacity.", "normalised": "State budgets in India represent crucial instruments of public policy, outlining the financial roadmap for individual states and reflecting their socio-economic priorities.

{"unnormalised": "The Constitution of India grants significant autonomy to states in managing their finances, although they operate within the overall framework of fiscal federalism. States levy taxes on various sectors, including sales tax (now subsumed under Goods and Services Tax - GST), stamp duty, and excise duty on alcohol. A significant portion of state revenue also comes from central transfers, based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission. These transfers can be either tax devolution or grants-in-aid, designed to address horizontal imbalances and promote inclusive growth across different states.", "normalised": "The Constitution of India grants significant autonomy to states in managing their finances, although they operate within the overall framework of fiscal federalism.

{"unnormalised": "The budgeting process typically involves several stages: budget formulation, legislative approval, budget execution, and audit. The Finance Department of each state government, often headed by a senior IAS officer, plays a central role in preparing the budget estimates in consultation with other departments. These estimates are then scrutinized by the legislature's finance committee before being presented to the Assembly for approval. Debates on the budget provide an opportunity for elected representatives to voice their concerns and suggest modifications.", "normalised": "The budgeting process typically involves several stages: budget formulation, legislative approval, budget execution, and audit.

{"unnormalised": "The budget documents usually encompass a detailed breakdown of expenditure across various sectors like education, healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, and social welfare. For instance, the Uttar Pradesh budget for FY 2023-24 allocated Rs. 40,000 crore for education and Rs. 25,000 crore for healthcare infrastructure. Allocations for rural development schemes like MGNREGA and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) are also crucial indicators of the government's commitment to poverty alleviation. In Maharashtra, considerable emphasis is placed on irrigation projects, with recent budgets allocating approximately Rs. 15,000 crore for completion of ongoing irrigation schemes, aiming to irrigate an additional 5000 sq ft of agricultural land.", "normalised": "The budget documents usually encompass a detailed breakdown of expenditure across various sectors like education, healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, and social welfare.

{"unnormalised": "Effective budget implementation requires efficient administrative machinery and robust monitoring mechanisms. Delays in project implementation and leakages in the system can undermine the impact of budgetary allocations. Furthermore, fiscal discipline is essential to maintain macroeconomic stability. States must manage their debt levels prudently and avoid excessive borrowing to finance current expenditures. The FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) Acts, enacted by many states, aim to promote fiscal prudence and transparency. Dr. Vijay Kelkar's committee report on fiscal consolidation provided crucial recommendations in this regard.", "normalised": "Effective budget implementation requires efficient administrative machinery and robust monitoring mechanisms.

{"unnormalised": "Transparency and accountability are paramount in the budgeting process. Making budget documents easily accessible to the public and encouraging citizen participation can enhance public trust and ensure that budgetary allocations align with the needs of the people. Initiatives like online budget portals and pre-budget consultations are steps in the right direction, fostering greater citizen engagement in governance. The upcoming Rajasthan budget is expected to focus heavily on schemes promoting women empowerment, reflecting a shift towards gender-responsive budgeting.", "normalised": "Transparency and accountability are paramount in the budgeting process.
