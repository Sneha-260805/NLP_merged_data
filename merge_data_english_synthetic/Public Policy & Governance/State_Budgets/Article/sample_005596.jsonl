{"unnormalised": "The process begins with the Finance Department of each state preparing estimates, consulting with various government departments like the Department of Education or the Department of Agriculture. These estimates reflect planned spending on diverse sectors like infrastructure development (roads, bridges), social welfare schemes (pensions, healthcare), education (schools, universities), and agriculture (irrigation projects, farmer support programs). The budget formulation process is also influenced by central government allocations and recommendations from bodies like the Finance Commission.", "normalised": "The process begins with the Finance Department of each state preparing estimates, consulting with various government departments like the Department of Education or the Department of Agriculture.

{"unnormalised": "A key component of state budgets is revenue generation. States primarily rely on taxes (e.g., State Goods and Services Tax – SGST, stamp duty, excise duty on alcohol), grants from the central government, and their own non-tax revenue (e.g., fees for services, royalties from minerals). The allocation of funds is often a political balancing act, reflecting the government's priorities and commitments to different constituencies. For instance, a state government in Kerala might prioritize investments in healthcare and education, while a government in Punjab might focus on agricultural subsidies and infrastructure.", "normalised": "A key component of state budgets is revenue generation.

{"unnormalised": "For example, in Rajasthan, the budget might allocate significant funds to address water scarcity issues in the Thar Desert, perhaps through projects like the Indira Gandhi Canal expansion. In West Bengal, the budget could focus on supporting the jute industry and providing employment opportunities in rural areas. Often, provisions are made for celebrating local festivals. During Onam in Kerala, for instance, the state budget might include special provisions for festival-related expenses and subsidies to ensure affordable prices of essential commodities for the celebrations.", "normalised": "For example, in Rajasthan, the budget might allocate significant funds to address water scarcity issues in the Thar Desert, perhaps through projects like the Indira Gandhi Canal expansion.

Let's say the Karnataka government allocates Rs. 10,000 crores to improve rural road connectivity, aiming to build or upgrade 5,000 km of roads in the next two years. This allocation, if implemented effectively, can significantly boost rural economies and improve access to markets and essential services. State budgets, like a delicious plate of biryani, are a complex mix of ingredients, but when cooked right, they can nourish the entire state.", "normalised": "Finally, consider a hypothetical budget allocation.
