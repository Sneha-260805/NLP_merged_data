{"unnormalised": "A key element of a state budget is the focus on revenue generation. States primarily raise revenue through taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), state excise duties (on items like alcohol), stamp duty and registration fees, and taxes on vehicles. A significant portion of revenue also comes from central government transfers, based on recommendations of the Finance Commission, an independent body that determines the principles governing the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and the states.", "normalised": "A key element of a state budget is the focus on revenue generation.

{"unnormalised": "Expenditure allocations in the budget reveal the government's policy priorities. A state prioritizing education might allocate a larger share of its budget to building new schools, hiring teachers, and improving educational infrastructure. Similarly, a state focused on healthcare might increase spending on hospitals, public health programs, and medical research. Infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, and irrigation projects, is another vital component of state budgets.", "normalised": "Expenditure allocations in the budget reveal the government's policy priorities.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding state budgets requires a grasp of key concepts like fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, and capital expenditure. The fiscal deficit is the difference between a state's total revenue and total expenditure. The revenue deficit focuses specifically on the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure. Capital expenditure refers to spending on assets that will provide long-term benefits, like infrastructure projects. Prudent fiscal management is essential for maintaining economic stability and promoting sustainable development. For instance, the budget of Kerala often features specific allocations for celebrating Onam, the state's harvest festival, reflecting the cultural importance of the event.", "normalised": "Understanding state budgets requires a grasp of key concepts like fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, and capital expenditure.

{"unnormalised": "Scrutiny of state budgets is vital for ensuring transparency and accountability. Citizens, civil society organizations, and the media play a crucial role in analyzing budget allocations, identifying potential areas of concern, and holding the government accountable for its spending decisions. For example, analyzing the allocation for agricultural subsidies in Punjab or examining the healthcare expenditure in Tamil Nadu provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of government programs. Preparing for festival season means thinking of the budgets of the families in all the states. Imagine the aroma of Biryani wafting through the air when the budget allows for a celebration!", "normalised": "Scrutiny of state budgets is vital for ensuring transparency and accountability.
