{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India are fundamental instruments of public policy, reflecting the priorities and commitments of state governments.

{"unnormalised": "A crucial aspect of state budgets is the distinction between revenue expenditure and capital expenditure. Revenue expenditure includes day-to-day operational costs, salaries of government employees, and subsidies. Capital expenditure, on the other hand, focuses on long-term asset creation, such as infrastructure projects, hospitals, and educational institutions. For instance, the construction of a new 500,000 sq ft hospital in Bengaluru would fall under capital expenditure. A healthy balance between these two types of expenditure is crucial for sustainable development.", "normalised": "A crucial aspect of state budgets is the distinction between revenue expenditure and capital expenditure.

{"unnormalised": "The budget’s impact extends far beyond mere numbers. It dictates the availability of funds for crucial programs like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), impacting rural livelihoods. It also determines the investment in education, health, and sanitation, thereby influencing the overall human development index of the state. Furthermore, allocations for infrastructure development, such as roads, irrigation projects, and power generation, directly influence economic growth and connectivity. The recent announcement by the Maharashtra government allocating Rs. 10,000 crore for irrigation projects in the Vidarbha region is a prime example.", "normalised": "The budget’s impact extends far beyond mere numbers.

{"unnormalised": "The fiscal health of a state, reflected in its budget, is also a key factor in attracting investment and fostering economic prosperity. States with sound fiscal management and a clear vision for development are more likely to attract private sector investment, create jobs, and improve the quality of life for their citizens. Understanding state budgets is therefore essential for anyone interested in public policy, governance, and the socio-economic development of India.", "normalised": "The fiscal health of a state, reflected in its budget, is also a key factor in attracting investment and fostering economic prosperity.
