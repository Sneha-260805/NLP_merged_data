{"unnormalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a multi-staged process. It typically begins with the Finance Department, under the leadership of the Finance Minister, forecasting revenue receipts from sources like Goods and Services Tax (GST), state excise duties, land revenue, and central government transfers. These forecasts, often informed by expert committees and econometric models, form the foundation for expenditure planning. Departments like Education, Health, Public Works Department (PWD), and Agriculture then submit their proposed budgetary requirements, justifying their needs based on policy mandates and projected service demands.", "normalised": "the formulation of a state budget is a multi staged process it typically begins with the finance department under the leadership of the finance minister forecasting revenue receipts from sources like goods and services tax G S T state excise duties land revenue and central government transfers these forecasts often informed by expert committees and econometric models form the foundation for expenditure planning departments like education health public works department P W D and agriculture then submit their proposed budgetary requirements justifying their needs based on policy mandates and projected service demands"}
{"unnormalised": "The Finance Department meticulously scrutinizes these proposals, balancing them against available resources and the overarching fiscal policy objectives of the state government. This involves hard choices, often necessitating prioritization between competing demands, such as investing in rural infrastructure versus enhancing urban amenities. For example, a budget might prioritize expanding access to primary healthcare in underserved districts, allocating Rs. 50 crores to establish new primary health centers in Vidarbha. Another area might focus on improving irrigation facilities, earmarking Rs. 200 crores for the rejuvenation of canals spanning 1000 km across the state.", "normalised": "the finance department meticulously scrutinizes these proposals balancing them against available resources and the overarching fiscal policy objectives of the state government this involves hard choices often necessitating prioritization between competing demands such as investing in rural infrastructure versus enhancing urban amenities for example a budget might prioritize expanding access to primary healthcare in underserved districts allocating rupees fifty crores to establish new primary health centers in vidarbha another area might focus on improving irrigation facilities earmarking rupees two hundred crores for the rejuvenation of canals spanning one thousand kilometer across the state"}
{"unnormalised": "Following this review, the budget document, encompassing detailed estimates of income and expenditure, is presented to the state legislature for debate and approval. The legislature, composed of elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), critically examines the proposals, holding the government accountable for its fiscal choices. Amendments and modifications can be proposed during this stage, reflecting the diverse interests of constituents and opposition parties. Once approved, the budget becomes the legal framework for government spending throughout the fiscal year, which in India runs from April 1st to March 31st.", "normalised": "following this review the budget document encompassing detailed estimates of income and expenditure is presented to the state legislature for debate and approval the legislature composed of elected members of the legislative assembly M L A s critically examines the proposals holding the government accountable for its fiscal choices amendments and modifications can be proposed during this stage reflecting the diverse interests of constituents and opposition parties once approved the budget becomes the legal framework for government spending throughout the fiscal year which in india runs from april first to march thirty first"}
{"unnormalised": "Effective implementation and monitoring are paramount for ensuring that budget allocations translate into intended outcomes. Regular audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) scrutinize government spending to detect irregularities and ensure compliance with established procedures. Moreover, citizen engagement through initiatives like social audits and participatory budgeting can enhance transparency and accountability. Consider the case of Rajasthan, where the state government is actively promoting citizen participation in budget decisions at the Panchayat level, enabling local communities to influence resource allocation for projects like building new schools or improving water supply within their area, potentially funding construction up to 5000 sq ft.", "normalised": "effective implementation and monitoring are paramount for ensuring that budget allocations translate into intended outcomes regular audits by the comptroller and auditor general of india C A G scrutinize government spending to detect irregularities and ensure compliance with established procedures moreover citizen engagement through initiatives like social audits and participatory budgeting can enhance transparency and accountability consider the case of rajasthan where the state government is actively promoting citizen participation in budget decisions at the panchayat level enabling local communities to influence resource allocation for projects like building new schools or improving water supply within their area potentially funding construction up to five thousand square feet"}

It is a sacred document which should uplift the poor, build capacity, and ensure fairness to all. The annual ritual of budget presentation, therefore, is not just about numbers; it's about shaping the destiny of millions of Indians.", "normalised": "doctor pranab mukherjee a renowned economist once stated that a good budget is not merely a statement of accounts but a testament to a government's commitment to inclusive growth it is a sacred document which should uplift the poor build capacity and ensure fairness to all the annual ritual of budget presentation therefore is not just about numbers it's about shaping the destiny of millions of indians"}
