{"unnormalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex and multifaceted process. It typically begins several months before the start of the fiscal year (April 1st to March 31st) with various departments submitting their budgetary proposals to the Finance Department. The Finance Minister, often in consultation with the Chief Minister and other key cabinet members, then synthesizes these demands, considers revenue projections, and crafts a comprehensive budget proposal. This proposal undergoes rigorous scrutiny by the state legislature, including detailed discussions, debates, and potential amendments, before being passed into law.", "normalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex and multifaceted process.

{"unnormalised": "A significant portion of state budgets is allocated to key sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure development (roads, irrigation, power), and social welfare programs. For instance, the Rajasthan government's budget might prioritize initiatives aimed at improving agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, while the Maharashtra budget may focus on bolstering its industrial sector and urban infrastructure. The allocation for education often includes provisions for improving school infrastructure, teacher training, and scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Healthcare spending usually addresses areas like upgrading hospitals, expanding access to medical services, and implementing public health campaigns.", "normalised": "A significant portion of state budgets is allocated to key sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure development (roads, irrigation, power), and social welfare programs.

{"unnormalised": "Revenue sources for state budgets are diverse. They include the state's own tax revenue (GST, excise duties, property taxes), non-tax revenue (royalties from minerals, user charges), grants-in-aid from the Central Government as per the recommendations of the Finance Commission, and borrowings. Balancing revenue and expenditure is a constant challenge for state governments, particularly in states with limited fiscal capacity. Dr. Ravi Sharma, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), emphasizes the importance of prudent fiscal management, stating, \"States need to prioritize revenue mobilization efforts and streamline expenditure to ensure fiscal sustainability.\"", "normalised": "Revenue sources for state budgets are diverse.

{"unnormalised": "The effectiveness of a state budget is judged not only by its size (e.g., a Rs. 2,00,000 crore budget) but also by its impact on key socio-economic indicators. Are poverty levels declining? Is literacy increasing? Is access to clean water and sanitation improving? Are new industries being established, creating employment opportunities? For example, allocating Rs. 500 crore for constructing affordable housing units of 500 sq ft each in Mumbai may aim to alleviate housing shortages and improve living conditions. Similarly, investing in 1000 km of new rural roads in Bihar can improve connectivity and boost agricultural trade. Accountability and transparency are crucial aspects of budget implementation. Public access to budget documents and mechanisms for citizen participation are essential for ensuring that public funds are used effectively and efficiently. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) plays a vital role in auditing state government finances and highlighting any irregularities or inefficiencies.", "normalised": "The effectiveness of a state budget is judged not only by its size (e.g., a rupee two hundred billion budget) but also by its impact on key socio-economic indicators.
