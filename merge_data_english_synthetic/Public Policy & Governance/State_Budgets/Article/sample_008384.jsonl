{"unnormalised": "The process of formulating a state budget typically begins several months in advance, involving consultations between various government departments, the Finance Department, and the Chief Minister's office. Dr. Sharma, the Finance Secretary of Rajasthan, recently emphasized the importance of accurate revenue projections during a pre-budget meeting.

{"unnormalised": "Key components of a state budget include revenue receipts (tax and non-tax revenues), capital receipts (borrowings and recoveries of loans), revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of the government), and capital expenditure (investments in assets like roads, hospitals, and schools).

{"unnormalised": "A significant portion of state revenue comes from the state's own tax revenue, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), state excise duties, and stamp duty and registration fees. States also receive grants and transfers from the central government, as recommended by the Finance Commission. These transfers are crucial for states with limited fiscal capacity, enabling them to fund essential public services. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a devolution of 41% of the divisible pool of taxes to states.", "normalised": "a significant portion of state revenue comes from the state's own tax revenue, including Goods and Services Tax (G S T), state excise duties, and stamp duty and registration fees.

{"unnormalised": "The budget's impact on citizens is far-reaching. For instance, a higher allocation for healthcare in Kerala can lead to better access to medical facilities and improved public health outcomes. Similarly, investments in infrastructure, such as the construction of a 1000 km highway in Uttar Pradesh, can boost economic activity and create employment opportunities. The budget also affects businesses through tax policies and investment incentives. The recent announcement of a Rs. 5000 crore investment in industrial parks in Tamil Nadu is expected to attract significant private investment.", "normalised": "the budget's impact on citizens is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, state budgets are subject to scrutiny by the state legislature and the public. The budget must be presented, debated, and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Citizen engagement in the budget process is increasingly being encouraged through initiatives like pre-budget consultations and online feedback platforms. This ensures greater transparency and accountability in public spending. A new housing scheme promising 500 sq ft homes for the urban poor was recently a hot topic during budget discussions in the Karnataka Assembly.", "normalised": "furthermore, state budgets are subject to scrutiny by the state legislature and the public.
