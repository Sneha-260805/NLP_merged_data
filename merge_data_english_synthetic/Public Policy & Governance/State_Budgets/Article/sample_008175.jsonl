{"unnormalised": "A typical state budget comprises two main components: the Revenue Account and the Capital Account. The Revenue Account deals with the recurring receipts and expenditures of the state, such as tax revenue, grants-in-aid from the central government, salaries, and subsidies. The Capital Account, on the other hand, focuses on long-term investments like infrastructure projects, loans, and repayments. Often, debates rage about allocation to crucial sectors like education, with activists advocating for at least 6% of the state GDP to be dedicated to improving schools and colleges. Similarly, healthcare infrastructure improvements often feature prominently after unforeseen crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic exposed.", "normalised": "A typical state budget comprises two main components: the Revenue Account and the Capital Account.
