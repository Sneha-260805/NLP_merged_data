{"unnormalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex process, involving extensive consultations between various government departments, including Finance, Planning, and line ministries such as Education, Health, and Infrastructure. The Finance Minister, akin to Nirmala Sitharaman at the central level, plays a pivotal role in steering this process. Each department meticulously assesses its financial needs, aligning them with the state's development goals as enshrined in its policy documents and five-year plans. Key considerations include the projected economic growth rate, prevailing inflation, and the fiscal position of the state.", "normalised": "The formulation of a state budget is a complex process, involving extensive consultations between various government departments, including Finance, Planning, and line ministries such as Education, Health, and Infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Revenue generation forms the bedrock of any state budget. Principal sources include state taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT), now largely subsumed under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), excise duties, stamp duties, and registration fees. A significant portion of state revenue also comes from central government transfers, comprising a share of central taxes and grants-in-aid. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, or its contemporary equivalent, dictates the distribution of these funds, aiming to address inter-state disparities and promote equitable development.", "normalised": "Revenue generation forms the bedrock of any state budget.

{"unnormalised": "Expenditure proposals encompass a wide range of activities, categorized into revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of government) and capital expenditure (creation of assets). Investments in infrastructure projects, like the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), or the construction of new schools and hospitals in Uttar Pradesh, fall under capital expenditure. Allocations for social welfare schemes, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and subsidies for farmers, like those provided in Maharashtra, are classified as revenue expenditure. The budget meticulously allocates funds for salaries of government employees, ranging from IAS officers in Lucknow to teachers in rural Rajasthan, and for debt servicing.", "normalised": "Expenditure proposals encompass a wide range of activities, categorized into revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of government) and capital expenditure (creation of assets).

{"unnormalised": "A deficit budget, where expenditure exceeds revenue, is a common phenomenon. States often borrow from financial institutions, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to bridge this gap. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act places limitations on the permissible levels of borrowing, aiming to maintain fiscal discipline.", "normalised": "A deficit budget, where expenditure exceeds revenue, is a common phenomenon.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of a state budget is far-reaching. For example, an allocation of Rs. 500 crore for irrigation projects in Andhra Pradesh can significantly boost agricultural productivity. Similarly, investment in affordable housing, providing homes of approximately 500 sq ft, can uplift the living standards of marginalized communities. The effectiveness of budget implementation depends on factors such as transparency, accountability, and efficient project management. Citizen participation, through initiatives like pre-budget consultations, can enhance the relevance and responsiveness of the budget to the needs of the people. Dr. Manmohan Singh, former Prime Minister, emphasized the importance of fiscal prudence and inclusive growth in the context of state budgets. The success of India's overall development hinges on the sound management of state finances.", "normalised": "The impact of a state budget is far-reaching.
