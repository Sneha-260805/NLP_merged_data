{"unnormalised": "State budgets are crucial instruments of public policy and governance in India, acting as comprehensive financial blueprints that outline how each state intends to allocate its resources over a fiscal year. These budgets aren't just about numbers; they reflect a state government's priorities, economic vision, and commitment to its citizens' welfare. They are typically presented by the Finance Minister of the state in the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and require approval from the legislature to be enacted.", "normalised": "State budgets are crucial instruments of public policy and governance in India, acting as comprehensive financial blueprints that outline how each state intends to allocate its resources over a fiscal year.

{"unnormalised": "A well-crafted state budget serves multiple vital functions. Firstly, it enables efficient resource allocation. Funds are directed towards various sectors like education, healthcare, infrastructure (roads, bridges, irrigation projects), agriculture, social welfare schemes, and law enforcement based on identified needs and strategic goals. For example, the Karnataka state budget might allocate a significant portion to Bangalore's infrastructure development given its status as a major IT hub, while Kerala's budget might prioritize healthcare and education given its historically strong social development indicators.", "normalised": "A well-crafted state budget serves multiple vital functions.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, state budgets are key tools for economic management. They allow governments to stimulate economic growth through targeted investments, tax incentives, and job creation programs. For instance, a state government might offer tax breaks to companies setting up manufacturing units in backward regions to boost employment. The size and composition of a state's budget can significantly impact its GDP growth rate.", "normalised": "Secondly, state budgets are key tools for economic management.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, these budgets ensure accountability and transparency. The budgetary process involves extensive debate and scrutiny, allowing citizens and civil society organizations to hold the government accountable for its spending decisions. Details of the budget are usually made publicly available, enabling citizens to understand how their taxes are being used. This transparency promotes good governance and reduces the potential for corruption.", "normalised": "Thirdly, these budgets ensure accountability and transparency.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, state budgets reflect the unique socio-economic context of each state. A state like Punjab, known as the 'Granary of India,' would likely dedicate a significant portion of its budget to agriculture and irrigation. Conversely, a coastal state like Goa, with its thriving tourism industry, would prioritize investments in tourism infrastructure and environmental protection.", "normalised": "Furthermore, state budgets reflect the unique socio-economic context of each state.

{"unnormalised": "The annual budget exercise is often accompanied by a flurry of activity, with debates on issues ranging from the allocation for rural development to the feasibility of new infrastructure projects.

{"unnormalised": "The budget also incorporates cultural elements. For example, allocations may be made to support traditional crafts, promote festivals like Onam in Kerala, or preserve historical monuments. Funding may even be set aside for improving the quality of biryani served in state-run canteens, a seemingly small detail that reflects a government's responsiveness to its constituents' needs and desires.", "normalised": "The budget also incorporates cultural elements.
