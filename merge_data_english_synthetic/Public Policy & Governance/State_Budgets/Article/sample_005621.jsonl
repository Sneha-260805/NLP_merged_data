{"unnormalised": "State budgets in India represent a crucial instrument of public policy and governance, reflecting the priorities and aspirations of individual states within the framework of a federal structure. These annual financial statements, presented before the State Legislative Assemblies, detail the projected revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year (April 1st to March 31st). Understanding their intricacies is paramount for stakeholders ranging from academics and policymakers to the common citizen.", "normalised": "State budgets in India represent a crucial instrument of public policy and governance, reflecting the priorities and aspirations of individual states within the framework of a federal structure.

{"unnormalised": "The process of budget formulation typically begins months in advance, with various departments submitting their expenditure requests to the Finance Department. The Finance Minister, currently Dr. Nirmala Sitharaman at the Union level (though we are focusing on state budgets here), then oversees the process of resource allocation, balancing competing demands with the state's overall fiscal position. This involves intricate negotiations and trade-offs, often influenced by political considerations and the ruling party's manifesto promises. Consider, for instance, the allocation for infrastructure development in Maharashtra, with significant funding channeled towards the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, a project spanning several 701 km.", "normalised": "The process of budget formulation typically begins months in advance, with various departments submitting their expenditure requests to the Finance Department.

{"unnormalised": "A key component of any state budget is the revenue side. States generate revenue through various sources including their own tax collections (e.g., State Goods and Services Tax - SGST, excise duty on alcohol), non-tax revenues (e.g., royalties from mining), and grants and loans from the Central Government. The distribution of central taxes among states, as recommended by the Finance Commission, is a particularly sensitive issue, influencing inter-state fiscal equity. States like Bihar often advocate for a greater share, citing their developmental needs.", "normalised": "A key component of any state budget is the revenue side.

{"unnormalised": "On the expenditure side, budgets are categorized into revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of the government) and capital expenditure (creation of assets like roads, hospitals, and schools). Increasing capital expenditure is generally viewed favorably as it stimulates economic growth and creates employment opportunities. Initiatives like the \"Housing for All\" scheme in Tamil Nadu involve substantial investment in affordable housing projects, aiming to construct homes covering millions of sq ft.", "normalised": "On the expenditure side, budgets are categorized into revenue expenditure (day-to-day running of the government) and capital expenditure (creation of assets like roads, hospitals, and schools).

{"unnormalised": "Deviations from budgetary allocations are commonplace due to unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters or economic shocks. Supplementary budgets are often introduced to address such exigencies. Effective budget execution and monitoring are thus crucial to ensure that resources are utilized efficiently and effectively. Ultimately, a well-crafted and implemented state budget is essential for promoting inclusive growth and improving the quality of life for citizens in states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala. The fiscal deficit, typically measured as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), remains a key indicator of fiscal health, with most states aiming to keep it within the limits prescribed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.", "normalised": "Deviations from budgetary allocations are commonplace due to unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters or economic shocks.
