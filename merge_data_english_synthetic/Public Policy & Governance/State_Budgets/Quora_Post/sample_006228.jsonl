{"unnormalised": "Secondly, expenditure allocation is key. What percentage is dedicated to infrastructure (roads, irrigation – vital in states like Punjab), social sector spending (education, healthcare - think Ayushman Bharat), and debt servicing? Is the allocation aligned with the state's developmental goals and priorities laid out in the Five-Year Plans? A significant chunk going to debt servicing might indicate fiscal stress.", "normalised": "secondly, expenditure allocation is key. what percentage is dedicated to infrastructure (roads, irrigation – vital in states like punjab), social sector spending (education, healthcare - think ayushman bharat), and debt servicing? is the allocation aligned with the state's developmental goals and priorities laid out in the five-year plans? a significant chunk going to debt servicing might indicate fiscal stress."}

{"unnormalised": "Finally, scrutinize specific allocations to flagship programs. For instance, how much is earmarked for the Swachh Bharat Mission in urban areas, or for rural housing schemes? Are there tangible outcomes expected from these initiatives? Understanding these nuances allows for a more comprehensive assessment of a state budget's effectiveness. Rs. 500 Cr allocated to rural development might seem significant, but consider the area it needs to cover – perhaps 10,000 sq ft. This holistic approach is essential for evaluating the budget's efficacy and its potential impact on the lives of ordinary citizens in states from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.", "normalised": "finally, scrutinize specific allocations to flagship programs. for instance, how much is earmarked for the swachh bharat mission in urban areas, or for rural housing schemes? are there tangible outcomes expected from these initiatives? understanding these nuances allows for a more comprehensive assessment of a state budget's effectiveness. rupees five hundred crore allocated to rural development might seem significant, but consider the area it needs to cover – perhaps ten thousand square feet. this holistic approach is essential for evaluating the budget's efficacy and its potential impact on the lives of ordinary citizens in states from kashmir to kanyakumari."}
