Firstly, the revenue side, including tax revenues (G S T, state excise, sales tax) and non-tax revenues. Secondly, the expenditure side, categorizing spending across sectors like education, healthcare, infrastructure (roads, irrigation projects like the Sardar Sarovar Dam), and social welfare schemes (like the M G N R E G A). Analyzing the allocation for crucial initiatives like the National Health Mission is also vital."}

Transparency and public participation in the budget-making process are vital for good governance. For example, budget documents should be easily accessible online, allowing citizens to understand where their tax money is going, even down to the allocation for constructing a community hall spanning five thousand square feet. Doctor Patel, for instance, a renowned economist at I I M Ahmedabad, has frequently emphasized the importance of fiscal prudence in state budgets. Effective budget implementation is just as important as the budget itself."}
