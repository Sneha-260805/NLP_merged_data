{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the heavy reliance on central government transfers. Many states, particularly those in the North-East like Nagaland and Manipur, depend significantly on grants and tax revenue sharing from the Union government, limiting their fiscal autonomy and ability to respond to local needs effectively. This dependency can lead to delays in project implementation as states await funds.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the heavy reliance on central government transfers.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant hurdle is accurate revenue forecasting. States often struggle to predict tax revenues accurately, particularly from volatile sources like stamp duty and registration fees linked to real estate transactions (often quoted in Rs. per sq ft), or excise duties on alcohol. Overly optimistic forecasts can lead to budget deficits and necessitate mid-year expenditure cuts, disrupting planned programs.", "normalised": "Another significant hurdle is accurate revenue forecasting.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, political pressures and populist schemes frequently distort budgetary allocations. Dr. Sharma's committee report highlighted the tendency to announce unviable projects or subsidies to gain electoral favour, compromising fiscal prudence. For example, schemes like free electricity or loan waivers, while politically appealing, can strain state finances considerably.", "normalised": "Furthermore, political pressures and populist schemes frequently distort budgetary allocations.

{"unnormalised": "Capacity constraints within state government departments are also a challenge. Lack of skilled personnel in areas like financial management and project monitoring can hinder efficient budget execution. The implementation of GST has added another layer of complexity, requiring states to adapt their taxation systems and build capacity to administer the new regime effectively. Data collection and analysis also need improvement for better-informed decision-making. The state of Maharashtra, for example, has struggled with accurately accounting for agricultural output, impacting budget allocations for the sector.", "normalised": "Capacity constraints within state government departments are also a challenge.
