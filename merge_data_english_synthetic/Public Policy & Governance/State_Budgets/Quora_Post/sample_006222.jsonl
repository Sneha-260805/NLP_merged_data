{"unnormalised": "A well-structured state budget allows for efficient resource allocation, ensuring that funds are channeled towards priority areas that directly benefit the citizens. For instance, increased budgetary allocation for primary healthcare in Bihar could improve access to medical services in rural areas. Similarly, investments in infrastructure projects like road construction (Rs. 500 crores for 1000 km) in Rajasthan can significantly boost connectivity and economic activity.", "normalised": "A well-structured state budget allows for efficient resource allocation, ensuring that funds are channeled towards priority areas that directly benefit the citizens.

Maharashtra, with its diverse economy and geography, needs tailored approaches for different regions to ensure equitable development. The MGNREGA scheme often receives significant budgetary support to provide employment in rural areas. Scrutiny of budget documents, including supplementary budgets and performance indicators, is vital for holding governments accountable. Transparency initiatives, like making budget documents readily available online in multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi, Telugu), are crucial for citizen participation and oversight. A new secretariat of 2000 sq ft will aid the finance ministry. Effectively managed state budgets are the bedrock of a prosperous and equitable India.", "normalised": "Furthermore, state budgets must address regional disparities.
