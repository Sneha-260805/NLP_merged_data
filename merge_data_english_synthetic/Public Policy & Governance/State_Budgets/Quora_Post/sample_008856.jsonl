Factors such as the state's economic growth, central government allocations, and prevailing socio-economic conditions significantly influence budget allocations. For instance, a state like Maharashtra, with its substantial industrial base, might allocate a significant portion to infrastructure development, say rupees fifty thousand crore for new roads spanning two thousand kilometer, or investments in improving Mumbai's urban landscape. A predominantly agricultural state like Bihar, however, might prioritize irrigation projects and agricultural subsidies, possibly including schemes benefiting small farmers on less than one acre (forty three thousand five hundred and sixty square feet)."}
