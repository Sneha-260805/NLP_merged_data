Are there mechanisms in place to prevent leakages and ensure that funds reach the intended beneficiaries? For instance, are public works projects being completed within budget and on time, or are there cost overruns and delays as often seen in road construction spanning kilometers in Uttar Pradesh? Scrutinizing audit reports from institutions like the CAG is crucial here.", "normalised": "Finally, consider the efficiency of expenditure. Are existing programs being implemented effectively?

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Arun Sharma, a professor at IIM Lucknow, often emphasizes that understanding the assumptions and trade-offs inherent in budget making is essential. Ultimately, a well-crafted state budget can unlock significant development potential, creating jobs, improving living standards, and fostering inclusive growth. For instance, consider the impact of a Rs. 500 crore investment in building affordable housing complexes in Mumbai, providing homes to thousands currently living in slums with areas as small as 200 sq ft.", "normalised": "Doctor Arun Sharma, a professor at I I M Lucknow, often emphasizes that understanding the assumptions and trade-offs inherent in budget making is essential.
