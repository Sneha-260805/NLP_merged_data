Often, these grants come with specific requirements that can impact the state's flexibility in resource allocation. Analyzing these will allow for a detailed view of budget utilization in sq ft areas. The allocation in Rs. 5,000 Cr schemes should be cross-verified. Analyzing State Budgets provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of public policy in India.", "normalised": "Finally, Doctor Sharma, a former Professor at I I M Ahmedabad, always emphasized the importance of analyzing conditionalities attached to central grants.
