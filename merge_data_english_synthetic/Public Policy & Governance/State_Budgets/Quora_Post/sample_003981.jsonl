Overly optimistic projections often lead to revised estimates and delayed project implementation. For instance, projecting fifteen percent growth in excise revenue is ambitious, especially considering changing consumption patterns."}

How many state budgets explicitly allocate resources towards combating climate change, promoting sustainable agriculture, or protecting ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Western Ghats covering states from Gujarat to Kerala? Allocating rupee twenty five lakhs for a tree planting drive for an area of ten thousand square feet is a good start, but needs significant scaling."}
