{"unnormalised": "Analyzing a budget involves looking at key ratios - the fiscal deficit (the difference between revenue and expenditure) and the debt-to-GDP ratio. For instance, Maharashtra aiming for a fiscal deficit within 3% of its GDP is a common headline. This is especially important, considering, say, a planned new IT park spanning 2 million sq ft requires significant infrastructural investment. The impact is felt locally in places like Pune, but is guided by the state budget.", "normalised": "Analyzing a budget involves looking at key ratios - the fiscal deficit (the difference between revenue and expenditure) and the debt to G D P ratio.
