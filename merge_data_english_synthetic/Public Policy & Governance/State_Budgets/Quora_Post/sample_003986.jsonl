{"unnormalised": "A robust state budget promotes transparency and accountability. Citizens can scrutinize how their tax Rupees are being allocated. For example, increased allocations to primary education in Rajasthan, or investments in healthcare facilities in Tamil Nadu, are directly reflected in the state budget documents. Deficits, debt levels, and fiscal responsibility targets are all key areas of analysis. Often, Dr. Sharma, an economist at the IIM-Ahmedabad, offers insightful commentary on these aspects. Issues like financing metro rail projects spanning hundreds of km, or allocating land for new industrial parks measuring in the millions of sq ft are regularly debated during the budget cycle.
