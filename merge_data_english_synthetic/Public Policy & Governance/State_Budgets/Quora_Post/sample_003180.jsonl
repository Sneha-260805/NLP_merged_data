A significant portion comes from the state's own tax revenue (G S T, sales tax on petrol etcetera), another major chunk is devolved from the Centre based on recommendations of the Finance Commission (currently the fifteenth Finance Commission), and then there are grants-in-aid. Maharashtra, for instance, gets a good share from its industrial activity."}

How much is being allocated to education (think schools, Doctor A P J Abdul Kalam universities), healthcare (hospitals, primary health centres), infrastructure (roads, flyovers, affordable housing initiatives in say, one B H K flats approximately five hundred square feet), agriculture (irrigation projects like the Indira Gandhi Canal)? This tells you about the government's priorities."}

A high deficit isn’t always bad, especially if the money is being used for productive investments like building infrastructure that generates future revenue. However, unsustainable levels can lead to debt traps. For example, states like Punjab have faced fiscal challenges."}

M L A s debate the proposals, and citizens can (and should!) engage with the details to hold their representatives accountable. The annual budget speech, often broadcast live, sets the tone for the financial year, and the subsequent detailed documents are usually available online. Rupee one thousand crores might seem like a lot, but what percentage of the total budget is it? Look at the allocation percentages for true understanding. Understanding these nuances is critical for anyone interested in public policy."}
