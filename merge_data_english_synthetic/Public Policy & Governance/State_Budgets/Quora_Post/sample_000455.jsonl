Revenue Projections and Realizations: Examining the state's projected revenue versus actual revenue is paramount. Are they overly optimistic? Do they accurately reflect the economic climate? A shortfall can severely impact development projects. For example, did Rajasthan's G S T collections meet their projected rupee fifty thousand crore target this fiscal year?"}

Fiscal Deficit and Debt Management: Understanding the state's fiscal deficit as a percentage of its Gross State Domestic Product (G S D P) is vital. How is the state managing its debt? High debt levels can hinder future development. A study by Doctor Sharma at I I M Ahmedabad showed that states with consistently high deficits struggle with infrastructure development."}
