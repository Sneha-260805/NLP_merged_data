{"unnormalised": "Firstly, **revenue generation** plays a critical role. States rely on taxes (GST, state excise), grants from the central government, and borrowings. Fluctuations in these revenue streams directly impact the size and scope of the budget. Consider, for example, how a poor monsoon season in Maharashtra might reduce agricultural income and, consequently, state GST collections.", "normalised": "Firstly, **revenue generation** plays a critical role.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, **central government directives and schemes** also influence allocations. Centrally sponsored schemes often require states to contribute a share, impacting their fiscal flexibility. Furthermore, adherence to Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) norms constrains borrowing. Allocations can range from Rs. 50 crores for rural development to Rs. 500 crores for metro projects in a city like Bengaluru, potentially covering thousands of sq ft of construction. These sums are obviously impacted by these factors.", "normalised": "Finally, **central government directives and schemes** also influence allocations.
