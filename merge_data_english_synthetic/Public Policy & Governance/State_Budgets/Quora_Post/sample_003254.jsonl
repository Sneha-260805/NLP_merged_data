{"unnormalised": "Why are they important? Well, state budgets directly impact the lives of ordinary citizens. A well-managed budget can lead to better healthcare (more doctors in rural areas, for example), improved infrastructure (like the Mumbai-Pune expressway) and enhanced educational opportunities.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding state budgets allows citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable. Dr. Sharma, an economist at IIM Lucknow, often emphasizes the need for transparency and public participation in the budget process. For example, citizens can access budget documents online and analyze spending patterns to see if the allocated Rs. 5,00,000 for a new community hall of 2,000 sq ft is justified or not. In West Bengal, the budget is presented by the Finance Minister and debated thoroughly. Ultimately, state budgets are not just numbers; they represent the state's commitment to its citizens and its vision for the future.", "normalised": "Understanding state budgets allows citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable.
