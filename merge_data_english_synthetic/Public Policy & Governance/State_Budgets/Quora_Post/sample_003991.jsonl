{"unnormalised": "Analyzing a state budget in India requires understanding several crucial factors. Firstly, scrutinize the **revenue sources**. How reliant is the state on central government transfers versus its own tax revenue (GST, VAT, stamp duty)? States like Kerala, for example, historically depend more on remittances, while industrialized states like Maharashtra have higher tax collections.", "normalised": "Analyzing a state budget in India requires understanding several crucial factors.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, examine the **expenditure allocation**. How much is earmarked for development (infrastructure, education, healthcare) versus non-development expenditure (salaries, debt servicing)? A budget heavy on non-development spending might indicate fiscal stress. Consider the allocations for schemes like MGNREGA or PM Kisan Samman Nidhi at the state level.", "normalised": "Secondly, examine the **expenditure allocation**.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, analyze the **fiscal deficit and debt levels**. Are they within the permissible limits prescribed by the FRBM Act? High debt levels can restrict a state's future investment capacity. Compare these figures to states with similar economic profiles, such as Tamil Nadu or Gujarat.", "normalised": "Thirdly, analyze the **fiscal deficit and debt levels**.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, pay attention to the **sectoral allocations**. For instance, what percentage of the budget is dedicated to agriculture in states like Punjab and Haryana? What is the planned investment in building new schools (with, say, 10,000 sq ft of built-up area per school) or hospitals in Uttar Pradesh?", "normalised": "Fourthly, pay attention to the **sectoral allocations**.

{"unnormalised": "Fifthly, consider the **implementation challenges**. Are there provisions for effective monitoring and evaluation of schemes? A well-intentioned scheme with poor implementation is ultimately ineffective.", "normalised": "Fifthly, consider the **implementation challenges**.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to contextualize the budget within the larger economic environment and political priorities. Dr. Arvind Subramanian's analyses are often insightful in this regard. Keep an eye on items such as proposed allocations for rural roads (Rs. 500 Cr) or irrigation projects (increasing area irrigated by 2000 km). A detailed reading, coupled with a clear understanding of these aspects, is key to analyzing any state budget.", "normalised": "Finally, remember to contextualize the budget within the larger economic environment and political priorities. Doctor Arvind Subramanian's analyses are often insightful in this regard. Keep an eye on items such as proposed allocations for rural roads (rupees five hundred crore) or irrigation projects (increasing area irrigated by two thousand kilometer). A detailed reading, coupled with a clear understanding of these aspects, is key to analyzing any state budget."}
