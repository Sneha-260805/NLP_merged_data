{"unnormalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach involving strong governance, participatory planning processes (consulting communities like during the drafting of the Navi Mumbai Master Plan on 26/01/2000), innovative financing mechanisms, and capacity building at the local level. Strengthening urban local bodies (ULBs) is vital for effective implementation. It is imperative that cities operate with integrated plans that consider water availability, electricity grids, and even the impact of extreme weather events (such as the Chennai floods on 01/12/2015).
