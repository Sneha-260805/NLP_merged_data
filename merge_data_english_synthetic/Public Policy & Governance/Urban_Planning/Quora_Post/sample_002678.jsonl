One of the primary challenges is managing the strain on existing infrastructure. Cities like Mumbai and Bangalore struggle with inadequate water supply, sanitation, and public transportation. The issue of affordable housing is also critical, particularly for the urban poor. Slum redevelopment schemes often face resistance and require careful consideration of social and economic impacts."}

The government's Smart Cities Mission, launched on twenty fifth june two thousand and fifteen, aims to improve urban infrastructure and governance in one hundred cities. Public Private Partnerships (P P Ps) can play a crucial role in financing and implementing urban development projects. Technology adoption, such as G I S mapping and data analytics, can help in better planning and resource allocation. The implementation of robust master plans and adherence to building codes are essential. The revised National Building Code of India (N B C two thousand and sixteen) provides guidelines for safe and sustainable construction. Furthermore, effective community participation and stakeholder engagement are crucial for successful urban planning initiatives. Imagine town hall meetings at ten hundred hours on a Saturday to consult with residents on zoning changes. Learning from successful international urban planning models and adapting them to the Indian context is also important. We must act strategically before India's demographic dividend turns into a demographic disaster by, say, two thousand and fifty."}
