{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India presents a complex landscape, riddled with challenges rooted in rapid urbanization and historical context. A primary obstacle is often inadequate infrastructure. Many cities, like Mumbai and Bengaluru, struggle to provide sufficient housing, water supply, and sanitation to accommodate their burgeoning populations. Slum redevelopment projects, though well-intentioned, often face resistance from residents and are hampered by bureaucratic delays. Consider the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, initiated years ago but still facing hurdles.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India presents a complex landscape, riddled with challenges rooted in rapid urbanization and historical context.

{"unnormalised": "Land acquisition is another significant hurdle. The Land Acquisition Act, even after amendments, can be a source of protracted legal battles, slowing down critical infrastructure projects. Furthermore, enforcement of zoning regulations is often lax, leading to unplanned development and environmental degradation. In many Tier II cities, these regulations are practically non-existent.", "normalised": "Land acquisition is another significant hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Effective public policy should prioritize: (1) investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades, including public transport like the Delhi Metro, with expansions planned by 2025, (2) streamlining land acquisition processes with fair compensation and rehabilitation packages, and (3) strengthening local governance and empowering urban local bodies to enforce regulations effectively. The Swachh Bharat Mission launched on 02/10/2014, provides a good example of a national initiative that needs sustained local implementation. Finally, citizen participation, like in participatory budgeting initiatives in Pune, is crucial for ensuring that urban planning projects align with the needs and aspirations of the people they are intended to serve. We need more effective oversight by 17:00 hrs daily.", "normalised": "Effective public policy should prioritize: one investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades, including public transport like the Delhi Metro, with expansions planned by two thousand and twenty five, two streamlining land acquisition processes with fair compensation and rehabilitation packages, and three strengthening local governance and empowering urban local bodies to enforce regulations effectively.
