A key challenge is the inadequacy of infrastructure to support the growing population in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Overcrowding, insufficient water supply, and inadequate waste management systems are commonplace."}

Firstly, there is a need for improved urban governance through empowered local bodies. The seventy fourth Constitutional Amendment Act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two aimed to decentralize urban governance, but its implementation remains uneven. Secondly, we need greater investment in public transportation, aiming for integrated multi-modal systems. A successful Mumbai local train from zero nine hundred hours to ten hundred hours is still a crowded affair, more options should be provided. Thirdly, affordable housing schemes, like the P M A Y (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), need to be scaled up and implemented more effectively."}

Promoting green buildings, conserving water resources, and managing waste effectively are crucial for creating livable and resilient cities. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, launched on twenty fifth June two thousand and fifteen, hold promise but require careful planning and execution. This needs to be done by two thousand and seventy at the latest for environmental goals as per C O P. Proper planning and regulations, along with a robust monitoring mechanism, are crucial for ensuring sustainable and equitable urban growth in India."}
