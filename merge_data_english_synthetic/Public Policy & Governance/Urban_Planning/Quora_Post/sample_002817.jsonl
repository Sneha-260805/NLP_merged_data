{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India faces a myriad of complex challenges. One significant issue is unplanned urbanization, particularly in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi. The influx of migrants seeking economic opportunities often outpaces the capacity of existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowded housing, inadequate sanitation, and strained public services.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India faces a myriad of complex challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical challenge is transportation. The increasing number of vehicles, coupled with inadequate public transportation systems, results in severe traffic congestion, air pollution, and increased commuting times. For instance, traveling across Bangalore can take upwards of 2 hours during peak hours (09:00 hrs - 11:00 hrs).", "normalised": "Another critical challenge is transportation.

Cities need to adopt green building practices, promote renewable energy, and conserve natural resources like water bodies. The Yamuna River in Delhi, for example, suffers severely from pollution due to inadequate wastewater treatment.", "normalised": "Furthermore, there's a pressing need for sustainable development.

{"unnormalised": "Land use planning also poses a challenge. In many cities, land is often used inefficiently, leading to a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas in the same vicinity. This can lead to conflicts and hinder the overall quality of life. The implementation of schemes like AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation), launched on 25/06/2015, aims to address some of these issues.", "normalised": "Land use planning also poses a challenge.

Citizen engagement in decision-making processes, coupled with transparent and accountable governance, can lead to more inclusive and sustainable urban development. Initiatives started after the 74th Amendment Act on 20/04/1992 sought to empower local bodies. Without proper planning, cities like Patna will continue to struggle with basic services and a compromised quality of life.", "normalised": "Finally, effective governance and community participation are vital for successful urban planning.
