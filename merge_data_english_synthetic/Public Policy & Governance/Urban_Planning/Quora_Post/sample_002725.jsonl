It encompasses a holistic approach, considering factors like transportation (e.g., developing robust metro systems like the Delhi Metro, aiming for seamless connectivity by 2025), housing (affordable options for all income levels), infrastructure (water, sanitation, waste management), and green spaces (parks and recreational areas). In cities like Mumbai, this requires tackling unique challenges such as dense population and limited land availability.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning goes beyond simply zoning land.
