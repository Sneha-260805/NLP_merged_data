However, implementation often falls short due to complex land acquisition processes, corruption, and a lack of coordination between various government agencies. Imagine trying to build new flyovers in Bengaluru while navigating existing legal disputes and funding issues – a true urban planning nightmare!", "normalised": "A good urban plan aims to provide affordable housing, efficient transportation (like the Delhi Metro, a game changer!), access to clean water and sanitation, and green spaces.

It indirectly highlights the importance of well-planned cities that cater to the evolving needs of their citizens. Urban planning needs more attention and resources so cities like Kolkata can better manage their infrastructure needs, or smaller towns like Patna can grow sustainably instead of experiencing uncontrolled sprawl that strains already limited resources. We need holistic plans that consider factors like population density (e.g., people per sq km in Dharavi), projected growth (e.g., expecting 1 crore new residents in Delhi by 2030), and budget allocations (e.g., Rs. 500 crore dedicated to sanitation projects).", "normalised": "Think of the Bollywood film \"Wake Up Sid\".
