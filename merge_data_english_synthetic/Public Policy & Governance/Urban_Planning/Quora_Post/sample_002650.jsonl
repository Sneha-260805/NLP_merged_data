Rapid, often unplanned, urbanization strains existing infrastructure. Think of the burgeoning population density in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Housing affordability remains a significant concern, particularly for low-income communities. Many struggle to find adequate shelter within a reasonable distance from their workplaces."}

Overflowing landfills and inadequate waste segregation facilities plague many Indian cities. Policy interventions could include stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, promotion of waste to energy projects, and public awareness campaigns on the importance of source segregation. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched on second October two thousand and fourteen is a step in the right direction, but sustained effort is required."}

Urban planning needs to prioritize inclusive development, ensuring that all residents, regardless of socioeconomic status, have access to essential services. Consider the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, a long-delayed initiative highlighting the complexities involved. Policy changes should facilitate faster project clearances and greater community participation. We need solutions before five P M daily causes more congestion. Finally, incorporating principles of sustainable development and climate resilience into urban planning is crucial to mitigate the impacts of climate change on Indian cities, especially given projections for increased flooding and heat waves. The planned greenfield cities, such as Dholera S I R, hold potential, but require careful monitoring. Many experts believe a revised National Urban Policy framework, incorporating lessons from past experiences and addressing current challenges, is urgently needed. This framework should be implemented before first January two thousand and twenty five to avoid further deterioration."}
