Rapid urbanization, especially since one thousand nine hundred and ninety one, has overwhelmed many cities. One significant hurdle is the informal settlements, or slums, that often lack basic amenities. Effective urban planning must address affordable housing, sanitation, and access to clean water for all residents, including those in informal settlements like Dharavi in Mumbai."}
