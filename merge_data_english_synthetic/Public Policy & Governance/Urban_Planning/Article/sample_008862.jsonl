{"unnormalised": "However, challenges persist. Rapid population growth, inadequate infrastructure, and informal settlements continue to strain urban resources. Many Indian cities struggle with issues like traffic congestion, air pollution, and a lack of affordable housing. Slum rehabilitation projects, often fraught with controversy, highlight the complexities of balancing development with the needs of marginalized communities. Consider the ongoing debate surrounding the redevelopment of Dharavi in Mumbai, a massive undertaking involving public-private partnerships and aiming to transform one of Asia's largest slums into a modern urban district.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.

By adopting a holistic and integrated approach, informed by sound public policy and good governance, India can harness the potential of its cities to drive economic growth, improve quality of life, and ensure a sustainable future for all its citizens. This includes addressing the infrastructural backlog of Rs. 50,000 crore in certain metropolitan areas and expanding public transportation networks by at least 200 km in the next decade.", "normalised": "In conclusion, urban planning is a critical instrument for shaping India's future.
