{"unnormalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is the effective implementation of master plans. Many cities face difficulties in enforcing land use regulations and controlling unauthorized construction, leading to haphazard development. The legacy of colonial planning approaches, often prioritizing segregation and control, also needs to be addressed by incorporating participatory planning processes that involve local communities and stakeholders. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 sought to empower Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and devolve planning functions to them, but effective implementation remains a challenge.", "normalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is the effective implementation of master plans.

The Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link, inaugurated on 12/01/2024, showcases the ambitious infrastructure projects undertaken, but also highlights the need for meticulous environmental impact assessments and mitigation strategies.

Initiatives like integrated transport systems, waste management projects, and green building practices are essential for creating resilient and livable cities. Public participation and community engagement are also crucial for ensuring that urban planning reflects the needs and aspirations of the citizens. Successful examples like the Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched on 03/12/2005 at 09:00 hrs, demonstrated the potential of targeted urban renewal programs, though challenges in project implementation and financial sustainability were also apparent.
