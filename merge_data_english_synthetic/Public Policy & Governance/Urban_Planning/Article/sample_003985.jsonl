{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India is a multifaceted discipline deeply intertwined with public policy and governance, demanding a comprehensive approach to address the complexities of rapid urbanization. It encompasses the design, development, and management of urban spaces, striving to create sustainable, equitable, and livable environments for all citizens. The efficacy of urban planning directly impacts a vast spectrum of socio-economic factors, ranging from infrastructure provision and housing affordability to environmental sustainability and economic growth.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India is a multifaceted discipline deeply intertwined with public policy and governance, demanding a comprehensive approach to address the complexities of rapid urbanization.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges facing Indian urban planners is the sheer scale and pace of urbanization. Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata are experiencing unprecedented population growth, placing immense strain on existing infrastructure and resources. This necessitates strategic planning interventions that consider both immediate needs and long-term sustainability. For instance, the development of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), a mega-infrastructure project spanning 6 states and encompassing approximately 1500 km, requires meticulous urban planning to ensure that new industrial zones are integrated seamlessly with existing urban centers, minimizing environmental impact and maximizing economic opportunities.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges facing Indian urban planners is the sheer scale and pace of urbanization.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, urban planning in India must address the pervasive issue of social inequality. Slums and informal settlements continue to proliferate in many cities, highlighting the urgent need for inclusive planning policies that prioritize affordable housing and access to basic services for marginalized communities. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a government scheme aimed at providing housing for all by 2022, exemplifies an attempt to tackle this challenge. However, effective implementation requires decentralized planning processes that involve local communities in decision-making.", "normalised": "Furthermore, urban planning in India must address the pervasive issue of social inequality.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban governance is inextricably linked to successful urban planning. This requires strong leadership, transparent decision-making processes, and the active participation of citizens. Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies can undermine even the most well-intentioned plans.

Cities contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and face increasing risks from climate change. Integrating green infrastructure, promoting public transportation, and investing in renewable energy are essential for creating climate-resilient cities. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission aim to leverage technology and data to improve urban infrastructure and promote sustainable development.", "normalised": "Moreover, environmental sustainability is a paramount concern in Indian urban planning.
