{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, India needs to prioritize integrated urban planning that considers the interconnectedness of different urban systems. This includes investing in sustainable transportation options, promoting mixed-use developments, and ensuring equitable access to basic services for all residents. Technological advancements, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data analytics, can be leveraged to improve urban planning processes. Furthermore, fostering greater collaboration between government agencies, private sector actors, and civil society organizations is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive urban development in India. Successful planning efforts require sustained political will, robust institutional capacity, and a commitment to creating cities that are both economically vibrant and socially just, capable of supporting the well-being of all citizens, from the bustling metropolises to the smaller towns and settlements spread across the diverse landscapes, potentially impacting areas as vast as 1000 km² or more.", "normalised": "Moving forward, India needs to prioritize integrated urban planning that considers the interconnectedness of different urban systems.
