{"unnormalised": "The goal of urban planning extends beyond mere infrastructure development. It encompasses a holistic approach, considering factors like economic growth, environmental sustainability, social equity, and cultural preservation. This is particularly important in a diverse nation like India, where urban planning must navigate the complexities of varying cultural landscapes and socio-economic disparities. For example, the redevelopment of Dharavi in Mumbai requires a sensitive approach that considers the livelihoods and social fabric of its residents, not just physical reconstruction.", "normalised": "The goal of urban planning extends beyond mere infrastructure development.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of effective urban planning policies requires robust governance structures and strong inter-departmental coordination. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, aim to leverage technology and data-driven approaches to improve urban infrastructure and services in select Indian cities. These missions highlight the need for strategic planning and resource allocation to ensure effective project implementation. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are also playing an increasingly important role in financing and executing urban development projects, such as the Delhi Metro expansion, requiring careful regulatory oversight and risk management frameworks.", "normalised": "The implementation of effective urban planning policies requires robust governance structures and strong inter-departmental coordination.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, citizen participation is crucial for the success of urban planning initiatives. Engaging local communities in the planning process ensures that their needs and aspirations are considered, leading to more inclusive and sustainable urban environments. This can involve public consultations, participatory mapping exercises, and the establishment of citizen advisory committees. The 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', launched on 02/10/2014, demonstrates the power of citizen engagement in achieving national-level urban sanitation goals.", "normalised": "Furthermore, citizen participation is crucial for the success of urban planning initiatives.

Initiatives like the establishment of the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and the development of model building bylaws are steps in the right direction. By 2030, projected urban population increase in India demands proactive policy changes and allocation of adequate funds; The allocation of Rs. 79,596 crore in the 2023-24 Union Budget for urban infrastructure development signals the government's commitment. Furthermore, embracing innovative solutions like green building technologies and sustainable transportation systems is crucial for creating livable and resilient cities. The clock is ticking; from 09:00 hrs onwards, dedicated efforts are paramount to build a future where Indian cities become engines of economic growth and hubs of social progress.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest in capacity building for urban planners and strengthen the regulatory framework to promote planned and sustainable urban development.
