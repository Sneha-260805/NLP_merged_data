{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, as a critical facet of public policy and governance, addresses the spatial organization and development of urban areas. In India, with its rapidly growing urban population and complex socio-economic dynamics, effective urban planning is paramount for sustainable development, economic prosperity, and citizen well-being. The discipline encompasses a wide range of activities, from land use zoning and transportation infrastructure development to housing provision and environmental management.", "normalised": "Urban planning, as a critical facet of public policy and governance, addresses the spatial organization and development of urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has been influenced by colonial legacies and post-independence development paradigms. Early plans often prioritized large-scale infrastructure projects, sometimes at the expense of community needs and environmental sustainability. More recently, there's been a shift towards more inclusive and participatory approaches, recognizing the importance of engaging citizens in the planning process. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission aim to leverage technology and data-driven approaches to improve urban services and quality of life. However, challenges remain in terms of implementation capacity, financial resources, and inter-agency coordination.", "normalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has been influenced by colonial legacies and post-independence development paradigms.

{"unnormalised": "Key areas of focus in Indian urban planning include addressing the housing deficit, particularly for low-income groups. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aims to provide affordable housing for all by 2022, a target that faces considerable hurdles. Transportation planning is another critical area, with efforts underway to develop integrated public transport systems, reduce traffic congestion, and promote sustainable mobility options such as cycling and walking. Metros in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore represent significant investments in urban transportation infrastructure, but their effectiveness depends on integration with other modes of transport.", "normalised": "Key areas of focus in Indian urban planning include addressing the housing deficit, particularly for low-income groups.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, environmental sustainability is increasingly recognized as a core principle of urban planning. Cities face challenges related to air and water pollution, waste management, and climate change. Green infrastructure, such as urban forests and green roofs, are gaining prominence as strategies for mitigating these challenges. The National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) plays a significant role in research and capacity building in urban planning, contributing to evidence-based policy making.", "normalised": "Furthermore, environmental sustainability is increasingly recognized as a core principle of urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-disciplinary approach, involving architects, engineers, planners, social scientists, and economists. It also necessitates strong political will, effective governance structures, and adequate financial resources. Investing in urban planning is not merely an expenditure; it's an investment in the future of India, ensuring that its cities are livable, equitable, and sustainable for all its citizens. Allocations for urban development are often expressed in terms of Rs. Crores in annual budgets, and projects may span several years and kilometers of infrastructure. The success of any urban plan relies on the effective use of such resources.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-disciplinary approach, involving architects, engineers, planners, social scientists, and economists.
