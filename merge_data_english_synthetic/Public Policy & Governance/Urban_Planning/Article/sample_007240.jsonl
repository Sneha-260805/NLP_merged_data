{"unnormalised": "However, the implementation of urban plans often encounters hurdles. Land acquisition complexities, bureaucratic delays, and inadequate financial resources impede progress. The revised Master Plan of Delhi 2021, for instance, faced significant delays in implementation due to legal challenges and coordination issues among various agencies. Furthermore, participatory planning, involving citizens and local communities, remains a challenge. Often, urban plans are perceived as top-down approaches, neglecting the needs and preferences of marginalized populations.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of urban plans often encounters hurdles.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India needs to embrace innovative approaches and leverage technology to address emerging challenges. Geospatial technologies, data analytics, and citizen engagement platforms can enhance planning processes and improve decision-making. Furthermore, promoting mixed-use developments, transit-oriented development, and affordable housing initiatives are crucial for creating sustainable and equitable cities. The integration of climate resilience strategies into urban plans is also essential, given the increasing vulnerability of Indian cities to climate change impacts, as evidenced by the Chennai floods of 2015 and recurring heatwaves.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India needs to embrace innovative approaches and leverage technology to address emerging challenges.
