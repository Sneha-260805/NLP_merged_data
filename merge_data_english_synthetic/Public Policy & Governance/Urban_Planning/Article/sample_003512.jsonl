{"unnormalised": "One key element of urban planning is land use management. Zoning regulations, for example, determine which activities are permitted in specific areas, separating residential zones from industrial areas to minimize pollution and noise. Master plans, often spanning 20-30 years, guide the overall development of a city, outlining proposed land use, infrastructure projects, and transportation networks. The Delhi Master Plan 2021, for instance, aimed to address issues of congestion and housing shortages through strategic planning.", "normalised": "One key element of urban planning is land use management.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation planning is another crucial aspect. With increasing vehicle ownership, cities like Mumbai and Bangalore face severe traffic congestion. Urban planners need to develop integrated transportation systems, including public transportation networks like the metro rail, bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, such as cycle tracks and wider footpaths. Investing in these initiatives can reduce reliance on private vehicles and improve air quality.", "normalised": "Transportation planning is another crucial aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Housing is a fundamental need that requires careful planning. With a significant portion of the urban population residing in slums and informal settlements, affordable housing schemes are essential. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aim to provide affordable housing to the urban poor. Urban planners also need to incorporate mixed-income housing developments to promote social equity and prevent the formation of segregated communities. For example, constructing affordable housing complexes on vacant plots of land measuring 10,000 sq ft near IT hubs can reduce commute times for low-income workers.", "normalised": "Housing is a fundamental need that requires careful planning.

{"unnormalised": "Environmental sustainability is increasingly important in urban planning. Incorporating green spaces, promoting water conservation, and managing waste effectively are crucial. Cities can invest in developing parks, urban forests, and green roofs to mitigate the urban heat island effect. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam advocated for sustainable development practices in urban areas, emphasizing the importance of renewable energy and resource conservation. Furthermore, effective waste management strategies, including waste segregation at source and the development of waste-to-energy plants, are necessary to minimize pollution and protect public health. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has implemented several initiatives to improve waste management in the city.", "normalised": "Environmental sustainability is increasingly important in urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban governance is essential for successful urban planning. This includes transparent decision-making processes, citizen participation, and collaboration between different government agencies. Local governance bodies like Municipal Corporations need to be empowered and equipped with the resources necessary to implement urban plans effectively. Public consultation and feedback mechanisms are vital to ensure that urban planning initiatives are aligned with the needs and aspirations of the people. Rs. 50 crore could be allocated in the budget for citizen participation programs.", "normalised": "Effective urban governance is essential for successful urban planning.
