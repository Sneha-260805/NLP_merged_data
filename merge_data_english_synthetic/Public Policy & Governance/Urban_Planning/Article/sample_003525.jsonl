{"unnormalised": "The core principles of urban planning encompass land use zoning, transportation planning, infrastructure development (water, sanitation, electricity), housing provision, and the preservation of heritage and green spaces. A well-structured urban plan considers demographics, socio-economic factors, and environmental constraints to allocate land efficiently and ensure the availability of essential services. For instance, a successful plan in Mumbai might prioritize affordable housing near industrial areas to reduce commute times and traffic congestion.", "normalised": "The core principles of urban planning encompass land use zoning, transportation planning, infrastructure development (water, sanitation, electricity), housing provision, and the preservation of heritage and green spaces.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges abound in implementing effective urban planning in India. Rapid and often unplanned urbanization, coupled with inadequate infrastructure and weak enforcement of regulations, contributes to problems like traffic congestion, pollution, and the growth of informal settlements. Slums, often lacking basic amenities, exemplify the failure of urban planning to cater to the needs of all residents, particularly the economically disadvantaged. Dharavi in Mumbai, one of Asia's largest slums, highlights the urgent need for inclusive and participatory urban planning strategies.", "normalised": "Challenges abound in implementing effective urban planning in India.

{"unnormalised": "Public policy must prioritize sustainable urban development by promoting compact city models, investing in public transportation, and encouraging green building practices. For example, constructing multi-level parking complexes in congested areas like Connaught Place, Delhi, can alleviate traffic woes. Integrated transit systems, including metro rail, buses, and cycle tracks, are essential for reducing reliance on private vehicles. The Metro project in cities like Bangalore has demonstrably improved connectivity and reduced commute times.", "normalised": "Public policy must prioritize sustainable urban development by promoting compact city models, investing in public transportation, and encouraging green building practices.

Consulting with residents, local businesses, and civil society organizations during the planning process ensures that the needs and concerns of all stakeholders are addressed. A successful urban renewal project in Kolkata, for example, might involve relocating vendors to designated hawker zones while revitalizing public spaces.", "normalised": "Moreover, effective urban planning requires community participation.

{"unnormalised": "Consider a housing project aiming to provide affordable housing units of 500 sq ft to low-income families in a city like Chennai. This project needs careful planning with regards to water supply (say 100 liters per capita per day), sanitation, and access to public transport. The financial outlay might be in the range of Rs. 200 Crores, and the entire process from planning to completion could take approximately 5 years.", "normalised": "Consider a housing project aiming to provide affordable housing units of five hundred square feet to low-income families in a city like Chennai.
