{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, within the context of public policy and governance in India, constitutes a vital framework for managing and shaping the growth and development of urban centers. It’s a multidisciplinary field encompassing land use management, infrastructure development, transportation planning, environmental protection, and socio-economic equity. Effective urban planning is crucial for ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth, improving the quality of life for residents, and fostering economic prosperity within cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai.", "normalised": "Urban planning, within the context of public policy and governance in India, constitutes a vital framework for managing and shaping the growth and development of urban centers.

{"unnormalised": "A significant challenge in Indian urban planning lies in the rapid and often unplanned urbanization driven by rural-to-urban migration and economic growth. This has resulted in issues such as inadequate housing, traffic congestion, pollution, and a lack of access to essential services, particularly for vulnerable populations residing in informal settlements. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, was a significant attempt to address some of these challenges by providing funding and technical assistance to cities for infrastructure development and urban governance reforms.", "normalised": "A significant challenge in Indian urban planning lies in the rapid and often unplanned urbanization driven by rural-to-urban migration and economic growth.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, land acquisition remains a contentious issue, often delaying infrastructure projects and exacerbating social inequalities. The need for a more transparent and participatory land acquisition process is critical. Integrating traditional knowledge and local contexts into urban planning strategies is also essential for creating culturally relevant and sustainable urban environments. For instance, the principles of Vastu Shastra are sometimes considered in housing layouts and building design, although their scientific validity is debated.", "normalised": "Furthermore, land acquisition remains a contentious issue, often delaying infrastructure projects and exacerbating social inequalities.

{"unnormalised": "Bollywood often reflects the aspirations and anxieties surrounding urban life. Films like \"Wake Up Sid\" (2009) show a young man navigating the complexities of modern Mumbai, highlighting the challenges of career choices, relationships, and finding one's place in a rapidly changing urban landscape. While not directly about urban planning, such films offer a glimpse into the socio-cultural dynamics that urban planners must consider.", "normalised": "Bollywood often reflects the aspirations and anxieties surrounding urban life.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, effective urban planning in India requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, private sector developers, civil society organizations, and, most importantly, the residents themselves. Embracing technology, promoting sustainable development principles, and ensuring equitable access to resources are essential for creating livable, resilient, and prosperous cities for all. Investments in public transportation, affordable housing schemes (such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), and smart city initiatives (with proposed budgets of several Rs. crores per city) are critical steps towards realizing this vision. The future success of India hinges significantly on how effectively it manages its urban growth and harnesses the potential of its cities. The target is to provide basic amenities and a sustainable environment for all citizens within a radius of 5 km in urban areas by 2030.", "normalised": "Moving forward, effective urban planning in India requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, private sector developers, civil society organizations, and, most importantly, the residents themselves.
