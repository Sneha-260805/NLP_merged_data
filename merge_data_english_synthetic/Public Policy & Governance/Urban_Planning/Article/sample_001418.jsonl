{"unnormalised": "However, implementation remains a significant hurdle. Master plans, often conceived with a long-term vision, frequently fall short due to factors such as inadequate stakeholder consultation, lack of financial resources, and bureaucratic delays. For instance, the revised Master Plan for Delhi, finalized in 2021, faces challenges in addressing the city's sprawling unauthorized colonies and ensuring affordable housing. Moreover, the complex land ownership patterns and the prevalence of informal settlements, such as those observed in Dharavi, Mumbai, necessitate innovative and inclusive planning strategies that go beyond conventional zoning regulations.", "normalised": "However, implementation remains a significant hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Good governance in urban planning hinges on several key factors. Firstly, robust data collection and analysis are essential for evidence-based decision-making. Secondly, participatory planning processes, involving local communities, NGOs, and subject matter experts, can enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of plans. For example, involving residents of a chawl in Mumbai in the redevelopment process can lead to solutions that better meet their needs and preserve their cultural heritage. Thirdly, effective enforcement mechanisms are crucial to prevent unauthorized construction and ensure compliance with planning regulations. The demolition drive carried out in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi, on 09:00 hrs, 09/05/2022 highlighted the complexities and controversies surrounding enforcement.", "normalised": "Good governance in urban planning hinges on several key factors.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, capacity building of urban planning professionals and elected officials is vital. Institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) need to continuously update their curricula to reflect the evolving challenges and opportunities of Indian urban development. Finally, innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships (PPPs) and municipal bonds, are needed to bridge the infrastructure gap and ensure the financial sustainability of urban development projects. Consider the Bandra-Worli Sea Link project, a PPP initiative that has significantly improved connectivity in Mumbai.", "normalised": "Furthermore, capacity building of urban planning professionals and elected officials is vital.

The successful implementation of initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the Swachh Bharat Mission by 20:00 hrs on 02/10/2014 is crucial for improving the quality of life for millions of urban dwellers and achieving India's sustainable development goals. Addressing issues like traffic congestion, pollution, and water scarcity requires coordinated efforts across various government departments and a strong commitment to long-term strategic planning. Addressing these issues requires potentially billions of Rs. in investment.", "normalised": "The future of Indian cities depends on embracing a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning that considers environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic prosperity.
