With rapid urbanization, particularly in metropolises like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, effective urban planning strategies are indispensable for sustainable growth and equitable resource distribution. The Government of India, recognizing this urgency, has implemented various initiatives, including the Smart Cities Mission launched on 25/06/2015, to address the challenges associated with unplanned urban sprawl.", "normalised": "Urban planning, a critical facet of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic landscape of India.

{"unnormalised": "The core objective of urban planning is to optimize land use, improve infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life for urban dwellers. This involves careful consideration of factors such as transportation networks, housing, sanitation, water supply, and environmental sustainability. In the Indian context, this often requires navigating complex issues related to land ownership, informal settlements (slums), and the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the preservation of the historical Jama Masjid area in Delhi requires a delicate balance between modernization and the safeguarding of its unique cultural identity.", "normalised": "The core objective of urban planning is to optimize land use, improve infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life for urban dwellers.

{"unnormalised": "A key aspect of urban planning in India is the development of Master Plans. These comprehensive documents, prepared by urban local bodies in consultation with state governments, outline the long-term vision for urban development. The Delhi Master Plan 2021, for instance, aimed to address issues such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and environmental degradation. However, the successful implementation of these plans often hinges on effective governance and coordination between various agencies.", "normalised": "A key aspect of urban planning in India is the development of Master Plans.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee and other premier institutions play a vital role in training urban planners and conducting research to inform policy decisions. Furthermore, participatory planning approaches, involving citizens and community representatives in the decision-making process, are increasingly being recognized as essential for ensuring that urban development projects are responsive to the needs of the local population. Public hearings, often scheduled around 11:00 hrs to accommodate working professionals, are crucial for gathering feedback on proposed infrastructure projects.", "normalised": "The Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Roorkee and other premier institutions play a vital role in training urban planners and conducting research to inform policy decisions.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest in strengthening its urban planning capabilities, promoting sustainable development practices, and fostering greater transparency and accountability in governance. Initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) are steps in the right direction, but sustained commitment and innovative solutions are needed to create livable and prosperous cities for all. The focus should be on creating inclusive urban spaces where citizens, regardless of their socio-economic background, can access essential services and opportunities for growth. The estimated cost of upgrading urban infrastructure across India is projected to be in the range of Rs. 39.2 lakh crore over the next 20 years, highlighting the scale of the challenge. Improving urban planning can also reduce the number of km a citizen needs to travel on a daily basis by increasing walkability.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest in strengthening its urban planning capabilities, promoting sustainable development practices, and fostering greater transparency and accountability in governance.
