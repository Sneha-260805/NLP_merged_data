{"unnormalised": "One of the core functions of urban planning is the creation of comprehensive development plans (CDPs). These plans, mandated under various state and central government policies, outline the long-term vision for a city, specifying land use zones, infrastructure development projects, and strategies for addressing social and environmental issues. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), for instance, plays a pivotal role in formulating and implementing CDPs for the National Capital Territory. Successfully executing these plans often involves navigating complex land acquisition processes and ensuring equitable distribution of resources, a process often fraught with delays and legal challenges. Consider the challenges faced during the implementation of the Delhi Master Plan 2021, particularly with regards to resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced communities.", "normalised": "One of the core functions of urban planning is the creation of comprehensive development plans (C D P s).

{"unnormalised": "Infrastructure development forms a significant component of urban planning. Provision of adequate housing, water supply, sanitation, transportation networks (including roads, public transport systems like the Delhi Metro, and pedestrian infrastructure), and energy infrastructure are crucial for a well-functioning urban ecosystem. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, aimed to address these infrastructure deficits in various Indian cities. Currently, the AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) scheme continues to build upon these efforts, focusing on water supply, sewerage, and urban transport. For example, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is responsible for a vast array of infrastructure projects, including the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link, demonstrating the scale of planning and execution involved.", "normalised": "Infrastructure development forms a significant component of urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Social equity and inclusivity are central to effective urban planning. Planning must consider the needs of all segments of society, including marginalized communities, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. Policies that promote affordable housing, access to public services, and safe public spaces are crucial. Slum redevelopment initiatives like the Rajiv Awas Yojana, though ambitious, have faced hurdles in ensuring that residents are not further marginalized. The challenge lies in balancing developmental needs with the rights and needs of the most vulnerable populations. Consultation with local communities is also essential, however often happens post-facto, around 14:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Social equity and inclusivity are central to effective urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Environmental sustainability is another critical consideration. Urban planning must address issues of air and water pollution, waste management, and climate change adaptation. Promoting green spaces, developing sustainable transportation systems, and implementing energy-efficient building codes are essential strategies. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) plays an important role in enforcing environmental regulations and holding authorities accountable for non-compliance. The enforcement of environmental norms at construction sites needs stringent monitoring starting 01/01/2024.", "normalised": "Environmental sustainability is another critical consideration.

{"unnormalised": "The effective implementation of urban plans requires strong governance and institutional capacity. This includes qualified urban planners, transparent decision-making processes, and robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Capacity building of municipal bodies and local governments is crucial for effective urban management. Furthermore, the use of technology, such as GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and data analytics, can enhance planning efficiency and facilitate evidence-based decision-making. Property tax reforms are also needed to provide adequate financial resources to urban local bodies, however this remains a challenge, even after many years, i.e. after 15/08/1947. The role of private sector participation, through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), is also growing in infrastructure development and service delivery, requiring careful regulation and oversight.", "normalised": "The effective implementation of urban plans requires strong governance and institutional capacity.
