{"unnormalised": "The governance of urban planning in India is a multi-layered process, involving central, state, and local government bodies. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs at the national level provides policy guidance and financial support for urban development initiatives. State governments are responsible for formulating their own urban planning legislation and implementing projects within their respective jurisdictions. Local bodies, such as municipal corporations and urban local bodies (ULBs), are tasked with the day-to-day management of urban areas and the implementation of approved plans.", "normalised": "The governance of urban planning in India is a multi-layered process, involving central, state, and local government bodies.

{"unnormalised": "However, the implementation of urban planning policies in India faces several challenges. Land acquisition processes can be lengthy and contentious, often delaying infrastructure projects. Funding constraints, particularly at the local level, can hinder the implementation of comprehensive plans. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled urban planners and a lack of public awareness about planning processes can impede effective governance. For instance, the redevelopment of Dharavi in Mumbai, a project conceived years ago, has faced numerous hurdles due to land ownership issues and resettlement challenges.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of urban planning policies in India faces several challenges.
