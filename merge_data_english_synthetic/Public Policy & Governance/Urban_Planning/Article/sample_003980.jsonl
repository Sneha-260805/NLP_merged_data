{"unnormalised": "The core principles of urban planning in the Indian context involve integrated land use management, transportation infrastructure development, provision of essential services (water, sanitation, waste management), and ensuring affordable housing. These areas are intricately linked and require a holistic approach to avoid unintended consequences like urban sprawl, traffic congestion, and environmental degradation. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, GoI, spearheads many initiatives aimed at modernizing urban governance, including the Smart Cities Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). These programs aim to improve urban infrastructure and service delivery across selected cities.", "normalised": "The core principles of urban planning in the Indian context involve integrated land use management, transportation infrastructure development, provision of essential services (water, sanitation, waste management), and ensuring affordable housing.

{"unnormalised": "A critical challenge in Indian urban planning is addressing the vast informal sector and its impact on urban form. Millions of people live in informal settlements, lacking access to basic amenities and vulnerable to displacement. Inclusive urban planning strategies must prioritize regularization and upgrading of these settlements, integrating them into the formal urban fabric. Models like participatory planning, involving local communities in decision-making processes, are gaining traction in addressing this challenge. The concept is rooted in the Gandhian philosophy of Gram Swaraj, decentralizing power and empowering local communities.", "normalised": "A critical challenge in Indian urban planning is addressing the vast informal sector and its impact on urban form.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, robust enforcement of building codes and land use regulations is crucial. Instances of illegal construction and land encroachment are rampant, often fueled by corruption and lack of accountability. Strengthening urban local bodies (ULBs) and enhancing their capacity to enforce regulations are essential steps. This includes investing in technology, training personnel, and implementing transparent and efficient governance systems.", "normalised": "Furthermore, robust enforcement of building codes and land use regulations is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "The integration of technology is becoming increasingly important. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), data analytics, and smart technologies can be leveraged to improve planning, monitoring, and service delivery. Imagine a scenario, not unlike the dystopian settings explored in some Bollywood films (like 'Deewar' perhaps, with its stark portrayal of urban poverty), where inadequate planning leads to social unrest. Sound urban planning provides the bulwark against such scenarios.", "normalised": "The integration of technology is becoming increasingly important.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, investment in sustainable transportation infrastructure is paramount. Prioritizing public transport, promoting cycling and walking, and developing efficient road networks are essential to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Projects like the Delhi Metro are prime examples of how mass transit systems can transform urban mobility. The IITs and other engineering colleges must also be actively involved in developing innovative and cost-effective urban planning solutions tailored to the Indian context.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investment in sustainable transportation infrastructure is paramount.

It demands collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector, civil society organizations, and citizens. Only then can we create cities that are not only economically vibrant but also socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Investing Rs. 500 crore in upgrading the water supply network in Varanasi will only yield the desired results if accompanied by comprehensive urban planning that takes into account future growth patterns.", "normalised": "Finally, effective urban planning requires a long term vision, strategic thinking, and strong political will.
