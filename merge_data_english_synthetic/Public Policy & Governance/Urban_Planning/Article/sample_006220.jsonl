{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a critical arm of public policy and governance, essential for managing the complexities arising from rapid urbanization. The country's diverse landscape, ranging from bustling metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi to burgeoning Tier-II cities such as Lucknow and Jaipur, presents unique challenges that demand nuanced and adaptive planning strategies. Effective urban planning aims to ensure sustainable development, equitable access to resources, and enhanced quality of life for all citizens.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a critical arm of public policy and governance, essential for managing the complexities arising from rapid urbanization.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, urban development in India was often reactive rather than proactive. However, with initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), the focus has shifted towards integrated and long-term planning. These missions strive to provide essential infrastructure, including water supply, sewerage, and urban transport, while incorporating principles of environmental sustainability and citizen participation.", "normalised": "Historically, urban development in India was often reactive rather than proactive.

{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect of urban planning is land use management. This involves the allocation of land for various purposes, such as residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational use. Master Plans, typically prepared by urban local bodies like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, play a vital role in guiding land use decisions. These plans are designed to accommodate population growth, promote economic activity, and preserve green spaces. Challenges in this area include land acquisition issues, informal settlements, and the need to balance development with environmental protection.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect of urban planning is land use management.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation planning is another critical element. Congestion, pollution, and inadequate public transport systems plague many Indian cities. Integrated transport systems, including metro rail networks (e.g., the Delhi Metro), bus rapid transit systems (BRTS), and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, are essential for promoting sustainable mobility. Projects like the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link, a 22 km bridge connecting Mumbai with Navi Mumbai, are aimed at decongesting existing routes and facilitating regional connectivity.", "normalised": "Transportation planning is another critical element.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must address the needs of vulnerable populations. Slum redevelopment and affordable housing initiatives are crucial for ensuring inclusive growth. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aims to provide affordable housing to all by 2022, addressing a significant housing deficit. However, effective implementation requires careful consideration of resettlement policies and the preservation of social networks.", "normalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must address the needs of vulnerable populations.

{"unnormalised": "Capacity building within urban local bodies is paramount. Institutions like the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) play a crucial role in training urban planners and equipping them with the skills necessary to address contemporary challenges. Like the sprawling, interconnected lives depicted in Bollywood films like \"Wake Up Sid,\" urban planning necessitates a deep understanding of social fabrics and a commitment to creating livable and equitable spaces. Investment in infrastructure and training is vital to achieving the desired outcomes. Successfully navigating the complexities of urban growth will define India's development trajectory in the coming decades.", "normalised": "Capacity building within urban local bodies is paramount.
