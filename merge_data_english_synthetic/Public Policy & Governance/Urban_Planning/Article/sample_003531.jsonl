{"unnormalised": "The primary goal of urban planning is to create livable and functional cities. This involves a multifaceted approach that considers factors like land use, transportation networks, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability. Master Plans, like those developed for cities such as Mumbai and Delhi, serve as guiding documents outlining the long-term vision for urban growth. These plans typically incorporate zoning regulations that dictate permitted land uses in different areas (residential, commercial, industrial), ensuring a balanced urban environment.", "normalised": "The primary goal of urban planning is to create livable and functional cities.
