{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, in the Indian context, is a critical facet of public policy and governance, impacting everything from economic growth to social equity. It encompasses the strategic management of land use, infrastructure development, transportation networks, and housing provisions within urban areas, striving to create sustainable, livable, and economically vibrant cities. The effectiveness of urban planning directly influences the quality of life for millions of citizens, shaping their access to essential services, opportunities, and a healthy environment.", "normalised": "Urban planning, in the Indian context, is a critical facet of public policy and governance, impacting everything from economic growth to social equity.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has evolved through distinct phases. Post-independence, the focus was largely on industrialization and providing basic housing for the burgeoning urban population migrating from rural areas. This led to the establishment of planned cities like Chandigarh, envisioned by Le Corbusier, but also resulted in sprawling, unplanned settlements in major metropolises. More recently, the emphasis has shifted towards sustainable development, smart city initiatives, and participatory planning processes that involve local communities in decision-making. Institutions like the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) play a crucial role in research, capacity building, and providing technical assistance to state and local governments in formulating and implementing urban development plans.", "normalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has evolved through distinct phases.

{"unnormalised": "However, significant challenges persist. Rapid urbanization, driven by economic opportunities and rural distress, often outpaces the capacity of urban infrastructure. This leads to congestion, pollution, inadequate sanitation, and housing shortages, particularly for low-income groups. Land acquisition remains a contentious issue, often delaying infrastructure projects and exacerbating inequalities. Furthermore, effective implementation of urban plans is frequently hampered by bureaucratic inefficiencies, lack of coordination between government agencies, and inadequate financial resources. The concept of transit-oriented development, though gaining traction, faces hurdles in terms of land availability and financial viability.", "normalised": "However, significant challenges persist.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban governance is paramount. This requires strengthening the capacity of urban local bodies (ULBs) to plan, implement, and manage urban development projects. Decentralization of powers and functions to ULBs, as envisioned by the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, is crucial for enabling them to respond effectively to local needs. Moreover, promoting citizen participation in urban planning processes is essential for ensuring accountability and responsiveness.", "normalised": "Effective urban governance is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Just as the Bollywood film 'Swades' highlighted the importance of rural development, we need a similar cinematic portrayal to emphasize the critical role of urban planning in shaping India's future. Urban planning requires a long-term vision, a multi-disciplinary approach, and a strong commitment to social justice. Addressing the challenges of urbanization effectively will be crucial for achieving India's sustainable development goals and ensuring a better quality of life for all its citizens. Investing in robust urban planning frameworks, empowered local governance, and inclusive development strategies is not just an economic imperative, but also a fundamental ethical obligation. The successful implementation of initiatives like AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission hinges on the efficacy of urban planning at the grassroots level, demanding meticulous attention to detail and community-centric approach.", "normalised": "Just as the Bollywood film 'Swades' highlighted the importance of rural development, we need a similar cinematic portrayal to emphasize the critical role of urban planning in shaping India's future.
