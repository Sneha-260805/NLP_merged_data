{"unnormalised": "In India, the challenges facing urban planners are immense. The country's urban population is projected to reach 675 million by 2035, placing unprecedented strain on existing infrastructure and resources. Issues like traffic congestion, inadequate housing, pollution, and lack of access to basic services are prevalent in many Indian cities, from Delhi to Mumbai. Addressing these challenges requires innovative and context-specific urban planning strategies.", "normalised": "In India, the challenges facing urban planners are immense.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key aspects of urban planning is land-use management. This involves regulating the type and intensity of activities allowed on specific parcels of land. Well-defined zoning regulations, for instance, can prevent the encroachment of residential areas by industrial units, safeguarding public health and safety. Master Plans, typically formulated for a period of 20 years, like the Delhi Master Plan 2021, provide a long-term vision for urban development, outlining strategies for infrastructure development, transportation, and housing. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, represented a significant effort to improve urban governance and infrastructure across Indian cities.", "normalised": "One of the key aspects of urban planning is land-use management.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, effective urban planning must prioritize sustainable transportation solutions. Investing in public transportation systems, such as the Delhi Metro, and promoting non-motorized transport options, like cycling and walking, can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Integrating land use and transportation planning is critical to creating walkable, transit-oriented communities. The smart cities mission, initiated in 2015, aims to leverage technology to improve urban services and infrastructure, including smart mobility solutions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, effective urban planning must prioritize sustainable transportation solutions.

{"unnormalised": "The governance framework for urban planning in India is complex, involving multiple levels of government, from the central to the state and local levels. Effective coordination and collaboration between these different levels are crucial for successful implementation of urban development projects. Public participation is also essential to ensure that urban planning decisions reflect the needs and aspirations of the communities they affect. Public consultations, held on 26/01/2020 regarding the proposed redevelopment of Connaught Place in Delhi, demonstrate the importance of involving citizens in the planning process.", "normalised": "The governance framework for urban planning in India is complex, involving multiple levels of government, from the central to the state and local levels.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest in capacity building for urban planners and strengthen the institutional framework for urban governance. The establishment of specialized training institutions, offering courses on urban planning and management, is crucial. Effective enforcement of planning regulations and transparent decision-making processes are also essential to prevent corruption and ensure accountability. The implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), is a step in the right direction, as it aims to protect the interests of homebuyers and promote transparency in the real estate sector. The deadline for submission of building plans to the MCD is often set at 17:00 hrs on specific dates. A review of the National Urban Policy Framework, post the economic shifts observed since 15/08/1947, is warranted.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest in capacity building for urban planners and strengthen the institutional framework for urban governance.
