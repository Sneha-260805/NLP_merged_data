By prioritizing sustainability, inclusivity, and citizen participation, India can harness the transformative potential of urbanization to create thriving and livable cities for all its citizens. Investments in infrastructure, coupled with robust governance mechanisms and effective public policy, are critical for achieving this vision. For instance, spending Rs. 500 crore on a new metro line in Lucknow could significantly alleviate traffic congestion, but only if implemented with a well-integrated urban plan.", "normalised": "Ultimately, effective urban planning requires a holistic approach that considers the social, economic, and environmental impacts of development.
