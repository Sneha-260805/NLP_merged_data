{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, a core tenet of public policy and governance, plays a crucial role in shaping the sustainable development and livability of cities and towns across India. It encompasses a comprehensive framework for managing land use, infrastructure development, transportation networks, and housing, all aimed at creating equitable, efficient, and resilient urban environments. In India, with its rapidly urbanizing population, effective urban planning is more vital than ever before.", "normalised": "Urban planning, a core tenet of public policy and governance, plays a crucial role in shaping the sustainable development and livability of cities and towns across India.

{"unnormalised": "The role of the Government of India, particularly the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, is central to setting the national agenda for urban planning. Schemes like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the Smart Cities Mission underscore the government's commitment to modernizing urban infrastructure and improving the quality of life for urban residents. These initiatives often involve collaboration with state governments and local municipal corporations, highlighting the importance of multi-level governance in successful urban planning implementation.", "normalised": "The role of the Government of India, particularly the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, is central to setting the national agenda for urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges abound. Rapid and often unplanned urbanization has led to significant strain on existing infrastructure, resulting in issues like traffic congestion, inadequate water supply, and sanitation deficiencies. Moreover, informal settlements and slums, often lacking basic amenities, continue to be a persistent feature of many Indian cities, demonstrating a failure to adequately address the housing needs of vulnerable populations. The effective integration of these informal settlements into the formal urban fabric remains a significant challenge.", "normalised": "Challenges abound.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning necessitates a long-term vision, incorporating data-driven decision-making, participatory planning processes, and a strong focus on environmental sustainability. For instance, the development of a comprehensive master plan for a city like Mumbai should consider future population growth, climate change impacts, and the preservation of green spaces. Public consultations, allowing residents to voice their concerns and contribute to the planning process, are crucial for ensuring that development projects are aligned with the needs and aspirations of the community. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, for example, held extensive consultations between 10:00 hrs and 17:00 hrs on 26/01/2023 regarding proposed changes to its zoning regulations.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning necessitates a long-term vision, incorporating data-driven decision-making, participatory planning processes, and a strong focus on environmental sustainability.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the effective enforcement of building codes and land use regulations is essential for preventing unauthorized construction and ensuring that development occurs in a planned and sustainable manner. Corruption within urban planning agencies and a lack of accountability can undermine even the most well-intentioned plans. The implementation of technology, such as GIS and remote sensing, can enhance the efficiency and transparency of urban planning processes.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the effective enforcement of building codes and land use regulations is essential for preventing unauthorized construction and ensuring that development occurs in a planned and sustainable manner.

{"unnormalised": "Investment in training and capacity building for urban planning professionals is also crucial. Institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) play a vital role in producing skilled planners who can effectively address the complex challenges facing Indian cities. The passage of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) represents a step towards greater transparency and accountability in the real estate sector, which is closely linked to urban planning. The RERA deadline for project registration was originally 30/04/2017.", "normalised": "Investment in training and capacity building for urban planning professionals is also crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Successful urban planning also involves addressing issues of social equity and inclusion. Ensuring access to affordable housing, transportation, and essential services for all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, is paramount. For example, the allocation of resources for the construction of low-income housing units in Delhi under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) aims to address the housing needs of the urban poor. R. K. Narayan's fictional town of Malgudi reflects a simpler, less congested urban landscape, contrasting sharply with the realities of contemporary Indian cities which demand careful urban management. The budget allocated for urban renewal projects in FY 2023-24 was Rs. 75,000 crore. Only with sustained commitment, innovative approaches, and collaborative governance can India's urban areas become truly sustainable, livable, and prosperous spaces for all.", "normalised": "Successful urban planning also involves addressing issues of social equity and inclusion.
