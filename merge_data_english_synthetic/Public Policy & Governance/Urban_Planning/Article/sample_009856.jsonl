{"unnormalised": "Historically, Indian urban planning has evolved from colonial-era master plans to post-independence initiatives focused on industrial development and social welfare. The five-year plans, starting from 1951, included allocations for urban development, albeit often overshadowed by agricultural priorities. However, the liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s and the subsequent surge in migration to urban centres like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru brought the deficiencies in existing urban planning methodologies into sharp focus.", "normalised": "Historically, Indian urban planning has evolved from colonial-era master plans to post-independence initiatives focused on industrial development and social welfare.

{"unnormalised": "Current urban planning initiatives in India aim to address issues such as affordable housing, efficient transportation, sanitation, and environmental sustainability. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, represented a significant effort to modernize urban infrastructure and governance in selected cities. Subsequent initiatives, such as the Smart Cities Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), aim to leverage technology and participatory governance to improve urban living.", "normalised": "Current urban planning initiatives in India aim to address issues such as affordable housing, efficient transportation, sanitation, and environmental sustainability.

The Master Plan for Delhi 2021, for instance, faced criticism for its inability to adequately address the city's burgeoning population and infrastructural needs.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning in India requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, there's a need for robust regulatory frameworks that streamline land use planning and development control. Secondly, investment in public transportation infrastructure, including metro rail projects (like the one in Kolkata that faced delays and finally began services on 24/10/1984) and bus rapid transit systems, is crucial for reducing congestion and improving air quality. Thirdly, affordable housing initiatives, such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, need to be scaled up to address the housing deficit, especially for economically weaker sections. The proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport, originally slated for completion much earlier but now projected to open around 2024, exemplifies the long-term planning horizon often required for large-scale urban infrastructure projects.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning in India requires a multi-pronged approach.

At 17:00 hrs on 15/08/2023, during his Independence Day address, the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of planned urbanization and sustainable development for India's future. Strengthening the capacity of urban local bodies and fostering collaboration between different levels of government are crucial steps in realizing this vision. Addressing the specific challenges faced by cities like Chennai, prone to flooding, and Shimla, struggling with water scarcity, requires tailored solutions and a commitment to long-term sustainability. The effective implementation of these policies will determine whether India can successfully navigate the challenges of urbanization and create inclusive and prosperous cities for all its citizens.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to embrace innovative urban planning approaches, such as Transit-Oriented Development (T O D) and green building technologies, to create sustainable and liveable cities.
