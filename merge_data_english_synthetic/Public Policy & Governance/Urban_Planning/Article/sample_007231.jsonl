{"unnormalised": "India's urban landscape is diverse, ranging from sprawling metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns and rapidly growing peri-urban areas. Each presents unique planning challenges. Master plans, zoning regulations, building codes, and transportation infrastructure development are essential tools employed by urban planners to guide development, manage land use, and address issues such as traffic congestion, inadequate housing, and environmental degradation. The Town and Country Planning Organisation (TCPO), under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, provides guidance and technical assistance to state governments in formulating urban planning policies and programs.", "normalised": "India's urban landscape is diverse, ranging from sprawling metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns and rapidly growing peri-urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is the implementation gap. Despite well-intentioned plans, on-the-ground realities often deviate significantly due to factors such as inadequate enforcement, corruption, and a lack of citizen participation. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, aimed to address these shortcomings by promoting reforms and incentivizing planned development. However, its success was mixed, highlighting the need for more robust monitoring mechanisms and greater accountability.", "normalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is the implementation gap.

{"unnormalised": "Sustainable urban planning is increasingly recognized as a priority. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission seek to leverage technology and innovation to improve urban infrastructure and services, focusing on areas such as waste management, water supply, and public transport. The Swachh Bharat Mission, launched on 02/10/2014, also underscores the importance of sanitation and cleanliness in urban areas. Furthermore, incorporating traditional Indian architectural principles and sustainable practices, such as rainwater harvesting and passive cooling, can contribute to creating climate-resilient cities. For instance, Jaipur’s well-planned city layout from centuries ago showcases indigenous planning prowess.", "normalised": "Sustainable urban planning is increasingly recognized as a priority.
