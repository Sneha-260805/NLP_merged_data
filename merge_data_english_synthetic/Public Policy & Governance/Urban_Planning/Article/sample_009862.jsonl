{"unnormalised": "The Indian context presents unique complexities. Rapid urbanization, driven by rural-urban migration, often outpaces infrastructural development, leading to congested cities, inadequate housing, and strained public services. Planning interventions must therefore consider the existing socio-economic disparities, cultural nuances, and diverse needs of the urban population. For instance, addressing the housing shortage requires not only constructing affordable housing units but also ensuring their accessibility to low-income communities and integrating them into existing urban fabric. The legacy of historical planning, often characterized by top-down approaches, necessitates a shift towards participatory planning that involves citizens, local communities, and civil society organizations in the decision-making process.", "normalised": "The Indian context presents unique complexities.

{"unnormalised": "Key instruments of urban planning in India include master plans, zonal regulations, building codes, and land-use policies. The efficacy of these instruments hinges on robust enforcement mechanisms and effective coordination between various government agencies. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched on 03/12/2005, aimed to address urban infrastructure deficits and promote good governance in cities across India. While the mission had its limitations, it highlighted the importance of integrated urban development strategies. Currently, initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) are focused on improving basic urban services, such as water supply, sewerage, and urban transport.", "normalised": "Key instruments of urban planning in India include master plans, zonal regulations, building codes, and land-use policies.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges persist. Land acquisition processes remain cumbersome, often delaying infrastructure projects. Informal settlements continue to proliferate, posing challenges to urban governance and service delivery. Skill gaps in urban planning professionals, coupled with inadequate resources allocated to urban planning departments, further hinder effective implementation. The digitization of land records and the adoption of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are crucial for improving transparency and efficiency in urban planning processes. The National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) in Delhi plays a significant role in conducting research, providing training, and promoting knowledge sharing in the field of urban planning.", "normalised": "Challenges persist.

Sustainable urban development must prioritize resource efficiency, promote renewable energy sources, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2023 witnessed discussions focused on \"Climate Resilient Urban Infrastructure\" during a seminar at IIT Bombay. Furthermore, inclusive urban planning must address the needs of vulnerable populations, including women, children, and persons with disabilities. Strengthening urban governance, enhancing institutional capacity, and promoting participatory planning are essential for building resilient and livable cities for all. The next iteration of the National Urban Policy, expected after the 15/08/2024 General Elections, is anticipated to incorporate lessons learned and outline a forward-looking vision for urban development in India.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning in India requires a multi-pronged approach that integrates environmental considerations, promotes social equity, and fosters economic growth.
