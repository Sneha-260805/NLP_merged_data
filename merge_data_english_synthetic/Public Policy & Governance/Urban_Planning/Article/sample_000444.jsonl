{"unnormalised": "In India, the challenges of urban planning are manifold. Rapid population growth, driven by rural-urban migration, puts immense pressure on existing infrastructure and resources. Many Indian cities grapple with issues like inadequate housing, traffic congestion, pollution, and lack of access to basic services like clean water and sanitation. Informal settlements, often lacking proper planning and infrastructure, house a significant portion of the urban population, particularly in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi.", "normalised": "In India, the challenges of urban planning are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, represented a significant effort to address urban challenges through targeted investments in infrastructure and governance reforms. While JNNURM achieved some successes, its implementation also revealed the complexities of urban governance in India, including issues of coordination between different levels of government and capacity constraints within local bodies. The subsequent Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) builds upon JNNURM’s legacy, focusing on providing basic services to households and building amenities in cities.", "normalised": "The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (J N N U R M), launched in two thousand and five, represented a significant effort to address urban challenges through targeted investments in infrastructure and governance reforms.

{"unnormalised": "Public policy interventions in urban planning require a multi-pronged strategy. First, strengthening local governance is crucial. Municipal corporations need to be empowered with adequate financial resources and technical expertise to effectively plan and manage urban development. Second, innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships (PPPs), are needed to attract investment in urban infrastructure projects. Third, incorporating community participation in the planning process is essential to ensure that development projects are aligned with the needs and aspirations of local residents. Ignoring such community voices, as depicted subtly in certain Bollywood films exploring urban displacement, can lead to project failures and social unrest.", "normalised": "Public policy interventions in urban planning require a multi-pronged strategy.

These tools can help to monitor urban growth patterns, identify areas of vulnerability, and optimize resource allocation. For instance, using GIS, town planners can map areas prone to flooding in Chennai and design appropriate mitigation measures.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the use of technology, such as Geographic Information Systems (G I S) and data analytics, can significantly improve urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, promoting sustainable urban development is paramount. This includes investing in renewable energy sources, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and encouraging the use of public transportation. Integrating green spaces and preserving natural resources within urban areas is also crucial for enhancing the quality of life and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Addressing the challenge of solid waste management, which costs municipalities thousands of Rs. per day, requires a systemic change. A well-structured urban planning initiative requires at least 50 dedicated employees and approximately 10 km of dedicated routes for waste removal.", "normalised": "Finally, promoting sustainable urban development is paramount.
