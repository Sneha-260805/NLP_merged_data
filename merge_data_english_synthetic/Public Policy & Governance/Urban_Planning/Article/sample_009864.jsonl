{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a critical facet of public policy and governance, intricately shaping the socio-economic fabric of the nation. It encompasses the systematic development and management of urban spaces, aiming to create sustainable, equitable, and efficient environments for its citizens. With a rapidly growing urban population, predicted to reach over 675 million by 2035, effective urban planning is paramount to address challenges like housing shortages, infrastructure deficits, and environmental degradation.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a critical facet of public policy and governance, intricately shaping the socio-economic fabric of the nation.

{"unnormalised": "The historical context reveals a significant shift post-independence. Early efforts, inspired by Pandit Nehru's vision, focused on planned industrial cities like Chandigarh and Bhilai. However, the subsequent decades witnessed unplanned urban sprawl, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III cities. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 aimed to decentralize urban governance, empowering Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) like Municipal Corporations and Nagar Panchayats. This amendment mandated the formation of District Planning Committees (DPCs) to integrate urban and rural planning efforts.", "normalised": "The historical context reveals a significant shift post-independence.

{"unnormalised": "Currently, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) plays a pivotal role in formulating national policies and programs related to urban development. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) seek to improve urban infrastructure and service delivery. These programs often involve Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to mobilize resources and expertise. For instance, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link, costing approximately Rs. 17,843 crore, is a prime example of infrastructure development through PPP.", "normalised": "Currently, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (M O H U A) plays a pivotal role in formulating national policies and programs related to urban development.

The complex web of regulations and bureaucratic processes further impedes efficient implementation. The scarcity of skilled urban planners and adequate funding for ULBs also contributes to the problem. Furthermore, incorporating informal settlements and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations within the urban planning framework requires focused attention.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, India needs to embrace innovative approaches to urban planning. This includes leveraging technology, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for better data-driven decision-making. Integrating climate resilience into urban development plans is crucial, considering the increasing vulnerability of Indian cities to extreme weather events. Citizen participation and community engagement should be at the heart of the planning process, ensuring that development aligns with the needs and aspirations of the people. For example, participatory budgeting initiatives in Pune have shown promising results.", "normalised": "Moving forward, India needs to embrace innovative approaches to urban planning.
