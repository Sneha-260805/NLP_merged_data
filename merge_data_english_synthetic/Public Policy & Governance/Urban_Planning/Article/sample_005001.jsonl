{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, in the context of Indian public policy and governance, represents a multifaceted approach to managing and shaping the physical growth and development of urban areas. It's a crucial element in ensuring sustainable, equitable, and efficient cities capable of supporting a rapidly growing population. The discipline encompasses land use zoning, infrastructure development, transportation planning, housing provision, and environmental management, all guided by comprehensive plans and regulatory frameworks.", "normalised": "Urban planning, in the context of Indian public policy and governance, represents a multifaceted approach to managing and shaping the physical growth and development of urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "The relevance of robust urban planning is amplified in India, given its burgeoning urban population and the associated challenges of congestion, pollution, and inadequate housing. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 aimed to decentralize urban governance and empower local bodies (Municipalities) to undertake planned development. However, effective implementation remains a challenge due to capacity constraints, lack of adequate funding, and inter-departmental coordination issues.", "normalised": "The relevance of robust urban planning is amplified in India, given its burgeoning urban population and the associated challenges of congestion, pollution, and inadequate housing.

{"unnormalised": "Key challenges include managing the growth of informal settlements, addressing the housing deficit for low-income groups, and improving public transportation systems. Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru face immense pressure on existing infrastructure and resources. Smart City Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, represents a significant initiative to leverage technology and innovation to enhance urban infrastructure and services. However, its impact has been varied, with some cities showing more progress than others.", "normalised": "Key challenges include managing the growth of informal settlements, addressing the housing deficit for low-income groups, and improving public transportation systems.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, traditional urban planning approaches often struggle to incorporate the unique socio-cultural context of Indian cities. Plans often fail to adequately address the needs of marginalized communities, perpetuating existing inequalities. A more inclusive and participatory approach is needed, involving community consultations and incorporating local knowledge into the planning process. This includes preserving heritage sites and traditional markets like Chandni Chowk in Delhi, which are integral to the city's character.", "normalised": "Furthermore, traditional urban planning approaches often struggle to incorporate the unique socio-cultural context of Indian cities.

{"unnormalised": "Sustainable urban development, as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), requires a shift towards compact, walkable, and transit-oriented development patterns. This necessitates investments in public transportation infrastructure, such as metro rail projects and bus rapid transit systems, and disincentivizing private vehicle use. The completion of the Delhi Metro Phase IV project, expected by 31/12/2025, is a significant step in this direction.", "normalised": "Sustainable urban development, as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals (S D Gs), requires a shift towards compact, walkable, and transit-oriented development patterns.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, financing urban infrastructure development is a critical challenge. Municipalities often rely on limited sources of revenue and struggle to attract private sector investment. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as land value capture and municipal bonds, need to be explored to bridge the infrastructure gap. For instance, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's successful issuance of municipal bonds demonstrates the potential of this approach.", "normalised": "Moreover, financing urban infrastructure development is a critical challenge.
