{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning in India necessitates a multi-faceted strategy encompassing land-use regulation, transportation planning, housing policy, and environmental management. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, served as a major initiative to address urban infrastructure deficiencies across 65 cities, injecting significant funds for projects ranging from water supply to sanitation and transportation. While JNNURM achieved considerable progress, subsequent programs like AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) focus on sustainable urban development by emphasizing water supply, sewerage, and urban transport.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning in India necessitates a multi-faceted strategy encompassing land-use regulation, transportation planning, housing policy, and environmental management.

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aims to provide \"Housing for All\" by 2022, targeting the economically weaker sections and low-income groups. However, the program faces challenges related to land availability, construction costs, and bureaucratic hurdles, highlighting the need for innovative approaches such as public-private partnerships and the adoption of cost-effective building technologies.", "normalised": "A key aspect of urban planning in India is addressing the issue of affordable housing.
