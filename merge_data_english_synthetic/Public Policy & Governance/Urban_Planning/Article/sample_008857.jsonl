{"unnormalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a vital facet of public policy and governance, particularly given the nation's rapid urbanization and its attendant challenges. Effective urban planning aims to optimize resource allocation, enhance quality of life, and foster sustainable development within burgeoning cities and metropolitan areas. It encompasses a broad range of interventions, from land-use zoning and infrastructure development to transportation management and affordable housing initiatives.", "normalised": "Urban planning in India constitutes a vital facet of public policy and governance, particularly given the nation's rapid urbanization and its attendant challenges.

Land acquisition remains a persistent challenge, often delayed by bureaucratic processes and resistance from landowners. Informal settlements, prevalent across Indian cities, pose complex planning dilemmas, demanding innovative approaches that balance regularization with planned urban development. The need for robust data collection and analysis is also crucial, ensuring that planning decisions are informed by evidence and responsive to the evolving needs of the urban population.", "normalised": "However, successful implementation requires overcoming several hurdles.

Public consultations, community engagement forums, and participatory budgeting initiatives can help ensure that urban plans are aligned with the needs and aspirations of the people they are intended to serve. The romanticized yet flawed portrayal of city planning gone awry in films like \"Wake Up Sid\" (though focused more on personal growth) offers a glimpse into the everyday frustrations and disconnects experienced by residents in rapidly evolving urban environments.", "normalised": "The planning process itself must become more inclusive and participatory, incorporating the voices of all stakeholders, particularly marginalized communities.
