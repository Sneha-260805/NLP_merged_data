{"unnormalised": "In the context of India, urban planning faces unique challenges. The sheer scale of urbanization, coupled with limited resources and pre-existing infrastructure deficits, requires innovative and context-specific solutions. Consider the case of Mumbai, a city grappling with high population density and inadequate housing. Strategic urban planning interventions are crucial for addressing these issues, including the development of affordable housing schemes and improvements to public transportation networks like the Mumbai local trains.", "normalised": "In the context of India, urban planning faces unique challenges.

The mission focused on improving infrastructure, governance, and service delivery in select cities. While JNNURM has been succeeded by other initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), the lessons learned from its implementation continue to inform urban planning practices in India. The deadline for certain JNNURM projects was 31/03/2017, highlighting the time-bound nature of these interventions.", "normalised": "The J N N U R M, launched in two thousand and five, represented a significant effort to address urban challenges across the country.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning necessitates robust regulatory frameworks. State Town and Country Planning Acts provide the legal basis for land use planning and development control. However, enforcement remains a significant challenge. Illegal constructions and unauthorized development are rampant in many Indian cities, undermining the effectiveness of planning efforts.
