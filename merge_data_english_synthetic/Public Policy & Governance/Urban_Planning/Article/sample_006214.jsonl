Land acquisition issues, funding constraints, lack of skilled professionals, and inadequate enforcement of regulations often hinder progress. Moreover, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including various government agencies, private developers, and community groups, requires effective coordination and communication to ensure successful outcomes. The legacy of unplanned growth, evident in many Indian cities, further complicates the task of retrofitting infrastructure and addressing existing deficiencies.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of urban planning initiatives faces significant challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Successful urban planning necessitates a long-term vision that considers the needs of future generations. It requires a participatory approach, involving citizens in the decision-making process to ensure that their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed. Investing in public transportation, promoting affordable housing, protecting green spaces, and managing waste effectively are all crucial components of a comprehensive urban planning strategy. Integrating traditional knowledge and cultural values into urban design can also enhance the sense of place and identity within cities. For instance, incorporating traditional rainwater harvesting techniques can contribute to water conservation efforts. Allocating sufficient resources, say Rs. 500 Crores for a particular region like the NCR region, and implementing transparent and accountable governance mechanisms are also paramount for ensuring the effective implementation of urban planning policies and achieving sustainable urban development goals across India’s 3.287 million sq km.", "normalised": "Successful urban planning necessitates a long-term vision that considers the needs of future generations.
