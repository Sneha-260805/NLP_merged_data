{"unnormalised": "India's urban centers are experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by factors such as rural-urban migration and economic opportunities. This growth puts immense pressure on existing infrastructure, housing, and public services. Effective urban planning is paramount to mitigating these challenges and fostering inclusive and resilient cities.

{"unnormalised": "A key aspect of urban planning is the development of comprehensive master plans. These plans serve as blueprints for future development, outlining land use patterns, transportation networks, and infrastructure projects. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), for instance, plays a significant role in planning and implementing infrastructure projects in the Mumbai metropolitan area. Similarly, state-level town and country planning departments are responsible for preparing and enforcing development regulations.", "normalised": "A key aspect of urban planning is the development of comprehensive master plans.

Furthermore, a lack of community participation and inadequate enforcement mechanisms can undermine the effectiveness of planning efforts. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, passed in 1992, aimed to empower Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and enhance citizen participation, but its implementation has been uneven across different states.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of urban plans often faces hurdles.

The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other technologies can enhance planning and decision-making. Moreover, incorporating local knowledge and engaging with communities are crucial to ensuring that urban plans are responsive to the needs and aspirations of citizens. Achieving well-planned, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector, and civil society organizations.
