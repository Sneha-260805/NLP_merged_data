{"unnormalised": "The history of urban planning in India can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Indus Valley Civilization, renowned for its meticulously planned cities like Mohenjo-daro. However, modern urban planning practices were largely introduced during the British colonial era, with the establishment of town planning departments in major cities. Post-independence, the focus shifted to addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization and industrialization. The First Five-Year Plan (1951-1956) recognized the importance of planned urban development, and subsequent plans have consistently emphasized the need for improved infrastructure, affordable housing, and environmental management in urban areas.", "normalised": "The history of urban planning in India can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Indus Valley Civilization, renowned for its meticulously planned cities like Mohenjo-daro.

{"unnormalised": "Key legislation governing urban planning in India includes the Town and Country Planning Acts enacted by various state governments. These acts provide the legal framework for preparing and implementing development plans, regulating land use, and controlling building activities. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 further decentralized urban governance, empowering Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) like Municipal Corporations and Municipalities to play a more significant role in planning and development.", "normalised": "Key legislation governing urban planning in India includes the Town and Country Planning Acts enacted by various state governments.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these efforts, Indian cities face numerous challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and a shortage of affordable housing. The proliferation of slums and informal settlements poses a significant problem, highlighting the need for inclusive and participatory planning processes. Government initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) aim to address these challenges by promoting sustainable urban development, improving infrastructure, and enhancing citizen services. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), operational between 2005 and 2014, previously invested heavily in urban infrastructure upgrades.", "normalised": "Despite these efforts, Indian cities face numerous challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and a shortage of affordable housing.

{"unnormalised": "A major challenge in India's urban planning is the effective implementation of plans. Often, the visions laid out in Master Plans remain unrealized due to bureaucratic delays, lack of coordination between various government agencies, and financial constraints. The role of private developers and real estate companies also needs to be carefully managed to ensure that development projects align with the overall goals of sustainable urban development. For instance, the Bandra-Worli Sea Link project in Mumbai, completed on 30/06/2009 after facing delays, underscores the complexities of large-scale urban infrastructure projects.", "normalised": "A major challenge in India's urban planning is the effective implementation of plans.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India must embrace innovation and technology. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and data analytics can help planners make informed decisions and monitor the progress of development projects. Furthermore, promoting sustainable transportation options, such as public transit and cycling, is essential for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. For example, Namma Metro in Bangalore has eased traffic for several citizens since operations commenced at 09:00 hrs on 20/10/2011.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India must embrace innovation and technology.

Innovative construction technologies and financing mechanisms are needed to provide affordable housing options for all citizens. Ultimately, effective urban planning is essential for creating livable, sustainable, and equitable cities that contribute to the overall prosperity and well-being of India. The cost of housing units is estimated to be around Rs. 5 lakh for EWS category in many government schemes.", "normalised": "Addressing the housing deficit, particularly for low-income groups, remains a priority.
