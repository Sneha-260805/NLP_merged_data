{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, a critical subfield of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic landscape of India. With a rapidly urbanizing population, projected to reach over 675 million by 2035 (according to UN estimates), effective urban planning is paramount to managing growth, ensuring sustainable development, and improving the quality of life for all citizens.

{"unnormalised": "India's urban planning challenges are multifaceted. Rapid, often unplanned, urbanization has led to problems such as inadequate infrastructure, sprawling slums, traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and social inequalities. Traditional approaches to urban planning, often top-down and inflexible, have struggled to keep pace with the dynamic needs of growing cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. The legacy of the British Town and Country Planning Act of 1947, while influential, needs significant adaptation to suit the contemporary Indian context.", "normalised": "India's urban planning challenges are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, represented a significant effort to address these challenges through reforms in urban governance and infrastructure development. However, its impact has been mixed, with challenges in implementation and sustainability. More recently, the Smart Cities Mission aims to leverage technology and innovation to create citizen-centric and sustainable urban environments. Projects under this mission, such as the integrated command and control centers in various cities, demonstrate the potential of technology to improve urban management.", "normalised": "The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (J N N U R M), launched in two thousand and five, represented a significant effort to address these challenges through reforms in urban governance and infrastructure development.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, robust regulatory frameworks are essential to guide land use and development. These frameworks need to be flexible enough to accommodate changing needs while also protecting environmental and social interests. Secondly, investment in infrastructure, including transportation, water supply, and sanitation, is crucial. The development of metro rail networks in cities like Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai has significantly improved urban mobility, but more needs to be done to address the needs of pedestrians and cyclists.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-pronged approach.

Engaging citizens in the planning process is crucial for ensuring that plans are responsive to local needs and priorities. Decentralization of decision-making power to local governments can also enhance the effectiveness of urban planning. Investing Rs. 500 crores in localized initiatives would significantly boost grass root level progress. Addressing the challenge of 10 km wide traffic congestions in metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi requires inter-departmental collaboration and innovative solutions.", "normalised": "Finally, effective urban planning requires strong political will and public participation.
