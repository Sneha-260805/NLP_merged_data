{"unnormalised": "However, effective implementation remains a challenge. Many Indian cities struggle with issues such as inadequate infrastructure, traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and lack of affordable housing. These challenges are often exacerbated by weak enforcement of building codes, inadequate coordination among different government agencies, and insufficient public participation in the planning process. The complexities are depicted vividly in Bollywood films like \"Wake Up Sid,\" showing the stark contrast between planned Mumbai and the struggles of its less privileged inhabitants.", "normalised": "However, effective implementation remains a challenge.

{"unnormalised": "The development of Navi Mumbai, envisioned by CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra), serves as a case study in planned urban development. While it aimed to decongest Mumbai and provide affordable housing, its success remains debatable, highlighting the need for continuous evaluation and adaptation in urban planning strategies. Moreover, the rapid and often unplanned growth of cities like Bangalore and Gurgaon exemplifies the consequences of neglecting comprehensive urban planning, leading to infrastructural bottlenecks and environmental degradation. Land acquisition issues often hamper projects leading to protests and legal battles.", "normalised": "The development of Navi Mumbai, envisioned by C I D C O (City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra), serves as a case study in planned urban development.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, a more integrated and participatory approach to urban planning is crucial. This includes strengthening local governance, empowering urban local bodies, promoting public-private partnerships, leveraging technology for efficient urban management, and ensuring inclusive and equitable access to urban services for all segments of society. Investment in training urban planners and professionals at institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) is also essential for building capacity and expertise. The allocation of adequate financial resources, perhaps with increased budgetary allocation of, say, Rs. 50000 crore annually by the central government, is also critical for successful implementation of urban development plans. By adopting a holistic and forward-looking approach, India can transform its cities into engines of economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability.", "normalised": "Moving forward, a more integrated and participatory approach to urban planning is crucial.
