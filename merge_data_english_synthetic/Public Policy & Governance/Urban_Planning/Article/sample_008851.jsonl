{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges facing Indian urban planning is the rapid and often unplanned growth of cities. This leads to issues such as inadequate infrastructure, housing shortages, traffic congestion, pollution, and social inequality. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates land use planning, transportation planning, infrastructure development, and environmental management. Master Plans, often envisioned for 20-year horizons, such as those proposed for Navi Mumbai, aim to guide this development.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges facing Indian urban planning is the rapid and often unplanned growth of cities.

{"unnormalised": "The role of governance is paramount in ensuring successful urban planning. Effective implementation requires strong political will, transparent decision-making processes, and active citizen participation. The involvement of local communities in the planning process is crucial to ensure that plans are responsive to their needs and aspirations. Institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, play a significant role in training professionals and conducting research to advance the field.", "normalised": "The role of governance is paramount in ensuring successful urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Public policy must provide a supportive framework for urban planning. This includes enacting appropriate legislation, allocating sufficient resources, and fostering collaboration between different government agencies and stakeholders. For example, schemes like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the Smart Cities Mission aim to improve urban infrastructure and services in Indian cities. The financial allocations for these schemes, often running into thousands of crores of Rupees, underscore the government's commitment to urban development.", "normalised": "Public policy must provide a supportive framework for urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must address the specific needs of different segments of the population, particularly the poor and marginalized. This requires a focus on providing affordable housing, access to basic services, and economic opportunities for all. The concept of \"inclusive cities\" is gaining traction, emphasizing the need to create urban spaces that are accessible and welcoming to everyone, irrespective of their socio-economic background.", "normalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must address the specific needs of different segments of the population, particularly the poor and marginalized.

{"unnormalised": "Even popular culture acknowledges these issues. The portrayal of urban decay and social inequality in films like \"Slumdog Millionaire\" highlights the challenges faced by many urban residents in India. This underscores the urgent need for effective urban planning and governance to create more equitable and sustainable cities for all. Consider also the urban sprawl depicted around cities like Gurgaon and Bangalore, often a stark contrast to planned sectors only kilometers away. The price of land per square foot can vary by orders of magnitude depending on planning permissions and accessibility. Ultimately, effective urban planning is not just about building cities, but about building a better future for India.", "normalised": "Even popular culture acknowledges these issues.
