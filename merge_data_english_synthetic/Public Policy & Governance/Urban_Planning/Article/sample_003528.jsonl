{"unnormalised": "Challenges to effective urban planning in India are numerous. Land acquisition issues, inadequate funding, weak enforcement mechanisms, and a lack of skilled professionals are common hurdles. Furthermore, rapid and often unplanned urbanization strains existing infrastructure and services, leading to overcrowding and environmental degradation. For example, cities like Mumbai and Delhi face immense pressure on resources like water and electricity.", "normalised": "Challenges to effective urban planning in India are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires a participatory approach, involving citizens, experts, and policymakers in the decision-making process. Public consultations, stakeholder meetings, and online forums can help gather valuable input and ensure that urban plans reflect the needs and aspirations of the community. The concept of “inclusive planning” ensures that vulnerable populations, such as slum dwellers and marginalized communities, are not left behind.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning requires a participatory approach, involving citizens, experts, and policymakers in the decision-making process.

{"unnormalised": "Recent trends in urban planning in India include a focus on sustainable development, green buildings, and transit-oriented development (TOD). Green buildings, certified by organizations like GRIHA, are becoming increasingly popular, reducing energy consumption and promoting environmentally friendly practices. TOD promotes the development of compact, walkable neighborhoods around public transportation hubs, reducing reliance on private vehicles. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam's vision of self-reliant and sustainable cities continues to inspire urban planners.", "normalised": "Recent trends in urban planning in India include a focus on sustainable development, green buildings, and transit-oriented development (T O D).

{"unnormalised": "Innovative technologies are also playing a significant role in modern urban planning. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to map and analyze urban data, while Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used to design and manage buildings and infrastructure. These technologies can help planners make informed decisions and optimize resource allocation. The cost of housing in areas like Bandra, Mumbai, can be exorbitant, reaching Rs. 50,000 per sq ft, highlighting the need for affordable housing strategies.", "normalised": "Innovative technologies are also playing a significant role in modern urban planning.
