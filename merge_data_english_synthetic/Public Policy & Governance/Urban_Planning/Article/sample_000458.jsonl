{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing land use zoning, transportation planning, infrastructure development, and environmental management. It necessitates a holistic vision that integrates these elements to create a cohesive and functional urban ecosystem. Challenges abound, including rapid population growth, inadequate infrastructure, informal settlements, and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges requires strong governance, effective implementation of policies, and active citizen participation.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing land use zoning, transportation planning, infrastructure development, and environmental management.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, environmental sustainability must be at the core of urban planning initiatives. Promoting green infrastructure, managing water resources efficiently, and reducing carbon emissions are essential for creating environmentally resilient cities. Initiatives like rainwater harvesting, waste management plants, and the promotion of renewable energy sources can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability. Investments of Rs. 500 crores in green infrastructure projects in Bangalore could significantly improve air quality and water management. Developing 100 km of cycle tracks across Chennai would promote non-motorized transport.", "normalised": "Furthermore, environmental sustainability must be at the core of urban planning initiatives. Promoting green infrastructure, managing water resources efficiently, and reducing carbon emissions are essential for creating environmentally resilient cities. Initiatives like rainwater harvesting, waste management plants, and the promotion of renewable energy sources can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.
