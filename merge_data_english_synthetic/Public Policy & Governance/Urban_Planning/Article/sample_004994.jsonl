{"unnormalised": "The core objective of urban planning is to create functional, livable, and resilient cities. This necessitates a multi-faceted approach encompassing land use regulation, infrastructure development (roads, water supply, sanitation, and public transportation), environmental management, and affordable housing provision. Historically, Indian urban planning has been influenced by colonial legacies and post-independence developmental models. The Town and Country Planning Organisation (TCPO), established in 1962, has played a pivotal role in formulating national policies and guidelines.", "normalised": "The core objective of urban planning is to create functional, livable, and resilient cities.

{"unnormalised": "However, implementation often faces significant hurdles. One major challenge is the fragmented governance structure. Multiple agencies, including municipal corporations, development authorities (like the Delhi Development Authority, DDA), and state government departments, often operate in silos, leading to overlaps, inefficiencies, and a lack of coordinated action. This complexity is further exacerbated by the rapid pace of urbanization, which outstrips the capacity of existing planning frameworks.", "normalised": "However, implementation often faces significant hurdles.

The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LARR Act) aims to provide fair compensation and rehabilitation to displaced populations.

{"unnormalised": "Informal settlements, or slums, represent another critical challenge. These settlements, often lacking basic amenities and located in hazardous areas, are home to a significant portion of the urban poor. Slum redevelopment programs, such as the Rajiv Awas Yojana, have aimed to provide affordable housing and improve living conditions. However, their success has been limited by factors such as inadequate funding, lack of community participation, and bureaucratic hurdles.", "normalised": "Informal settlements, or slums, represent another critical challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires robust data collection and analysis, including the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other technologies. The Smart Cities Mission, launched on 25/06/2015, emphasizes the use of technology to improve urban services and citizen engagement.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to adopt a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning. This includes strengthening governance structures, streamlining land acquisition processes, promoting affordable housing, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and fostering community participation. The success of urban planning will ultimately depend on the ability of policymakers and planners to navigate the complex challenges and create cities that are both economically vibrant and socially inclusive. Addressing issues like water scarcity, given the critical time of 13:00 hrs in Chennai on any given summer day, are also crucial. The need for skilled urban planners and investments in training programmes at institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) is also paramount.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to adopt a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning.
