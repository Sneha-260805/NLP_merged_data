{"unnormalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is addressing the issue of informal settlements and slums, which house a significant portion of the urban population. These areas often lack basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and proper housing, leading to health risks and social inequalities. Innovative solutions, such as in-situ slum redevelopment and affordable housing schemes, are necessary to address this challenge and provide dignified living conditions for all. The Rajiv Awas Yojana, for instance, aimed to provide financial assistance for slum redevelopment projects.", "normalised": "A key challenge in Indian urban planning is addressing the issue of informal settlements and slums, which house a significant portion of the urban population.

Inspired by the principles of Vastu Shastra, some urban planners advocate for designs that harmonize with nature and promote well-being. Furthermore, the principles of Gandhi’s Gram Swaraj, emphasizing self-sufficient village communities, offer valuable lessons for decentralised urban development.", "normalised": "Moreover, integrating traditional knowledge and local context into urban planning is crucial for creating sustainable and culturally sensitive urban environments.

This can be facilitated through public consultations, participatory planning workshops, and the use of technology to gather feedback and suggestions from citizens.
