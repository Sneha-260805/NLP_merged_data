{"unnormalised": "The objectives of urban planning in India are multifaceted. They encompass land use zoning, transportation network design, housing provision, environmental conservation, and the creation of vibrant public spaces. A well-defined urban plan serves as a roadmap for orderly development, guiding both public and private investment decisions. In cities like Mumbai and Delhi, where land is a scarce commodity, comprehensive planning is essential to optimize its utilization and prevent haphazard construction.", "normalised": "The objectives of urban planning in India are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "However, the implementation of urban plans in India faces numerous challenges. One significant hurdle is the lack of coordination between different government agencies. Often, various departments operate in silos, leading to conflicting policies and inefficient resource allocation. For example, the water supply department might plan infrastructure improvements without considering the concurrent road expansion projects by the municipal corporation, resulting in repeated disruptions and increased costs. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched on 03/12/2005, aimed to address this issue by promoting integrated planning and development across urban areas.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of urban plans in India faces numerous challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, citizen participation in the planning process is often limited. While the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Ward Committees to facilitate local governance, their effectiveness in influencing urban plans remains questionable. Engaging citizens in meaningful consultations and incorporating their feedback is crucial to ensure that plans are responsive to the needs and aspirations of the community. Consider the ongoing debate regarding the Coastal Road project in Mumbai, where concerns about environmental impact and displacement of fisherfolk necessitate a more inclusive planning approach. A review meeting is scheduled on 27/10/2024 at 14:00 hrs to discuss the socio-economic impact assessment.", "normalised": "Furthermore, citizen participation in the planning process is often limited.

Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency often undermine enforcement efforts, leading to the proliferation of slums and informal settlements. Leveraging technology, such as GIS mapping and drone surveillance, can enhance monitoring and enforcement capabilities.", "normalised": "Moreover, effective enforcement of building regulations and zoning laws is critical to prevent unauthorized construction and ensure compliance with planning norms.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the emphasis should be on developing smart and sustainable cities that prioritize environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic growth. The Smart Cities Mission, initiated in 2015, aims to transform 100 Indian cities through technological interventions and citizen-centric urban planning. This includes initiatives like intelligent traffic management systems, waste management solutions, and affordable housing projects. Investment in urban infrastructure is paramount. The estimated cost for upgrading urban infrastructure in the next five years is Rs. 5 lakh crore. It is also imperative to strengthen the capacity of urban local bodies to effectively manage and implement urban plans. Continuous training and skill development programs for urban planners and administrators are essential to equip them with the knowledge and tools necessary to address the evolving challenges of urban governance in India. The next training session is scheduled on 15/07/2024 at the National Institute of Urban Affairs.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the emphasis should be on developing smart and sustainable cities that prioritize environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic growth.
