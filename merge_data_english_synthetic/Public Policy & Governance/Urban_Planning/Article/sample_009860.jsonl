{"unnormalised": "The core objective of urban planning in the Indian context is to guide urban growth in a coordinated and integrated manner. This necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating elements of engineering, architecture, social sciences, and environmental management. Policies formulated at the national level, such as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), implemented since 2015, provide a framework for urban development, focusing on water supply, sewerage, and urban transport. State governments then adapt these policies to suit their specific needs and resources.", "normalised": "The core objective of urban planning in the Indian context is to guide urban growth in a coordinated and integrated manner.

{"unnormalised": "A key aspect of urban planning in India is addressing the housing deficit, particularly for the economically weaker sections. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aim to provide affordable housing to all by 2022, a deadline which now appears increasingly challenging. However, the effective implementation of such schemes hinges on meticulous urban planning, ensuring that new housing developments are well-integrated with existing infrastructure and employment opportunities. Often, detailed project reports (DPRs) are submitted and approved before implementation.", "normalised": "A key aspect of urban planning in India is addressing the housing deficit, particularly for the economically weaker sections.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, transportation infrastructure plays a vital role in shaping urban landscapes. Investments in metro rail projects in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru are aimed at reducing traffic congestion and improving connectivity. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link, inaugurated on 12/01/2024, exemplifies large-scale infrastructure projects transforming urban mobility. But alongside these ambitious projects, attention must be given to pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, cycling lanes, and efficient public transport systems to create truly sustainable cities.", "normalised": "Furthermore, transportation infrastructure plays a vital role in shaping urban landscapes.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, environmental considerations are becoming increasingly central to urban planning in India. With increasing concerns about air and water pollution, urban planners are tasked with integrating green spaces, promoting renewable energy sources, and implementing waste management strategies. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, targets a 20-30% reduction in particulate matter concentrations by 2024 in identified cities.", "normalised": "Moreover, environmental considerations are becoming increasingly central to urban planning in India.

{"unnormalised": "Effective governance is crucial for successful urban planning. This involves transparent decision-making processes, public participation, and accountability. Local bodies, such as municipal corporations and urban local bodies (ULBs), play a crucial role in implementing urban plans at the grassroots level. Capacity building of urban planners and officials is also essential to ensure they possess the necessary skills and knowledge to address the complex challenges of urban development. Many local government offices open at 09:30 hrs and are heavily involved in implementing urban plans.", "normalised": "Effective governance is crucial for successful urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, including land acquisition issues, funding constraints, and a lack of integrated planning across different government departments. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, passed on 22/12/1992, aimed to empower ULBs, but its full potential is yet to be realized. Moreover, the rapid pace of urbanization often outstrips the capacity of urban planners to respond effectively.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, including land acquisition issues, funding constraints, and a lack of integrated planning across different government departments.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, India needs a more proactive and visionary approach to urban planning. This requires embracing innovative technologies, promoting sustainable development practices, and fostering greater collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society. Investing in research and development, particularly in areas like smart cities and urban resilience, is crucial for shaping the future of India's urban landscape. The allocation of Rs. 10,000 crore towards urban development in the recent budget demonstrates the government's commitment to this sector.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs a more proactive and visionary approach to urban planning.
