{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, as a critical facet of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic landscape of India. With a rapidly expanding urban population and increasing pressure on existing infrastructure, effective urban planning strategies are essential for fostering sustainable and equitable growth. These strategies encompass a wide range of considerations, from land use regulations and transportation networks to housing policies and environmental protection.", "normalised": "Urban planning, as a critical facet of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic landscape of India.

{"unnormalised": "In India, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is the apex body responsible for formulating policies and programs related to urban development. Initiatives such as the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) reflect the government's commitment to modernizing urban infrastructure and improving the quality of life for urban residents. However, the implementation of these initiatives often faces challenges related to land acquisition, resource mobilization, and inter-departmental coordination.", "normalised": "In India, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (M O H U A) is the apex body responsible for formulating policies and programs related to urban development.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning requires a holistic approach, integrating diverse perspectives and incorporating the needs of all stakeholders. This includes engaging with local communities, understanding their socio-cultural context, and ensuring that development projects are sensitive to their concerns. The complexities inherent in urban environments necessitate the adoption of data-driven decision-making processes and the utilization of advanced technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial planning and analysis.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning requires a holistic approach, integrating diverse perspectives and incorporating the needs of all stakeholders.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges in Indian urban planning is addressing the issue of affordable housing. Millions of urban dwellers, particularly those belonging to economically weaker sections, lack access to adequate housing. Policies aimed at promoting affordable housing, such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), are crucial for ensuring inclusive urban development. Furthermore, addressing the informal sector and providing them with secure livelihoods is also a critical aspect.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges in Indian urban planning is addressing the issue of affordable housing.

{"unnormalised": "The development of efficient and sustainable transportation systems is another crucial element of urban planning. Congestion, pollution, and inadequate public transport plague many Indian cities. Investing in public transportation infrastructure, promoting non-motorized transport options, and implementing intelligent traffic management systems are essential for alleviating these problems. Mumbai, for instance, has seen significant improvements in its public transport system with the introduction of the Mumbai Metro, albeit with challenges related to construction delays and cost overruns.", "normalised": "The development of efficient and sustainable transportation systems is another crucial element of urban planning.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must also address environmental concerns. Cities are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and face increasing risks from climate change. Promoting green building practices, developing urban green spaces, and implementing effective waste management systems are essential for creating sustainable and resilient urban environments. Imagine the chaos portrayed in a Bollywood film where uncontrolled urban sprawl leads to resource scarcity and social unrest; that highlights the potential consequences of poor planning. A well-planned city like Chandigarh, designed by Le Corbusier, stands as a testament to the transformative power of good urban planning. Addressing challenges related to land acquisition in regions like the National Capital Region (NCR) and ensuring the effective utilization of Rs. 1000 crore allocated for urban renewal in FY 2023-24 are crucial for realizing the vision of sustainable and equitable urban development in India. Addressing issues such as unauthorized constructions in an area spanning 50 km around Bengaluru is also crucial for better Urban planning.", "normalised": "Furthermore, urban planning must also address environmental concerns.
