{"unnormalised": "In India, urban planning is a multi-layered process involving various stakeholders, from central and state governments to local municipalities and citizen groups. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) provides policy direction and funding for urban development initiatives nationwide. Key initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the Smart Cities Mission aim to improve urban infrastructure and promote sustainable urban development across 100 cities. These programs emphasize the importance of integrated planning, participatory governance, and technological innovation.", "normalised": "In India, urban planning is a multi-layered process involving various stakeholders, from central and state governments to local municipalities and citizen groups.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges persist. The legacy of outdated master plans, often based on rigid zoning regulations and inadequate data, hinders adaptive and responsive urban development. For example, the development plan for Mumbai, initially formulated decades ago, requires frequent revisions to accommodate the dynamic needs of the city. Moreover, the enforcement of building codes and regulations remains weak in many areas, leading to unplanned and haphazard development. Corruption and lack of transparency further exacerbate these problems.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.

Engaging citizens in the planning process ensures that development projects are aligned with community needs and priorities. Initiatives like ward committees in Chennai and participatory budgeting in Pune demonstrate the potential of citizen involvement in shaping urban policy.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, integrating technology and data analytics into urban planning is essential. Smart city initiatives are leveraging technology to improve urban service delivery, manage traffic congestion, and enhance public safety. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other data analytics tools can provide valuable insights for evidence-based planning and decision-making. A national conference on sustainable urban development is scheduled for 26/01/2024 at the Indian Institute of Urban Affairs (IIUA) in Delhi to discuss these issues.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, integrating technology and data analytics into urban planning is essential.
