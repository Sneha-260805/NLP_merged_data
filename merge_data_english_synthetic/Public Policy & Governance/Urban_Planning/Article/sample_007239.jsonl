{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, a crucial component of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the physical, social, and economic landscape of India's rapidly urbanizing cities. It encompasses the strategic design, development, and management of urban spaces to ensure efficient resource allocation, improved quality of life, and sustainable growth. In a nation with a burgeoning population and increasing migration from rural areas, effective urban planning is paramount to addressing challenges such as housing shortages, inadequate infrastructure, environmental degradation, and social inequity.", "normalised": "Urban planning, a crucial component of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the physical, social, and economic landscape of India's rapidly urbanizing cities.

{"unnormalised": "The National Urban Policy Framework (NUPF), a key policy document guiding urban development in India, emphasizes inclusive, equitable, and sustainable urban growth. This framework advocates for participatory planning processes, involving citizens, local communities, and other stakeholders in decision-making. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, launched in 2015, aim to transform selected Indian cities into citizen-friendly and sustainable urban centers through technology and innovative solutions. These missions often incorporate aspects of transit-oriented development (TOD), aiming to integrate land use and transport planning, reducing reliance on private vehicles.", "normalised": "The National Urban Policy Framework (N U P F), a key policy document guiding urban development in India, emphasizes inclusive, equitable, and sustainable urban growth.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has faced significant challenges. Legacy planning frameworks, often derived from colonial-era models, proved inadequate to address the complexities of modern Indian cities. Master Plans, traditionally the cornerstone of urban planning, have often been criticized for being rigid, top-down, and failing to adapt to evolving needs. The implementation of these plans has also been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, lack of inter-departmental coordination, and resource constraints. For instance, the Delhi Master Plan 2021, despite its ambitious goals, faced difficulties in addressing issues like unauthorized constructions and traffic congestion.", "normalised": "Historically, urban planning in India has faced significant challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Contemporary urban planning approaches in India are increasingly focusing on incorporating principles of sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity. Emphasis is being placed on decentralized planning, empowering local bodies to develop context-specific solutions. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other data-driven tools is also gaining traction, enabling planners to make more informed decisions based on real-time data and analytics. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, demonstrated the importance of providing financial assistance to urban local bodies for infrastructure development, though its implementation faced challenges in certain regions.", "normalised": "Contemporary urban planning approaches in India are increasingly focusing on incorporating principles of sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest heavily in building capacity in urban planning. This includes training more qualified urban planners, strengthening planning institutions, and promoting research and innovation in urban development. Effective land governance, including streamlining land acquisition processes and enforcing land use regulations, is also critical. Furthermore, financing urban infrastructure remains a significant challenge. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as land value capture and public-private partnerships, need to be explored to bridge the infrastructure gap. The upcoming review of the NUPF in 2025 provides an opportunity to incorporate lessons learned and adapt the framework to address emerging challenges. The deadline for submission of proposals for certain Smart City projects was extended until 17/08/2023, showcasing the dynamic nature of these initiatives. Moreover, the commencement of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link is tentatively scheduled for 09:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, subject to final clearances. As of 10/10/2023, the project is said to be 90% complete. Urban planning remains a critical area of public policy, requiring sustained attention and investment to ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for India's cities.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, India needs to invest heavily in building capacity in urban planning.
