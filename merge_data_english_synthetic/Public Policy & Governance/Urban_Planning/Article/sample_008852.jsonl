{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, a critical facet of public policy and governance, plays an increasingly significant role in shaping the future of India. With rapid urbanization, particularly in metropolises like Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai, the need for effective urban planning frameworks is more pressing than ever.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning transcends mere physical development; it necessitates a holistic approach that integrates economic development, social inclusion, and environmental protection. This requires careful consideration of land use regulations, transportation networks, and the provision of essential services like water, sanitation, and electricity. The recent Smart Cities Mission launched by the Government of India highlights the emphasis on technologically driven solutions for urban challenges, but its success hinges on sound foundational planning that considers local contexts and community needs.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning transcends mere physical development; it necessitates a holistic approach that integrates economic development, social inclusion, and environmental protection.

{"unnormalised": "In India, the challenges are manifold. Overcrowding, inadequate infrastructure, and informal settlements pose significant hurdles to achieving sustainable urban development. Furthermore, the legacy of colonial urban planning, which often prioritized the needs of the elite, continues to shape the urban landscape. Public policy must actively address these inequalities and promote inclusive urban environments where all residents have access to opportunities and resources.", "normalised": "In India, the challenges are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "The concept of \"sustainable development\" must be at the core of any successful urban planning strategy. This involves promoting resource efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and protecting biodiversity. Policies that encourage the use of public transportation, promote energy-efficient buildings, and preserve green spaces are essential. The vision showcased, albeit dramatically, in Bollywood films like \"Swades,\" emphasizing rural development and sustainable practices, offers a counterpoint and reminder of the need for balanced growth.", "normalised": "The concept of \"sustainable development\" must be at the core of any successful urban planning strategy.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, innovative financing mechanisms are needed to fund infrastructure projects and address the housing deficit. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can be a valuable tool, but they must be carefully structured to ensure that public interests are protected. Regulations regarding real estate development also need to be regularly reviewed and updated to prevent unchecked expansion and protect vulnerable communities.", "normalised": "Moreover, innovative financing mechanisms are needed to fund infrastructure projects and address the housing deficit.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the success of urban planning in India depends on a commitment to good governance, transparency, and accountability. Public participation in the planning process is crucial to ensure that policies reflect the needs and aspirations of all residents. As India continues its journey towards becoming a global economic power, effective urban planning will be essential to creating livable, sustainable, and equitable cities that can support economic growth and improve the quality of life for all citizens. Addressing issues like providing affordable housing in cities like Mumbai, where land is priced at exorbitant Rs. 80,000 per square foot, requires strategic planning and innovative policy interventions. The development of metro rail networks connecting areas within 50 km radius of major cities contributes to alleviating traffic congestion and promoting efficient mobility.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the success of urban planning in India depends on a commitment to good governance, transparency, and accountability.
