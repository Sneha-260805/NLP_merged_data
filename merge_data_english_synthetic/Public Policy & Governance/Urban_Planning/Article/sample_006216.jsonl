{"unnormalised": "In India, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is the nodal agency responsible for formulating policies, programs, and strategies related to urban development. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) are central to the government's urban agenda. These programs aim to modernize urban infrastructure, improve sanitation, provide affordable housing, and promote sustainable urban practices.", "normalised": "In India, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is the nodal agency responsible for formulating policies, programs, and strategies related to urban development.

Dharavi in Mumbai, for example, highlights the complexities involved in integrating marginalized communities into the formal urban fabric. Successful urban planning strategies require a participatory approach, engaging local communities in the decision-making process. This ensures that development projects are sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the residents.", "normalised": "A critical aspect of urban planning in India is addressing the issue of informal settlements or slums.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, transportation planning is integral to urban development. Congestion in cities like Delhi and Bangalore costs the economy billions of Rupees annually and contributes significantly to air pollution. Investing in public transportation systems, such as metro rail networks and bus rapid transit systems, is vital for reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality. The Delhi Metro, for instance, has significantly impacted commuting patterns in the National Capital Region.", "normalised": "Furthermore, transportation planning is integral to urban development.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning also necessitates robust regulatory frameworks. Zoning regulations, building codes, and land-use policies need to be clearly defined and effectively enforced. Corruption and bureaucratic delays often hamper the implementation of urban plans, leading to unauthorized construction and environmental degradation.
