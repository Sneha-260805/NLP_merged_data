{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges in Indian urban planning is the prevalence of informal settlements and slums. These areas often lack basic amenities and are vulnerable to environmental hazards. Policies aimed at slum redevelopment, such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), strive to provide affordable housing options and improve living conditions for the urban poor. However, implementation often faces hurdles related to land acquisition, community resistance, and bureaucratic delays.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges in Indian urban planning is the prevalence of informal settlements and slums.

The increasing vehicular traffic in cities like Bengaluru and Kolkata necessitates investment in public transportation systems, including metro rail networks and bus rapid transit systems. Integrating land use and transportation planning is essential to reduce congestion and promote sustainable mobility options. Experts often point to the success of the Delhi Metro, which has significantly improved connectivity and reduced commute times in the National Capital Region.", "normalised": "Furthermore, transportation planning remains a crucial aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning also requires robust data collection and analysis. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other technologies can assist in mapping urban areas, analyzing demographic trends, and identifying areas requiring targeted interventions. Moreover, public participation is vital to ensure that urban plans reflect the needs and aspirations of the communities they are intended to serve. Consultations with local residents, NGOs, and other stakeholders can help to build consensus and ensure the successful implementation of urban development projects. For example, consultations surrounding the development of Navi Mumbai’s infrastructure in the 1970s were critical to its success.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning also requires robust data collection and analysis.
