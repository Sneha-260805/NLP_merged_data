{"unnormalised": "India's urban landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of historical legacies, rapid growth, and socio-economic disparities. Urban planning must address these challenges through comprehensive master plans, zoning regulations, and development control rules. These frameworks, ideally revised periodically, guide land use, building construction, and the provision of essential services such as water supply, sanitation, and transportation. For instance, the Delhi Master Plan 2021 aimed to address the city's burgeoning population and infrastructural deficits, yet faced criticism regarding its implementation and effectiveness.", "normalised": "India's urban landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of historical legacies, rapid growth, and socio-economic disparities.

{"unnormalised": "Effective urban planning necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating insights from architecture, engineering, economics, sociology, and environmental science. Collaboration between various government agencies, private sector stakeholders, and community representatives is crucial for successful implementation. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, highlighted the importance of integrated urban development and participatory planning processes. However, bureaucratic hurdles and lack of coordination often hampered its progress.", "normalised": "Effective urban planning necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating insights from architecture, engineering, economics, sociology, and environmental science.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges facing urban planning in India is the lack of adequate resources and skilled manpower. Many municipal corporations struggle with limited budgets and a shortage of qualified planners. Furthermore, enforcement of planning regulations is often weak, leading to unauthorized construction and encroachment on public land. The infamous case of building collapses in Mumbai on 24/04/2013 due to illegal construction exemplifies the consequences of lax enforcement.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges facing urban planning in India is the lack of adequate resources and skilled manpower.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India must embrace innovation and technology. Smart city initiatives, incorporating technologies like GIS, IoT, and data analytics, can enhance urban management and improve service delivery. The implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) at 14:30 hrs aimed to bring transparency and accountability to the real estate sector, thereby promoting planned development. Furthermore, prioritizing sustainable transportation solutions, such as metro rail systems and bus rapid transit systems (BRTS), is crucial for reducing congestion and promoting environmental sustainability. The Kochi Metro, operational since 17/06/2017, is a commendable example of sustainable urban transport infrastructure. Ultimately, effective urban planning is essential for transforming Indian cities into vibrant, livable, and sustainable spaces, contributing significantly to national development.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, urban planning in India must embrace innovation and technology.
