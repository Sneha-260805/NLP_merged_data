{"unnormalised": "The core of urban planning involves the strategic management of land use, infrastructure development, and public services within urban areas. In the Indian context, this entails addressing unique issues such as informal settlements (slums), inadequate sanitation, overburdened transportation systems, and escalating pollution levels, particularly in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata. The legacy of unplanned urban sprawl has created a situation where basic amenities remain inaccessible to a significant portion of the urban population.", "normalised": "The core of urban planning involves the strategic management of land use, infrastructure development, and public services within urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Public policy must prioritize integrated approaches to urban planning that consider social, economic, and environmental dimensions. This includes developing comprehensive master plans that outline long-term visions for urban development, incorporating provisions for affordable housing, public transport networks (like metro rails, buses), and green spaces. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), while facing its own criticisms, attempted to address these very issues by providing funding to state governments for urban infrastructure development.", "normalised": "Public policy must prioritize integrated approaches to urban planning that consider social, economic, and environmental dimensions.

{"unnormalised": "Effective governance within urban planning requires robust institutional frameworks, skilled professionals, and active citizen participation. Local municipal corporations, in collaboration with state and central governments, must possess the capacity to enforce zoning regulations, manage land resources effectively, and ensure transparent decision-making processes. Institutions like the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) play a vital role in conducting research, providing training, and advising government agencies on best practices in urban planning.", "normalised": "Effective governance within urban planning requires robust institutional frameworks, skilled professionals, and active citizen participation.

This includes utilizing data analytics for traffic management, optimizing energy consumption, and enhancing public safety. However, it’s crucial to avoid replicating the pitfalls sometimes portrayed in Bollywood films depicting the displacement of vulnerable communities due to poorly planned development projects.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the implementation of smart city initiatives, leveraging technology to improve urban services and infrastructure, holds immense potential.

{"unnormalised": "Successful urban planning requires not just technical expertise but also a deep understanding of the social and cultural fabric of Indian cities. Inclusive planning processes that engage with local communities, understand their needs, and incorporate their perspectives are essential for creating cities that are both sustainable and livable.

{"unnormalised": "Investing in urban infrastructure requires significant financial resources. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) can play a crucial role in funding large-scale projects, such as metro rail expansions and wastewater treatment plants. However, careful regulatory oversight is necessary to ensure that PPPs serve the public interest and do not lead to exploitation or environmental degradation. The cost of living in major cities like Bengaluru or Chennai often rises disproportionately after large-scale infrastructure projects due to poorly managed land value capture mechanisms.", "normalised": "Investing in urban infrastructure requires significant financial resources.
