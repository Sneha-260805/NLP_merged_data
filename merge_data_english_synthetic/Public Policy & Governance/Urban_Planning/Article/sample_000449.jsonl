{"unnormalised": "The core of urban planning involves strategic decision-making regarding land use, infrastructure development, transportation networks, and housing provisions. These decisions, ideally guided by comprehensive master plans, aim to create functional, equitable, and environmentally sound urban environments. In India, institutions like the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) contribute significantly to shaping future urban planners and conducting research relevant to the nation's unique urban challenges.", "normalised": "The core of urban planning involves strategic decision-making regarding land use, infrastructure development, transportation networks, and housing provisions.

{"unnormalised": "One key challenge is addressing the growing informal settlements and slums prevalent in many Indian cities. Slum redevelopment schemes and affordable housing initiatives, often supported by government funding like schemes under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, are crucial but require careful planning to ensure inclusivity and avoid displacement of vulnerable populations. The principles of participatory planning, involving local communities in the decision-making process, are gaining traction to ensure that urban development projects reflect the needs and aspirations of all stakeholders.", "normalised": "One key challenge is addressing the growing informal settlements and slums prevalent in many Indian cities.

{"unnormalised": "Infrastructure development is another critical area. The expansion of metro rail networks in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru demonstrates a commitment to improving public transportation and reducing traffic congestion. However, the integration of these systems with other modes of transport, like buses and auto-rickshaws, remains a challenge. Further, the implementation of smart city initiatives, leveraging technology to improve urban services and resource management, is crucial for building resilient and sustainable cities. For instance, initiatives like integrated traffic management systems and real-time air quality monitoring contribute towards enhancing urban livability.", "normalised": "Infrastructure development is another critical area.

{"unnormalised": "Effective governance structures and regulatory frameworks are also essential. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, aimed to empower urban local bodies and devolve planning powers. However, the implementation of this act has been uneven across different states, highlighting the need for strengthening the capacity and autonomy of local governments. The role of private sector participation in urban development is also increasing, particularly in areas like infrastructure financing and real estate development. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can be effective, but require robust regulatory oversight to ensure transparency and accountability.", "normalised": "Effective governance structures and regulatory frameworks are also essential.
