{"unnormalised": "The post-independence era in India witnessed rapid urbanization, particularly after the economic liberalization policies of the 1990s. Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru experienced exponential growth, placing immense strain on existing infrastructure and leading to unplanned settlements. This necessitated a renewed focus on strategic urban planning frameworks. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), launched in 2005, marked a significant step towards promoting planned urban development through infrastructure upgrades and capacity building in urban local bodies (ULBs).", "normalised": "The post-independence era in India witnessed rapid urbanization, particularly after the economic liberalization policies of the nineteen nineties.

{"unnormalised": "Current urban planning practices in India are guided by various legislations and policies, including the Town and Country Planning Acts enacted by individual states. These acts typically outline land use zoning regulations, building codes, and development control rules. However, enforcement often remains a challenge, leading to unauthorized construction and encroachment on public spaces. The Smart Cities Mission, initiated in 2015, aims to address this by leveraging technology and innovation to improve urban governance and citizen services.", "normalised": "Current urban planning practices in India are guided by various legislations and policies, including the Town and Country Planning Acts enacted by individual states.

The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data analytics can help planners make informed decisions based on real-time data. Developing climate-resilient infrastructure is also critical, given the increasing vulnerability of Indian cities to extreme weather events. A symposium on sustainable urbanism is scheduled for 10/11/2024 at 10:00 hrs at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, showcasing advancements in the field. The draft of the National Urban Policy Framework is expected to be released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on 15/12/2024. A budget allocation of Rs. 50,000 crore has been earmarked for urban development projects in the upcoming fiscal year. Addressing the growing demand for urban amenities within a 20 km radius of major metropolitan areas by 01/01/2030 remains a significant policy goal.", "normalised": "The future of urban planning in India hinges on embracing innovation, technology, and sustainable practices.
