{"unnormalised": "The primary objective of urban planning is to improve the quality of life for all residents. This involves ensuring access to essential services like clean water, sanitation, healthcare, and education. Dr. Amartya Sen's work on capabilities and entitlements is highly relevant here, highlighting the importance of providing citizens with the necessary means to flourish within their urban context. For instance, a well-planned public transportation system, like the Delhi Metro, can significantly enhance accessibility for all, regardless of socioeconomic status.", "normalised": "The primary objective of urban planning is to improve the quality of life for all residents.

{"unnormalised": "A critical aspect of urban planning is land-use management. Zoning regulations, which delineate areas for residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational purposes, are essential to prevent conflicting land uses and ensure orderly development. Consider the Master Plan of Mumbai, which guides the city's development over a 20-year period, dictating permissible building heights, floor space index (FSI), and permissible activities within specific zones. This type of long-term planning helps to mitigate the chaotic growth often seen in Indian cities.", "normalised": "A critical aspect of urban planning is land-use management.

{"unnormalised": "Infrastructure development is another key component. This includes planning and constructing roads, bridges, water supply systems, and sewage treatment plants. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) aims to provide basic services to households, including water supply, sewerage, and urban transport, focusing on improving infrastructure in 500 cities across India. Building affordable housing is also critical. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aim to provide housing for all by 2022, addressing the acute shortage of affordable housing in urban areas. For example, a small 1BHK flat in a metro city like Bangalore might cost Rs. 30 lakhs upwards for an area of 600 sq ft.", "normalised": "Infrastructure development is another key component.
