{"unnormalised": "Urban planning, a crucial arm of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of India's rapidly urbanizing nation. It encompasses the design, development, and management of urban spaces, aiming to create livable, sustainable, and economically vibrant cities. A well-defined and implemented urban planning strategy is essential to address the challenges posed by increasing population density, inadequate infrastructure, environmental degradation, and socioeconomic disparities.", "normalised": "Urban planning, a crucial arm of public policy and governance, plays a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of India's rapidly urbanizing nation.

{"unnormalised": "India's urban planning framework draws inspiration from various sources, including the Town and Country Planning Act, enacted at different times by state governments. These acts provide the legal basis for planning authorities to regulate land use, building construction, and infrastructure development. Institutions like the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) play a vital role in research, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination related to urban planning and governance. NIUA's research informs policy decisions and provides practical solutions for urban challenges across the country.", "normalised": "India's urban planning framework draws inspiration from various sources, including the Town and Country Planning Act, enacted at different times by state governments.

{"unnormalised": "However, the effectiveness of urban planning in India is often hampered by several factors. These include a lack of coordination between different government agencies, inadequate funding for infrastructure development, and a shortage of skilled urban planners. Furthermore, land acquisition issues, often complicated by social and political factors, can delay or derail urban development projects. The success of projects like the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), often lauded as a modern marvel, demonstrates the transformative potential of well-planned infrastructure.", "normalised": "However, the effectiveness of urban planning in India is often hampered by several factors.

{"unnormalised": "The concept of \"smart cities\" has gained prominence in recent years, emphasizing the use of technology and data to improve urban services and enhance the quality of life for residents. However, it is crucial to ensure that these initiatives are inclusive and equitable, benefiting all segments of society and not just the privileged few. Urban planning must also address the needs of vulnerable populations, such as slum dwellers and migrant workers, by providing affordable housing and access to basic services.", "normalised": "The concept of \"smart cities\" has gained prominence in recent years, emphasizing the use of technology and data to improve urban services and enhance the quality of life for residents.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning, focusing on sustainable development, climate resilience, and social equity. This requires strengthening institutional capacity, promoting participatory planning processes, and investing in infrastructure that meets the needs of all citizens. The successful implementation of urban planning policies is critical to realizing India's potential as a prosperous and equitable nation. Effective enforcement of building regulations, zoning laws, and environmental safeguards is also vital. Addressing the housing deficit, especially for low-income groups, through innovative and affordable housing schemes remains a critical challenge. The next decade will be crucial in determining whether India can effectively manage its urban growth and create cities that are livable, sustainable, and inclusive for all its residents. Furthermore, transparent and accountable governance structures are necessary to ensure that urban planning decisions are made in the public interest. A budgetary allocation of Rs. 20,000 crore to urban development over 5 years will still need effective oversight to yield tangible results. The development of a 50 km stretch of a highway requires careful planning to minimize environmental impact.", "normalised": "Moving forward, India needs to adopt a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning, focusing on sustainable development, climate resilience, and social equity.
