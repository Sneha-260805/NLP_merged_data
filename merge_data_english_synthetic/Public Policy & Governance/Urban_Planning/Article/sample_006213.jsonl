{"unnormalised": "Historically, urban planning in India was often centralized and top-down, exemplified by master plans that struggled to adapt to the dynamic realities of urban life. The legacy of colonial planning, with its emphasis on segregated spaces and bureaucratic procedures, continues to influence contemporary practices. However, there's a growing recognition of the need for a more participatory and inclusive approach, involving local communities, NGOs, and private sector actors in the planning process. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) sought to empower Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and decentralize planning functions, but its implementation remains uneven across different states.", "normalised": "Historically, urban planning in India was often centralized and top-down, exemplified by master plans that struggled to adapt to the dynamic realities of urban life.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing challenges is addressing the infrastructure deficit in urban areas. From inadequate water supply and sanitation to congested transportation networks and insufficient housing, Indian cities face a multitude of infrastructural woes. Initiatives like the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the Smart Cities Mission aim to improve urban infrastructure and promote sustainable urban development. However, these initiatives require significant financial investment and effective coordination between different levels of government. Furthermore, land acquisition remains a major hurdle for infrastructure projects, often leading to delays and cost overruns.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing challenges is addressing the infrastructure deficit in urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Environmental sustainability is another crucial aspect of urban planning. Rapid urbanization contributes to air and water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Promoting green infrastructure, such as urban forests and green roofs, and adopting sustainable transportation policies are essential for mitigating environmental impacts. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) plays a significant role in enforcing environmental regulations and holding authorities accountable for environmental violations.", "normalised": "Environmental sustainability is another crucial aspect of urban planning.
