It's more than just lifting weights; it's a whole vibe, a lifestyle, especially in cities like Delhi and Bangalore. Remember that toned physique Hrithik Roshan flaunted in \"Dhoom 2\"? Well, that's the aspiration fuel.", "normalised": "The rumble of the Mumbai local might be my usual soundtrack, but lately, a different rhythm's been pulsing through my veins: the beat of urban gym culture.

We compare workout routines, exchange protein recipes (paneer tikka masala is a surprisingly good source!), and motivate each other on tough days. It’s a shared struggle, a shared victory, every rep at a time. My trainer, Ramesh, always says, \"Every day is a chance to become a better you\". He’s right. Even on days when I feel like I can barely lift 5 kg, I show up. Because that’s what urban gym culture is about: consistency, community, and a whole lot of sweat. Plus, who wouldn’t want to look a little more like Hrithik? Maybe one day I'll be able to run 10 km without feeling like dying!", "normalised": "And the community aspect is huge.
