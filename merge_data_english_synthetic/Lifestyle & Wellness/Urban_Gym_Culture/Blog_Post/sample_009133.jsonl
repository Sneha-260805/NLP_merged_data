{"unnormalised": "The sun bleeds orange over Marine Drive, another day done. But instead of heading straight for vada pav and chai, a different kind of hunger gnaws at me. It's the craving for that post-workout rush, that feeling of pushing my limits, a feeling increasingly common amongst us city dwellers. I’m talking about urban gym culture, a phenomenon that’s gripped Mumbai (and seemingly every other Indian city) like a Virat Kohli cover drive.", "normalised": "The sun bleeds orange over Marine Drive, another day done.

{"unnormalised": "My own journey started a few months ago, a resolution spurred by too much Diwali mithai. I joined \"Muscle & Hustle,\" a gym near my office in Lower Parel. Initially, I was intimidated. Towering figures like Rohan, a software engineer who benches his bodyweight, and Priya, a marketing executive who can out-squat most guys, seemed to own the space. But the instructors, trained at institutes like the National Institute of Sports, were incredibly supportive.", "normalised": "My own journey started a few months ago, a resolution spurred by too much Diwali mithai.

{"unnormalised": "Yesterday, I finally managed to run 5 km on the treadmill without stopping. A small victory, perhaps, but a significant one for me. It's these small victories, these incremental improvements, that fuel the fire. Urban gym culture isn't just about aesthetics; it’s about discipline, resilience, and a commitment to well-being in the chaos of city life. It’s about finding your own Dangal moment, one rep at a time. And honestly, after a killer leg day, even that vada pav tastes a whole lot better.", "normalised": "Yesterday, I finally managed to run five kilometer on the treadmill without stopping.
