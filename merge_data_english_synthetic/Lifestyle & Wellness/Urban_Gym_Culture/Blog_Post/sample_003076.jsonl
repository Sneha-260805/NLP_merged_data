Now, we're talking swanky studios with neon lights, pumping music, and trainers shouting encouragement. Think CrossFit boxes in Gurgaon, Yoga studios in Koregaon Park, and strength training hubs popping up near every metro station. Even my nani in Chennai knows what a protein shake is!"}

There's a real focus on functional fitness, mobility, and overall well-being. You'll find folks doing everything from powerlifting to Pilates.
