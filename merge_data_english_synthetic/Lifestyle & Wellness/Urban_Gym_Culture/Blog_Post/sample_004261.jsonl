{"unnormalised": "The rhythmic clang of iron, the whir of treadmills, and the collective grunt of exertion – that's the symphony of my local gym, \"Muscle & Masala,\" nestled right here in Bandra. It’s not just a place to lift weights; it’s a microcosm of urban India, a fascinating blend of ambition, aesthetics, and yes, even a touch of desi flavor.", "normalised": "The rhythmic clang of iron, the whir of treadmills, and the collective grunt of exertion – that's the symphony of my local gym, \"Muscle and Masala,\" nestled right here in Bandra.

It felt like stepping onto the set of a Bollywood action flick, a real-life \"Ghayal\" where everyone was training for the ultimate showdown (hopefully, with themselves).

{"unnormalised": "The influence of Bollywood is undeniable.

It's about feeling good, looking good, and connecting with a community that shares your goals. It's a space where you can push your limits, both physically and mentally, all while surrounded by the sights, sounds, and smells of urban India. Muscle & Masala, and gyms like it across the country, are more than just places to exercise; they are vibrant hubs of urban life. You might even spot someone from IIM-A there!", "normalised": "It’s a culture driven by aspiration, hard work, and a uniquely Indian approach to wellness.
