{"unnormalised": "But Powerhouse Gym shattered my preconceived notions. Mr. Sharma, the owner – a man built like a brick wall with a kind smile – took me under his wing.

Maybe I'll never have a six-pack like Hrithik Roshan, but I've gained something far more valuable: a stronger body, a clearer mind, and a newfound appreciation for the grit and determination of urban gym culture in India.
