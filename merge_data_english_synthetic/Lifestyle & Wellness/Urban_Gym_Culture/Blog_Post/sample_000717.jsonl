{"unnormalised": "Urban gym culture, as I've experienced it, is more than just lifting weights. It's a community forged in sweat and shared protein shakes. It’s seeing Rajesh from HR grunting through his squats, then exchanging knowing nods about surviving another project deadline. It's hearing Seema aunty, a regular since forever, blasting Bollywood tunes from the 90s while dominating the treadmill (she's got moves Kareena Kapoor would envy).", "normalised": "Urban gym culture, as I've experienced it, is more than just lifting weights.

I remember feeling completely intimidated by the ripped guys bench-pressing what felt like a Mahindra Thar. But then, I found my groove. The instructors, many ex-IITians surprisingly passionate about fitness, were genuinely supportive. They tailored workouts, patiently explained proper form, and even shared grandma’s secret recipe for protein laddoos (okay, maybe not the last part).", "normalised": "My transformation started slowly.

{"unnormalised": "It's the small victories that keep me going: finally nailing a pull-up, shaving a minute off my run time, feeling the satisfying ache after a tough leg day. The energy is infectious, fuelled by a collective desire to become better versions of ourselves. Forget expensive yoga retreats in Rishikesh; I find my inner peace amongst the barbells and kettlebells of Iron Temple. It's my urban oasis, a place where I can disconnect from the chaos of city life and reconnect with my own strength. And honestly, who needs a Dharma Productions film for inspiration when you have Seema aunty running faster than Rahul from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai?", "normalised": "It's the small victories that keep me going: finally nailing a pull-up, shaving a minute off my run time, feeling the satisfying ache after a tough leg day.
