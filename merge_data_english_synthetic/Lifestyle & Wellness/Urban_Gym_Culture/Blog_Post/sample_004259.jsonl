{"unnormalised": "I remember watching 'Dangal' and being so inspired by the dedication. That same fire burns in the eyes of the folks here, pushing through sets as sweat drips onto the rubber mats. There's Rohan, a software engineer at TCS, religiously hitting the treadmill after a long day of coding.
