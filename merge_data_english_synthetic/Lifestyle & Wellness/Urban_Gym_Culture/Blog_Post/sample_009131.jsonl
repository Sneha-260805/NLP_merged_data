{"unnormalised": "It's a scene repeated across every major Indian city: Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata. Urban gym culture has exploded, transforming from a niche interest to a mainstream obsession. Forget spending evenings glued to the TV watching \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" reruns (though, admit it, we all still do sometimes!). Now, you're more likely to find people pumping iron, striving for that Bollywood-worthy physique.", "normalised": "It's a scene repeated across every major Indian city: Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata.

{"unnormalised": "My own journey started hesitantly. \"Will I even fit in?\" I wondered, intimidated by the ripped guys and toned women I saw through the glass doors of Gold's Gym. But what I found inside was a surprisingly supportive community.
