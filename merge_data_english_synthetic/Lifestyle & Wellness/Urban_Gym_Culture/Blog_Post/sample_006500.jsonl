{"unnormalised": "Gone are the days when gyms were dusty, utilitarian spaces. Now, they're social hubs, fuelled by Instagram and the aspirational glow of Bollywood. Remember Hrithik Roshan’s sculpted physique in *Dhoom 2*? That fueled a whole generation's gym obsession, I swear! You see it reflected here – young professionals, college students from Jai Hind College, even aunties breaking a sweat, all chasing their fitness goals.", "normalised": "gone are the days when gyms were dusty, utilitarian spaces. now, they're social hubs, fueled by instagram and the aspirational glow of bollywood. remember hrithik roshan’s sculpted physique in dhoom two? that fueled a whole generation's gym obsession, i swear! you see it reflected here – young professionals, college students from jai hind college, even aunties breaking a sweat, all chasing their fitness goals."}

{"unnormalised": "After a grueling hour of squats and lunges, I join Priya for a post-workout samosa from the vendor outside – a little bit of guilt, a whole lot of deliciousness. Gym culture in Mumbai isn’t just about kale smoothies and perfect form. It’s about finding balance, embracing the sweat, and occasionally indulging in a little bit of desi goodness. It's a unique blend of global trends and local flavors, a testament to the dynamic spirit of this city. And tomorrow, we'll be back at 6 AM, ready to do it all again.", "normalised": "after a grueling hour of squats and lunges, i join priya for a post-workout samosa from the vendor outside – a little bit of guilt, a whole lot of deliciousness. gym culture in mumbai isn’t just about kale smoothies and perfect form. it’s about finding balance, embracing the sweat, and occasionally indulging in a little bit of desi goodness. it's a unique blend of global trends and local flavors, a testament to the dynamic spirit of this city. and tomorrow, we'll be back at six A M, ready to do it all again."}
