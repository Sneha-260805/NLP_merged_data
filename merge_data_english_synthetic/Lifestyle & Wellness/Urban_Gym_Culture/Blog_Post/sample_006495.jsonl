This is a meticulously curated space, often blasting Bollywood remixes, filled with individuals chasing not just physical strength, but also that perfect Instagram story. From the pre-workout protein shake (Rs. 250 a pop!) to the post-workout selfie (#gymlife, #fitnessjourney), it's a performance in itself.", "normalised": "This isn't your dad's old akhada in the village, churning out pehelwans.
