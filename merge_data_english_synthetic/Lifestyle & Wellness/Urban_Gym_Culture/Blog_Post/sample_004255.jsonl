{"unnormalised": "Beyond the aesthetic goals, the urban gym offers a unique social landscape. It's a space where individuals from diverse backgrounds – software engineers from Infosys, entrepreneurs from startups, students from IIT-Madras – converge with a common objective: self-improvement. Group fitness classes like Zumba and CrossFit, often starting at 06:00 hrs, foster camaraderie and a sense of community. You'll find folks cheering each other on during those last gruelling reps, a far cry from the isolation of desk jobs.", "normalised": "Beyond the aesthetic goals, the urban gym offers a unique social landscape.

{"unnormalised": "This culture goes beyond just the physical gym. It includes the conversations about optimal protein intake (often debated down to the last gram), the sharing of workout routines, and the collective pursuit of wellness. Gym buddies hold each other accountable, ensuring consistent attendance. Think of it as a modern-day \"adda,\" but instead of chai and gossip, it's resistance bands and fitness trackers. The gym also becomes a source of information, with trainers like Pooja guiding members on nutrition, injury prevention, and proper form. Many gyms offer specialized diet plans, sometimes costing upwards of Rs. 5000.", "normalised": "This culture goes beyond just the physical gym.

While premium facilities are sprouting up in affluent neighbourhoods, affordable options are less readily available for those living in other areas.
