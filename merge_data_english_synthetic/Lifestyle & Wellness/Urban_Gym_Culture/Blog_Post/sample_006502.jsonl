Perfectly sculpted bodies, branded activewear that probably cost more than my monthly rent, and the constant clang of weights that sounded like a construction site. I, in my faded college tee and worn-out sneakers, felt decidedly out of place. But then I saw Priya aunty, all of 5’2”, deadlifting like a champion. She’d started coming after her daughters insisted it would help with her knee pain. That's when I understood.", "normalised": "I remember my first time walking in. It was intimidating.
