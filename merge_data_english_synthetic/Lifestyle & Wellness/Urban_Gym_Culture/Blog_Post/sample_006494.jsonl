A cacophony of grunts, rhythmic weights clanging, and the thumping bass of a Bollywood remix fills the space. This is urban gym culture, Indian style. It's not just about building muscle; it's a social phenomenon, a lifestyle, and for many, a way to navigate the stresses of modern Indian life.", "normalised": "The humid Mumbai air hangs thick, even at six A M.

Now, you see swanky gyms popping up like mushrooms after the monsoon, each boasting state-of-the-art equipment and personal trainers. Rahul, a software engineer I often see at the gym, tells me he spends at least 5,000 Rs a month on his membership and supplements. “It’s an investment in myself,” he says, wiping sweat from his brow after a brutal set of squats. \"Keeps me sane after coding all day, ya know?
