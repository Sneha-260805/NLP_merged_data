Forget the morning chai, it's pre-workout and a gruelling HIIT session that kickstarts the day for many. From the seasoned lifters grunting through heavy squats to the college kids diligently working their way through a routine downloaded from Instagram, the gym is a microcosm of the city itself.", "normalised": "It’s six A M in Bandra, Mumbai, and the rhythmic clang of dumbbells is already echoing from every other building.
