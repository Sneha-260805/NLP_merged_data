{"unnormalised": "Gone are the days when gyms were solely the domain of bodybuilders prepping for competitions. Now, it’s a microcosm of society: college students like Priya trying to de-stress after hours spent poring over IIT entrance exams, young professionals like Rohan chasing that endorphin rush after a long day at Tata Consultancy Services, and even seasoned professionals like Mrs. Sharma, smashing stereotypes while deadlifting impressive weights.", "normalised": "Gone are the days when gyms were solely the domain of bodybuilders prepping for competitions.

{"unnormalised": "I remember watching “Dangal” and being inspired by the dedication and discipline. That same spirit is palpable here. The workout routines are a mix of global trends and local adaptations. You might see someone doing a CrossFit WOD followed by Surya Namaskar. Trainers are customizing diets, moving beyond the \"ghar ka khana\" vs. \"protein shake\" debate to focus on balanced nutrition plans that incorporate everything from dal-roti to lean chicken.", "normalised": "I remember watching “Dangal” and being inspired by the dedication and discipline.

{"unnormalised": "The social aspect is huge. Iron Temple, like many urban gyms, has become a community. Post-workout chai sessions are common, and workout buddies are forged in the crucible of shared suffering (and shared protein bars!).

The urban gym is no longer a luxury; it’s becoming an essential part of the modern Indian lifestyle. A space to strengthen not just our bodies, but our minds and spirits, all for a cost of Rs. 3000 per month for standard access. Pretty reasonable, right?", "normalised": "This isn't just about looking good; it's about feeling good. It's about mental and physical well-being in a fast-paced urban environment.

{"unnormalised": "And for many, like me, it's a place to disconnect from the digital world for an hour or two, focusing solely on the weights, the breath, and the feeling of pushing past perceived limitations. I just hit a new personal best, running 5 km in 30 minutes on the treadmill! It’s a small victory, but it feels huge. This is urban gym culture in action.", "normalised": "And for many, like me, it's a place to disconnect from the digital world for an hour or two, focusing solely on the weights, the breath, and the feeling of pushing past perceived limitations.
