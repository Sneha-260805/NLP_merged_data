{"unnormalised": "My own journey into this world started last year, spurred on by the post-Diwali guilt and the sudden realization that my wardrobe was protesting. Initially, it was daunting. The chrome and steel, the grunts and shouts, the perfectly toned instructors barking instructions – it felt like a scene straight out of 'Dostana', but instead of flirting, everyone was lifting ridiculously heavy weights.", "normalised": "My own journey into this world started last year, spurred on by the post-Diwali guilt and the sudden realization that my wardrobe was protesting.

They had a good mix of cardio machines (perfect for escaping the constant honking outside), a decent weight section, and, crucially, classes that didn't feel like a punishment. I started with Zumba (yes, me!) and slowly eased into strength training.", "normalised": "Finding the right gym is key. I bounced around a few before settling on \"Iron and Grace\" near Bandra.

{"unnormalised": "The fitness industry in India is booming. From crossfit boxes in Gurgaon to yoga studios in Pune, everyone is chasing that \"perfect\" body. But for me, the gym is about feeling stronger, both physically and mentally. It’s about that post-workout rush, that sense of accomplishment, and maybe, just maybe, fitting back into those jeans I bought last year.
