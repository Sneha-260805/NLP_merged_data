Forget leisurely chai breaks; nowadays, catching up with friends often involves a grueling spin class or a protein shake after a leg day at your local gym. This isn't your dad’s akhara anymore. We’re talking sleek equipment, pumping Bollywood remixes, and personal trainers who look like they’ve stepped straight out of a Dharma Productions film.", "normalised": "Mumbai.

{"unnormalised": "Remember when fitness was just about joining a laughter club in your colony garden? Now, it's a meticulously planned affair. We're tracking macros, obsessing over heart rate zones, and documenting our progress on Instagram with the hashtag #FitIndia. My own transformation started after watching “Dangal.” Geeta Phogat's dedication inspired me to trade my daily samosa for a 5km run.", "normalised": "Remember when fitness was just about joining a laughter club in your colony garden?

{"unnormalised": "But the urban gym culture is more than just physical transformation. It's about community. It's about the shared suffering of burpees at 6 AM. I met my best friend, Priya, at a Zumba class. We bonded over our shared inability to coordinate our left feet. Now, we spot each other at the bench press and complain about DOMS together.", "normalised": "But the urban gym culture is more than just physical transformation. It's about community.

{"unnormalised": "But at its core, the urban gym culture reflects a deeper shift. We are more aware of our health, more invested in longevity, and more willing to push our limits. Whether you're a student at IIT Madras needing to de-stress after exams or a busy executive in Gurgaon trying to squeeze in a workout between meetings, the gym has become a sanctuary. A place to sweat out the stress, build strength, and find a little bit of peace in the chaotic symphony of city life. It's a modern-day pilgrimage, a journey towards a healthier, happier, and fitter version of ourselves.", "normalised": "But at its core, the urban gym culture reflects a deeper shift.
