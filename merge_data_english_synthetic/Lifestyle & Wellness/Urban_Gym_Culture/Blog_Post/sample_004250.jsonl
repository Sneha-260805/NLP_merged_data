Don't get caught up in chasing unrealistic body ideals fuelled by social media. Focus on sustainable habits that support your overall well-being. Listen to your body, prioritize recovery, and remember that progress takes time. A marathon, not a sprint. Think of it like India's economic growth since 15/08/1947 - slow and steady wins the race. Don’t aim for 6 pack abs in a month; focus on consistent effort and a balanced diet. Seek guidance from certified trainers and nutritionists to avoid injuries and ensure a safe and effective fitness journey. Remember to hydrate sufficiently after that intense spin class at 18:00 hrs! The journey to a healthier you is personal and should be enjoyable. Run that 5 km route in your neighbourhood; it all contributes to the larger picture.", "normalised": "However, it's important to approach this culture mindfully.
