{"unnormalised": "So, I've been hitting the gym regularly in Mumbai for the past year now, and it's got me thinking – what's the deal with the whole urban gym culture scene?

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, it feels like a whole world of its own! You’ve got your die-hard lifters who practically live at the gym, the folks just trying to squeeze in a quick cardio session before heading to work, and the social butterflies who seem more interested in catching up with friends than actually lifting weights. I've seen uncles from Bandra pumping iron alongside college kids from IIT, talking about everything from stock markets to the latest Bollywood releases.", "normalised": "So, I have been hitting the gym regularly in Mumbai for the past one year now, and it has got me thinking – what is the deal with the whole urban gym culture scene?
