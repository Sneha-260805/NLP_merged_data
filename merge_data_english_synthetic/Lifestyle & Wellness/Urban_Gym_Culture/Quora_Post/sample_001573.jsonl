For starters, the accessibility has improved drastically. You have got gyms popping up on every corner, offering everything from Zumba to CrossFit to good old weightlifting. Plus, the social aspect is a big draw. I know so many people who have made new friends at their gym, bonding over shared workout struggles! Think of it as a healthy version of grabbing chai at your local tapri."}

The gyms are brightly lit, lots of mirrors, and everyone is wearing stylish activewear. It pushes you that extra mile, right?

Many gyms offer flexible timings and amenities like protein shakes and towels. For someone with a hectic schedule, the thought of having everything in one place is a huge bonus. My local gym is about two kilometer from my house, and it has got around five thousand square feet of space. It costs around rupee two thousand five hundred a month, not bad considering what is on offer."}

The pressure to \"look good\" can be intense, and some folks get caught up in fad diets and overly aggressive training regimes.
