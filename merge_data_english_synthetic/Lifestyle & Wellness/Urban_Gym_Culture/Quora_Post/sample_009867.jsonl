Maybe. But I think there is more to it than just wanting to look like Hrithik Roshan (no shade to Hrithik, of course!)."}

Those endorphins after a good workout are seriously a lifesaver. Plus, it has become a social thing, right? You meet people, build community, and share tips – kind of like hanging out at a chai tapri, but with dumbbells."}

But I think, for many, it is about feeling good, both physically and mentally. Are the subscription prices sometimes crazy (rupees ten thousand plus per month at some places!), and the pressure intense? Yes. But the benefits, from increased stamina to improved mental health, are definitely real. And that is a trend I hope sticks around longer than the latest protein shake flavor. What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments! I usually cycle ten kilometer to get to my gym."}
