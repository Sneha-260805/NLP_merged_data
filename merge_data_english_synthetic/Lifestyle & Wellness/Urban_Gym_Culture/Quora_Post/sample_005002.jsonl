{"unnormalised": "So, I've been noticing this a LOT in Bangalore lately. Everywhere you look, there's a new gym popping up – from Indiranagar to Koramangala. It’s like urban gym culture has exploded! Gone are the days of just the local akhara or a basic weightlifting space. Now it's all swanky 5000 sq ft studios with personal trainers, fancy equipment, and protein shakes that cost more than my lunch!", "normalised": "So, I have been noticing this a lot in Bengaluru lately.

Is it genuine commitment to health, or is it just the 'in' thing to do? I'm curious to know what others think. Is this a good trend, or are we getting a bit carried away? Is the pressure to look a certain way fueled by social media, or are people truly more aware of their health? And more importantly, is it sustainable?
