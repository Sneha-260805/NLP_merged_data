Thinking of trying a panchakarma treatment myself. Heard good things about the one at Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala. Anyone else tried it? Planning a trip around Diwali (20/10/2024). Maybe around 10:00 AM on 21/10/24, I will call them. Cost seems to be around Rs. 15000 per week. Let me know your experiences!
