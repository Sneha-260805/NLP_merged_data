{"unnormalised": "Hey, that's interesting! I've been curious about Ayurveda for a while. Heard good things about the treatments in Kerala. My friend Priya went to an Ayurvedic retreat near Kochi last Onam and raved about it. Apparently, it helped with her back pain. Cost her around Rs. 50,000 for 7 days. Wonder if it's legit though. Anyone tried any specific treatments or institutions like Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala? Maybe after indulging in some biryani, it's worth considering!", "normalised": "Hey, that is interesting!
