{"unnormalised": "Hey, Ayurveda treatments sound interesting! My grandmother swears by it for everything from joint pain to better sleep. She's been going to a clinic near Kochi for years. I heard they use traditional methods, like panchakarma. Maybe I'll try it myself sometime, especially after all the Onam biryani! Rs. 5000 for a consultation sounds reasonable. Do they have online booking? Let me know if anyone has experience with similar treatments near Delhi!", "normalised": "Hey, Ayurveda treatments sound interesting!
