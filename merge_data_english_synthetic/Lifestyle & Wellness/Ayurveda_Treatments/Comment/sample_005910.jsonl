{"unnormalised": "My grandmother, Amma, swore by Ayurveda! Every Onam, she'd get a rejuvenating massage at that little clinic near Kochi, about 20 km from our home. She always said it helped her manage her arthritis pain without relying on strong medicines. Remember Dr. Sharma at the Arogya Bhavan? He'd recommend specific oils based on her dosha. It was all very interesting, like a ritual! Even the smell reminded me of freshly made biryani, comforting and wholesome. She lived till 95, crediting Ayurveda for her long life!", "normalised": "My grandmother, Amma, swore by Ayurveda!
