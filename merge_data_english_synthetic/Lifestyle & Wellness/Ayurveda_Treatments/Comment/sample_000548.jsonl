{"unnormalised": "Interesting read on Ayurveda! My grandmother, Amma, swears by it. She's 80 and still makes her own herbal remedies. We're from Kerala, you know, the land of Ayurveda. During Onam, she prepares special Ayurvedic biryani - so healthy and tasty! Always reminding us about doshas and balancing Vata, Pitta, Kapha. I've heard good things about the Arya Vaidya Sala in Kottakkal. Maybe I'll try it sometime for my back pain; those Rs. 25000 treatments seem worth it. Thanks for sharing!", "normalised": "Interesting read on Ayurveda! My grandmother, Amma, swears by it. She's eighty and still makes her own herbal remedies.
