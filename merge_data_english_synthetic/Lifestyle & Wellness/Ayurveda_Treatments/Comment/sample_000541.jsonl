My cousin, Priya, went to a retreat in Kerala, near Kochi, for Panchakarma during Onam last year. Said it completely changed her life. She used to suffer from insomnia.

Any recommendations on good clinics?", "normalised": "Hey, that's interesting! I've heard Ayurveda can be really helpful, especially for stress.
