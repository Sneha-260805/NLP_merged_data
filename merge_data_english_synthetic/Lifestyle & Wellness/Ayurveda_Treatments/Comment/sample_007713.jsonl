{"unnormalised": "Ayurveda's awesome! I tried a Panchakarma retreat in Kerala last year, around 10/10/2023. It was so rejuvenating! My dosha imbalance vanished. Dr. Sharma at the Arya Vaidya Sala was excellent. I felt like a new person after the treatment which started at 07:00 hrs daily. Definitely recommend giving it a shot! Heard good things about treatments in Rishikesh too! Maybe I'll visit in August 2024.", "normalised": "Ayurveda's awesome!
