{"unnormalised": "Hey! I've heard amazing things about Ayurveda. My cousin, Priya, went to a retreat in Kerala last Onam. She said the treatments were incredible and really helped with her stress. Apparently, they use a lot of medicated oils. Is Panchakarma worth the cost, around Rs. 20,000? Planning a trip to Rishikesh next year maybe, if it's good! Any recommendations for good Ayurveda centres? I'm thinking about trying it for my back pain. I travel about 50 km daily so need it.", "normalised": "Hey! I have heard amazing things about Ayurveda.
