{"unnormalised": "My grandma, Amma, always swore by Ayurveda. She'd get her treatments from the Arya Vaidya Sala in Kottakkal. Remember her joint pain, she managed it all with those massages & Kashayams! She even prepared special Ayurvedic medicines herself during Onam. I tried some once, tasted awful but did wonders. Planning a trip to Kerala soon, maybe I'll try panchakarma this time. Heard good things. Biryani after the therapy - perfect!", "normalised": "My grandma, Amma, always swore by Ayurveda.
