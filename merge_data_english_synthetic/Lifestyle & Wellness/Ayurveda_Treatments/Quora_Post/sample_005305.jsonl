Think light, easily digestible meals during festive times like Onam, rather than heavy biryani every day! Lifestyle adjustments like yoga, meditation, and mindful breathing are also integral parts of the treatment plan. Costs can vary significantly, from a few hundred Rs. for a consultation to several thousand Rs. for a complete Panchakarma package. Remember to consult a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any treatment. They can assess your individual needs and recommend the best course of action for you. It's a long-term commitment to wellness!", "normalised": "Ayurveda also emphasizes dietary changes, often recommending specific foods based on your dosha (vata, pitta, kapha).
