It’s way more than just yoga and turmeric lattes, although I do love both!

{"unnormalised": "Think of it as a personalized wellness plan rooted in ancient Indian wisdom. My journey started with an Ayurvedic consultation at the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala. It was such a revelation! The Vaidya (doctor) spent like an hour with me, asking about everything from my sleep patterns to my digestion. Based on that, I got personalized recommendations – specific herbs, dietary changes, even the best time for me to wake up (ideally before 06:00 hrs!).", "normalised": "Think of it as a personalized wellness plan rooted in ancient Indian wisdom.

{"unnormalised": "One of the things I've been exploring is Abhyanga - a warm oil massage. Trust me, after a long week at work, this is pure bliss. I even tried a Shirodhara treatment last month, which involves warm oil being poured on your forehead. Sounds weird, feels amazing! Supposedly, it’s great for stress relief. My grandma swears by it for her arthritis too! She’s been following Ayurvedic principles since 1950.", "normalised": "One of the things I have been exploring is Abhyanga - a warm oil massage.
