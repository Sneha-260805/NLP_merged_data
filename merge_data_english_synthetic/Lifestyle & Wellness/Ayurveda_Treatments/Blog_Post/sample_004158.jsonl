Deadlines at work, the constant honking, and the relentless pressure to “hustle” left me feeling depleted and, frankly, a little lost.

Lush greenery, the scent of sandalwood, and the gentle chanting created an atmosphere of instant tranquility. My consultation with Dr. Sharma at 09:30 hrs on the first day was enlightening. He patiently explained my *dosha* – my unique mind-body constitution – and how imbalances were manifesting as stress and fatigue.", "normalised": "Kerala, the land of coconuts and backwaters, was exactly the balm my soul needed.

{"unnormalised": "The *panchakarma* treatments were intensive but profoundly restorative. Daily *abhyanga* (oil massage), *shirodhara* (oil streaming on the forehead), and herbal steam baths helped release toxins and calm my nervous system. The special Ayurvedic diet, initially bland, proved surprisingly delicious and nourishing. Evening yoga sessions overlooking the Arabian Sea at 17:00 hrs helped me reconnect with my body.", "normalised": "The *panchakarma* treatments were intensive but profoundly restorative.

{"unnormalised": "While one week isn't a cure-all, the *panchakarma* experience was transformative. I returned to Mumbai feeling lighter, more focused, and equipped with practical tools for managing stress and maintaining balance. I now incorporate Ayurvedic principles into my daily routine – from mindful eating to regular self-massage. It's a journey, not a destination, but I'm grateful for this newfound path to wellness. It cost me approximately Rs. 35,000 for the week-long treatment, but the benefits are priceless. I’m even considering a longer retreat next year, maybe for 2 weeks!", "normalised": "While one week isn't a cure-all, the *panchakarma* experience was transformative.
