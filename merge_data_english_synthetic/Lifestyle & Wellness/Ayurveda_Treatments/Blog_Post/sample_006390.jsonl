Dr. Nair, with his calm demeanor and insightful questions, spent a good hour understanding my lifestyle, diet, and medical history. He diagnosed a Vata imbalance and prescribed a personalized regimen that included Abhyanga (oil massage), Shirodhara (a steady stream of oil poured on the forehead), and a specific diet plan.", "normalised": "My journey started with a consultation at the Kerala Ayurveda Centre in Chembur.

{"unnormalised": "The Abhyanga, performed by a kind therapist named Lakshmi, was incredibly soothing. The warm sesame oil melted away the tension in my muscles, and I felt a sense of calm I hadn't experienced in years. The Shirodhara was equally transformative. Lying there with the warm oil trickling onto my forehead, I felt a deep sense of relaxation, almost meditative.", "normalised": "The Abhyanga, performed by a kind therapist named Lakshmi, was incredibly soothing.

{"unnormalised": "The dietary changes were initially challenging. Saying goodbye to my beloved spicy street food and embracing kitchari (a mung bean and rice dish) took some getting used to. But as the days turned into weeks, I noticed a significant shift. I felt more energetic, my digestion improved, and my sleep became deeper and more restful. I even managed to wake up before sunrise at 06:00 hrs a couple of times!", "normalised": "The dietary changes were initially challenging.

{"unnormalised": "It's been three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and while I still struggle to maintain perfect balance – especially during Diwali festivities on 14/11/2020 – I'm more aware of my body and its needs. I incorporate Ayurvedic principles into my daily routine, like drinking warm water with lemon in the morning and practicing mindful eating. Ayurveda isn't just a treatment; it's a lifestyle, a way of connecting with my inner self and finding harmony in the chaos of urban life. I plan to revisit Dr. Nair for a follow-up consultation on 26/01/2024. Maybe then, I'll finally master the art of balancing my doshas, just like Aaji always did.", "normalised": "It's been three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and while I still struggle to maintain perfect balance – especially during Diwali festivities on fourteenth november two thousand and twenty – I'm more aware of my body and its needs.
