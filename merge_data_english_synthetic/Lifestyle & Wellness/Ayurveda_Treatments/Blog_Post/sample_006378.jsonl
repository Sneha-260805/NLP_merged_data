{"unnormalised": "I started with a consultation at a small Ayurvedic clinic in Andheri, run by Dr. Sharma. He spent a good hour just talking to me, understanding my lifestyle, diet, and stress levels. Turns out, according to Ayurveda, I’m primarily Pitta, which explains my fiery temperament and susceptibility to heat. He recommended a Panchakarma treatment to detoxify my system and restore balance.", "normalised": "I started with a consultation at a small Ayurvedic clinic in Andheri, run by Doctor Sharma.

{"unnormalised": "Panchakarma, I learned, is no walk in the park. It's a series of therapies, from Abhyanga (oil massage) to Shirodhara (oil pouring on the forehead). My first Shirodhara session was on 10/10/2024. I was initially apprehensive about warm oil dripping onto my head for 45 minutes, but the sensation was incredibly soothing. It's difficult to describe the peace that washed over me. I practically floated out of the clinic afterwards.", "normalised": "Panchakarma, I learned, is no walk in the park.

It wasn't always easy, especially when the aroma of samosas wafted from the nearby street stall at 16:00 hrs.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the treatments, Dr. Sharma emphasized the importance of lifestyle changes: waking up early (ideally before 06:00 hrs), practicing yoga, and incorporating meditation into my daily routine. He also suggested incorporating triphala churna before bedtime. It's been about a month since I started, and I’m already feeling a significant difference. My energy levels are up, I’m sleeping better, and I'm handling stress more effectively. I even managed to squeeze in a quick getaway to Lonavala last weekend, a mini-retreat of my own! Ayurveda isn't a quick fix, but a journey towards holistic well-being. It’s about understanding your body, embracing nature's wisdom, and finding your own personal equilibrium. I'm just getting started, and I’m excited to see where this path leads.", "normalised": "Beyond the treatments, Doctor Sharma emphasized the importance of lifestyle changes: waking up early (ideally before six a m), practicing yoga, and incorporating meditation into my daily routine.
