{"unnormalised": "My first step was finding a reputable Ayurvedic practitioner. After some research, I booked a consultation at the Kerala Ayurveda Kendra in Bandra. The Vaidya, Dr. Sharma, spent nearly an hour with me, asking about my lifestyle, diet, and any health concerns. He diagnosed me with a Pitta imbalance and recommended a Panchakarma treatment, a detoxification process. The thought of a 7-day cleanse was daunting, especially with that presentation due on 20/10/2024, but I trusted his expertise.", "normalised": "My first step was finding a reputable Ayurvedic practitioner.

{"unnormalised": "The Panchakarma involved daily oil massages (Abhyanga) with specific herbal oils, steam baths (Swedana), and Nasya (nasal administration of medicated oils). The initial few days were tough.

{"unnormalised": "But slowly, things started to shift. My skin felt softer, my digestion improved, and I began to sleep more soundly. The mornings, once a struggle to drag myself out of bed, now felt refreshing.

{"unnormalised": "It's been a few weeks since my Panchakarma, and I feel like a new person. I still have my stressful days, of course. The Mumbai madness doesn't just disappear. But now, I have tools to manage it – the knowledge of my dosha, the calming effects of meditation, and the understanding that true wellness comes from within. My next goal? A trip to Kerala by 15/12/2024 for a longer, more immersive experience in the birthplace of Ayurveda. This is just the beginning of my journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.", "normalised": "It's been a few weeks since my Panchakarma, and I feel like a new person.
