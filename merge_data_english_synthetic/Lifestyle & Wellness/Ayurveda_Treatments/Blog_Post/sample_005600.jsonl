It all starts with understanding your *prakriti* (your unique constitution) through a consultation with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner.

{"unnormalised": "So, what kind of treatments are we talking about? Well, *Abhyanga* (warm oil massage) is a classic – it's deeply nourishing and helps to soothe the nervous system.

Then there’s *Shirodhara*, where warm oil is gently poured onto your forehead – bliss! It's fantastic for stress relief and improving sleep.", "normalised": "So, what kind of treatments are we talking about?

{"unnormalised": "Many Ayurvedic centers, like the one at Somatheeram Ayurveda Group in Kerala, offer Panchakarma – a detoxification process designed to cleanse the body of accumulated toxins.
