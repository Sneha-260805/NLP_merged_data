The five procedures (Pancha = five, Karma = actions) involved are Vamana (emesis), Virechana (purgation), Basti (enema), Nasya (nasal administration), and Raktamokshana (bloodletting). Don't worry, these are performed under the careful supervision of qualified Ayurvedic doctors, like those found at Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala in Kerala.", "normalised": "In the realm of Ayurvedic treatments, Panchakarma stands out.

Ayurvedic practitioners often recommend specific diets based on an individual's Dosha (body type). For example, during the festival of Onam, specific dishes are prepared that are considered to be beneficial for health according to Ayurvedic principles.
