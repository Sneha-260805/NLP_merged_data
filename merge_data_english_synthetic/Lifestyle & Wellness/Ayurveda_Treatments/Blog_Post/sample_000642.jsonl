{"unnormalised": "Working in the bustling city of Mumbai, deadlines and late nights became the norm. Stress gnawed at me, manifesting as digestive issues, constant fatigue, and a general sense of unease. My doctor recommended rest and relaxation, but that felt like a temporary band-aid. I needed something more holistic, something that addressed the root cause of my imbalances.", "normalised": "Working in the bustling city of Mumbai, deadlines and late nights became the norm.

{"unnormalised": "That's when I decided to take the plunge and explore Ayurveda. I booked a consultation at a well-regarded Ayurvedic clinic in Kerala, the birthplace of Ayurveda, a place called \"AyurSoma\" near Kovalam. The initial consultation with Dr. Lakshmi was eye-opening. She spent over an hour listening to my concerns, asking about my diet, lifestyle, and even my emotional state. It was unlike any medical experience I'd had before. She diagnosed me with a Vata imbalance and prescribed a personalized plan that included dietary changes, herbal supplements, and Abhyanga massage.", "normalised": "That's when I decided to take the plunge and explore Ayurveda.

{"unnormalised": "The Abhyanga massage, a rhythmic massage with warm herbal oils, was particularly transformative. The therapist, named Anjali, worked magic on my stressed muscles. After the first session, which took place on 26/01/2024 at 10:00 hrs, I felt lighter, calmer, and more connected to my body. The diet changes were also surprisingly manageable. Swapping processed foods for fresh, home-cooked meals, incorporating warming spices like ginger and turmeric, and sipping on herbal teas made a world of difference. I even started waking up before 06:00 hrs to practice some gentle yoga and meditation, following Dr. Lakshmi's recommendation.", "normalised": "The Abhyanga massage, a rhythmic massage with warm herbal oils, was particularly transformative.

{"unnormalised": "The entire experience felt like a journey back to myself. I’m still learning and incorporating Ayurvedic principles into my daily life, and I’m far from perfect. I still have deadlines to meet and traffic jams to navigate. But now, I have tools and a deeper understanding of my own constitution to help me stay balanced, even amidst the chaos. I haven’t felt this good since, perhaps, childhood. My next appointment is on 15/02/2024. It's definitely a lifestyle shift worth embracing.", "normalised": "The entire experience felt like a journey back to myself.
