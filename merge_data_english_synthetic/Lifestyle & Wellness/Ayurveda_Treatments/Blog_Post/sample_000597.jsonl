{"unnormalised": "The treatments were unlike anything I'd experienced. Abhyanga, the warm oil massage, was surprisingly relaxing. Shirodhara, the gentle pouring of oil on the forehead, was profoundly calming. There were herbal decoctions I had to drink – a little bitter, but supposedly detoxifying. I even underwent Panchakarma, a detoxifying therapy that involved, among other things, a mild purging process.

I still struggle sometimes, of course (hello, deadline pressures!), but I now have tools to manage the stress. I might not be able to escape the city completely, but I’ve found a way to create balance within. I still call Amma every Sunday at 09:00 hrs, and she always asks, \"Beta, how is your Vata doing?\" And for the first time in a long time, I can honestly say, \"It's getting there, Amma.
