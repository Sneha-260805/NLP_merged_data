Lately, I felt my doshas completely out of whack! I was constantly tired, prone to headaches, and my digestion was a mess. My friend, Priya, noticed and suggested I explore Ayurveda.", "normalised": "Life in bustling Mumbai can leave you feeling frayed.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, I was a bit skeptical. I’d always associated Ayurveda with old traditions and complicated remedies. But Priya, a staunch believer, swore by it. She told me about her transformative experience at the Kerala Ayurveda Ashram near Kochi, a place she visited every year around Diwali for a rejuvenating Panchakarma treatment. She booked her next appointment for 20/10/2024 and urged me to try even just a consultation.", "normalised": "Honestly, I was a bit skeptical.

{"unnormalised": "So, I decided to give it a shot. I found a local Ayurvedic doctor, Dr. Sharma, in Bandra. He spent a good 90 minutes during my initial consultation on 10/07/2024, asking about my lifestyle, diet, and medical history. He even checked my pulse, a technique I found fascinating! He diagnosed a Vata imbalance and recommended a diet plan, herbal remedies like Ashwagandha and Triphala, and a weekly Abhyanga massage. He also suggested a 7 AM yoga session.", "normalised": "So, I decided to give it a shot. I found a local Ayurvedic doctor, Doctor Sharma, in Bandra.

{"unnormalised": "The first week was tough. Cutting out my usual spicy street food (I love my pani puri!) and trying to wake up at 6 AM felt like a monumental task. But slowly, I started noticing a difference. My headaches lessened, my digestion improved, and I felt a sense of calm I hadn't experienced in ages. The Abhyanga massage with warm sesame oil was heavenly, easing the tension in my muscles.", "normalised": "The first week was tough.

{"unnormalised": "It’s been about a month since I started my Ayurvedic journey. I’m not completely cured, of course, but I feel significantly better. I still have those days when I crave that Vada Pav, but I try to balance it out with a healthy dose of kitchari and a mindful walk. I'm even considering a longer Ayurvedic retreat sometime next year. Maybe I'll join Priya in Kerala on 15/11/2025! Ayurveda is definitely a lifestyle change, a journey towards finding balance and harmony within myself.
