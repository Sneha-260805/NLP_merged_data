{"unnormalised": "Slowly but surely, I started feeling a shift. My headaches became less frequent, my energy levels improved, and I felt more grounded. It's been about 6 months since I began my Ayurvedic journey, and I can honestly say it's been transformative. It's not just about treating symptoms; it's about understanding my body’s unique constitution (Prakriti) and creating balance. I even visited a Panchakarma retreat in Kerala for 7 days last month, a truly immersive experience!", "normalised": "Slowly but surely, I started feeling a shift.
