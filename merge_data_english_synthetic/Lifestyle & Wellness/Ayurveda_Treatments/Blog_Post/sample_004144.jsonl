{"unnormalised": "Honestly, I was skeptical. But I was also desperate. So, I booked a consultation at a well-regarded Ayurvedic clinic, Arogya Bhavan, in Kerala, famous for its authentic treatments. The Vaidya (practitioner), Dr. Sharma, spent over an hour talking to me – not just about my symptoms, but about my lifestyle, my diet, my stress levels. He diagnosed me with a Pitta imbalance and prescribed a personalized plan including Abhyanga (oil massage), Shirodhara (oil dripping on the forehead), and a strict diet. My treatment started on 26/01/2023.", "normalised": "Honestly, I was skeptical. But I was also desperate.

{"unnormalised": "The first few days were tough. Giving up my usual chai and spicy snacks felt like a major sacrifice. The Abhyanga sessions, however, were heavenly. The warm, medicated oils, skillfully massaged by the therapists, seemed to melt away years of tension. The Shirodhara, done precisely at 09:00 hrs each morning, was surprisingly calming. It felt like a mental reset.", "normalised": "The first few days were tough. Giving up my usual chai and spicy snacks felt like a major sacrifice. The Abhyanga sessions, however, were heavenly.

{"unnormalised": "My 14-day Panchakarma at Arogya Bhavan concluded on 09/02/2023. It wasn't a quick fix, but a profound shift. I returned to Mumbai feeling lighter, brighter, and more balanced. It’s now 15/08/2023 and I am still following Dr. Sharma's recommendations, with adjustments of course, considering Mumbai's lifestyle is very different from the serene backwaters of Kerala! Ayurveda isn’t just a treatment; it’s a way of life. It’s about listening to your body, respecting its needs, and finding harmony within. It's a journey, and I'm glad I embarked on it.", "normalised": "My fourteen day Panchakarma at Arogya Bhavan concluded on ninth February two thousand and twenty three.
