{"unnormalised": "The consultation itself was fascinating. Dr. Sharma spent almost an hour with me, asking detailed questions about my diet, sleep patterns, and even my emotional state. He determined my dosha imbalance (I'm predominantly Pitta, apparently!) and prescribed a personalized treatment plan including Abhyanga massages, Shirodhara (oh, the blissful warmth of oil on my forehead!), and a specific diet emphasizing cooling foods.", "normalised": "The consultation itself was fascinating.

{"unnormalised": "It's been three weeks since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and I can honestly say I feel like a different person. I'm sleeping better, my energy levels are up, and I'm approaching life with a renewed sense of calm. The cost of the whole program came to around Rs. 50,000, but honestly, it's the best investment I've made in myself. Even small changes like drinking warm water with lemon at 07:30 AM every morning or walking 2 km in the evening have made a difference. Ayurveda isn't a magic bullet, but it's a powerful tool for achieving balance and well-being. I plan to continue incorporating these practices into my daily life, long after I return to the city on 15/12/2024.", "normalised": "It's been three weeks since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and I can honestly say I feel like a different person.
