{"unnormalised": "One of the core principles of Ayurveda is understanding your unique *Prakriti*, or constitution. This is determined by the balance of three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. A skilled Ayurvedic practitioner, often called a *Vaidya*, can assess your Prakriti through pulse diagnosis (Nadi Pariksha) and a detailed consultation. Knowing your dosha can guide personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations.", "normalised": "One of the core principles of Ayurveda is understanding your unique *Prakriti*, or constitution.

It involves a series of cleansing procedures like Vamana (emesis), Virechana (purgation), and Basti (enema) to eliminate accumulated toxins (Ama) from the body. These therapies are typically administered over several days or weeks under the guidance of trained therapists. Many Ayurvedic clinics in Kerala, such as the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, specialize in Panchakarma.", "normalised": "Ayurvedic treatments are diverse and tailored to the individual. *Panchakarma*, a detoxification and rejuvenation program, is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic therapy.

{"unnormalised": "Diet plays a crucial role in Ayurvedic healing. Eating according to your dosha can significantly impact your health. For example, during Onam, Keralites traditionally enjoy a Sadhya, a vegetarian feast served on a banana leaf. While delicious, a Kapha-dominant individual might need to be mindful of the heavier, sweeter elements of the Sadhya and balance it with lighter, spicier options.", "normalised": "Diet plays a crucial role in Ayurvedic healing.
