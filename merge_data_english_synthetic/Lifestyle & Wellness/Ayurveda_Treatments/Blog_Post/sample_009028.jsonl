{"unnormalised": "My Nani, bless her soul, had always sworn by Ayurvedic remedies. I remembered her making me a turmeric milk concoction whenever I felt even slightly under the weather. Maybe there was something to it. So, I booked myself a consultation at the Kerala Ayurveda Kendra in Andheri. The doctor, Vaidya Iyer, spent a good 45 minutes asking about my lifestyle, diet, and even my emotional state. It wasn’t just about treating symptoms; it was about understanding the root cause.

Honestly, after just one session on 23/07/2024, I felt more relaxed than I had in months. The herbal oils, the gentle pressure… it was pure bliss! The program also included Shirodhara, where warm oil is poured onto your forehead – I was initially skeptical, but at 09:00 hrs sharp each morning, I found myself drifting into a meditative state.", "normalised": "He prescribed a customized panchakarma detox program, starting with Abhyanga – a warm oil massage.

{"unnormalised": "The biggest challenge was adapting my diet. No more spicy vada pav for a while! Vaidya Iyer suggested a cooling diet rich in leafy greens and sweet fruits. Initially, I craved my usual masala chai, but after a week, I started to notice a difference. My digestion improved, my skin glowed, and I felt lighter, both physically and mentally. Even my sleep improved; I was finally getting a solid 7 hours, waking up refreshed at 06:00 hrs.", "normalised": "The biggest challenge was adapting my diet. No more spicy vada pav for a while!

This Diwali, on 31/10/2024, I plan to celebrate with a traditional, Ayurvedic-inspired feast! It’s not just about finding cures; it’s about creating a lifestyle that supports balance and well-being.
