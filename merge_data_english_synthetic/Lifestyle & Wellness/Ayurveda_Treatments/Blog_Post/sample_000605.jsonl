Dr. Sharma, a kindly man with twinkling eyes, spent almost an hour with me, not just asking about my symptoms, but about my lifestyle, my diet, even my childhood!

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma also stressed the importance of routine, suggesting I wake up by 06:00 hrs each day for my morning walk and yoga. It’s been a challenge, but the early morning air in Mumbai is surprisingly refreshing. I'm learning that Ayurveda isn't just about treating symptoms, it's about understanding yourself and living in harmony with nature. My journey has just begun, but I'm already feeling the benefits of this ancient wisdom. Who knows, maybe I'll even become as energetic as Nani one day!", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma also stressed the importance of routine, suggesting I wake up by zero six hundred hours each day for my morning walk and yoga.
