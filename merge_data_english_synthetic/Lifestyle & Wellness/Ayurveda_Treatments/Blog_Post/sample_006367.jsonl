Shirodhara, where warm oil is gently poured over the forehead, promotes mental clarity and reduces stress – perfect for those hectic Mumbai days! Panchakarma, a deeper detoxification process, is often recommended for chronic conditions.", "normalised": "Based on your specific needs, a treatment plan may incorporate several therapies.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond specific therapies, Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of diet. Eating seasonally and according to your dosha type is key.

Of course, that doesn't mean you can’t enjoy a plate of biryani now and then! It’s all about moderation and balance.", "normalised": "Beyond specific therapies, Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of diet. Eating seasonally and according to your dosha type is key.
