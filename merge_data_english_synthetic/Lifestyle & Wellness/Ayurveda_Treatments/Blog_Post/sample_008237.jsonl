Now, Panchakarma sounded intimidating, but apparently, it's basically a deep cleanse designed to eliminate toxins from your body.", "normalised": "Priya recommended a place called \"Kerala Ayurveda Kendra\" near Bandra.

Turns out, I’m predominantly pitta with a bit of vata – which explains my tendency to overheat easily!

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, after just three sessions, I felt a HUGE difference. My sleep improved, my skin was glowing, and I felt significantly less stressed. Dr. Sharma also prescribed some herbal remedies, like Triphala and Ashwagandha, to take daily. He even gave me some diet tips tailored to my dosha, suggesting I avoid spicy foods and eat more cooling things like cucumbers and watermelon.", "normalised": "Honestly, after just three sessions, I felt a huge difference.

{"unnormalised": "It's not a quick fix, more like a lifestyle change. I'm still learning, but so far, Ayurveda feels like a gentle, sustainable way to find balance. The cost of each session was approximately Rs. 2,500 and the Kendra itself was quite spacious, maybe around 800 sq ft. I'm definitely incorporating more Ayurvedic principles into my daily routine. Maybe next, I'll try a cooking class focusing on Ayurvedic recipes! Anyone have any recommendations for a good class in Mumbai? Let me know in the comments!", "normalised": "It is not a quick fix, more like a lifestyle change. I am still learning, but so far, Ayurveda feels like a gentle, sustainable way to find balance.
