Burning the candle at both ends, fueled by countless cups of chai and the pressure to meet deadlines. I knew something had to give. My friend, Priya, a staunch believer in holistic wellness, finally convinced me to try Ayurveda.", "normalised": "For years, I felt like I was running on empty.

{"unnormalised": "Initially, I was skeptical. I pictured complicated rituals and bland food. But Priya insisted that modern Ayurveda is about finding a balance, understanding your *dosha* (constitution), and making subtle lifestyle adjustments. So, I booked a consultation at the Kerala Ayurveda Pharmacy in Jayanagar. The Vaidya, Dr. Sharma, spent a good hour understanding my lifestyle, asking about my diet, sleep habits, and stress levels. He even took my pulse – something I found fascinating!", "normalised": "Initially, I was skeptical. I pictured complicated rituals and bland food.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma determined that my *Vata* dosha was aggravated, which explained my anxiety and restlessness. He prescribed a gentle detox, focusing on warm, grounding foods like kitchari and ghee. He also recommended *Abhyanga* (self-massage) with sesame oil, to be done every morning before my 09:00 hrs conference call. The thought of adding another thing to my morning routine felt overwhelming, but I committed to trying it.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma determined that my *Vata* dosha was aggravated, which explained my anxiety and restlessness.

{"unnormalised": "The first week was challenging. Giving up my masala chai for herbal tea was a struggle! But slowly, I started noticing a difference.

He adjusted my regimen slightly on 26/01/2023, adding a few Ayurvedic herbs to my diet. By Diwali (October 24th, 2022), I felt like a completely different person. My energy levels were up, my anxiety was significantly reduced, and I was sleeping soundly through the night.

{"unnormalised": "Ayurveda isn't a quick fix; it's a journey of self-discovery and a commitment to living in harmony with your body and mind. I'm still learning and experimenting, but I'm incredibly grateful for the positive impact it's had on my life. Maybe someday, I'll even try Panchakarma at an ashram in Rishikesh! The key takeaway for me is that listening to your body, understanding your *dosha*, and making small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements in your overall well-being.", "normalised": "Ayurveda isn't a quick fix; it's a journey of self-discovery and a commitment to living in harmony with your body and mind.
