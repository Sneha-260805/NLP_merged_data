This was followed by personalized treatments like Abhyanga (oil massage), Shirodhara (oil pouring on the forehead), and Basti (enema therapy), all tailored to my specific needs. The warm sesame oil used in the Abhyanga, infused with medicinal herbs, was incredibly soothing, melting away the tension in my muscles.", "normalised": "The next ten days were a deep dive into Ayurvedic practices.

{"unnormalised": "Leaving Kerala, I felt a profound shift. The headaches had diminished significantly, and I felt lighter, more energetic, and more connected to myself. Ayurveda is not a quick fix; it's a way of life. I'm continuing to incorporate Ayurvedic principles into my daily routine, focusing on mindful eating, stress management, and listening to my body’s needs. My visit wasn't just a vacation; it was an investment in my long-term well-being, a journey back to balance.
