Juggling deadlines at work, managing a household, and the constant cacophony – it all felt like an insurmountable wave. My energy was depleted, sleep was erratic, and a persistent anxiety gnawed at me. That’s when my wise Nani, always a fountain of traditional wisdom, suggested I explore Ayurveda.", "normalised": "The relentless pace of Mumbai life had finally caught up with me.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, I was skeptical. I’d always associated Ayurveda with old wives' tales and bitter concoctions. But desperate times called for desperate measures.

He prescribed a personalized plan including Abhyanga (oil massage), Shirodhara (oil dripping on the forehead), and specific herbal remedies.", "normalised": "My initial appointment on twenty second february two thousand and twenty three at ten o'clock hours with Doctor Sharma was eye-opening.

{"unnormalised": "The Abhyanga was truly transformative. The warm, medicated oil, massaged skillfully into my skin, eased the tension I didn’t even realize I was holding. The Shirodhara felt like a gentle reset button for my mind. It was a blissful 30 minutes that felt like an eternity away from the chaos of the city. My daily intake of Triphala at 07:00 hrs also started to make a noticeable difference in my digestion.", "normalised": "The Abhyanga was truly transformative.

{"unnormalised": "After a week of treatment, I felt like a new person. My sleep improved, my energy levels soared, and the anxiety had subsided significantly. I even started practicing Yoga Nidra at 20:00 hrs, as recommended by Dr. Sharma. It’s not a quick fix, of course. Ayurveda is a lifestyle, a conscious effort to align with nature and nurture your body and mind. It's about understanding your dosha (constitution) and making choices that support your balance. I have a long way to go, but I’m incredibly grateful for this journey back to myself. Maybe it's time for a second trip during Diwali, on 24/10/2023!", "normalised": "After a week of treatment, I felt like a new person.
