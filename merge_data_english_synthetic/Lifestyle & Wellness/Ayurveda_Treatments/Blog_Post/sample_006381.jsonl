I arrived there on the 20/10/2023, a slightly skeptical but very hopeful version of myself. The Ayurvedic doctor, Dr. Rajesh Sharma, spent a good hour understanding my *prakriti* (constitution) and *vikriti* (current imbalance). Turns out, my *Vata* dosha was completely out of whack! Blame it on the late nights working on my project and too much caffeine, I suppose.", "normalised": "My introduction to Ayurveda began with a consultation at a renowned Ayurvedic clinic in Kerala, \"AyurVeda Nilayam,\" recommended by my Auntie Meena.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma prescribed a personalized treatment plan. It included Abhyanga (oil massage) with sesame oil infused with herbs, Shirodhara (a continuous stream of oil poured on the forehead), and a specialized diet. Let me tell you, the Abhyanga was heavenly! Imagine warm, fragrant oil being massaged into your skin… pure bliss. My first Shirodhara session felt a little odd, but by the third, I was drifting off to dreamland. The diet was a challenge initially, ditching my beloved samosas for *kitchari* and lentil soup. But by week two, I actually started enjoying the wholesome, grounding flavors.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma prescribed a personalized treatment plan.

{"unnormalised": "It’s been about three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and the changes are remarkable. I'm sleeping better, feeling less anxious, and have a newfound sense of energy. While I still crave the occasional plate of golgappe, I’m making conscious choices to nourish my body and mind. Ayurveda isn't just a treatment; it’s a way of life, a path towards holistic well-being. And I'm so glad I embarked on it. Now, off to drink my herbal tea at exactly 09:00 hrs, as per my routine!", "normalised": "It’s been about three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and the changes are remarkable.
