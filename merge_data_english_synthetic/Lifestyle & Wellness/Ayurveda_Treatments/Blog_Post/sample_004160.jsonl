For months, I was dragging myself through the day, powered by endless cups of chai and sheer willpower. Then, my grandmother, Amma, suggested I explore Ayurveda. “Beta,” she said, sipping her morning ginger tea at 07:00 hrs, “Your doshas are probably imbalanced. Go see Dr. Sharma at the Arogya Kendra in Rishikesh.”", "normalised": "Ever feel like life is just off? Like you are constantly battling fatigue, stress, and that general sense of unease? I did.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, I was skeptical. But Amma is usually right. So, I booked a consultation. The Arogya Kendra was nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the air thick with the scent of pine and something vaguely medicinal. Dr. Sharma, a kind man with twinkling eyes, spent an hour asking me about everything from my digestion to my sleep patterns (or lack thereof!). He diagnosed me with a Pitta imbalance, explaining it was causing my irritability and skin issues.", "normalised": "Honestly, I was skeptical. But Amma is usually right. So, I booked a consultation.

{"unnormalised": "He prescribed a personalized plan involving dietary changes, herbal remedies, and a series of Abhyanga massages. The diet involved incorporating more cooling foods like cucumbers and coconut water, avoiding spicy dishes which are so tempting in Delhi, and drinking special herbal teas twice a day. The Abhyanga was heavenly – warm sesame oil massaged into my body by skilled therapists. It was a daily ritual, a quiet moment of self-care.", "normalised": "He prescribed a personalized plan involving dietary changes, herbal remedies, and a series of Abhyanga massages.

{"unnormalised": "It's been three months since my first consultation on 10/07/2023, and the changes are remarkable. My skin is clearer, my digestion is better, and I feel significantly calmer. I even managed to navigate the Diwali shopping rush at Lajpat Nagar market without losing my cool! It wasn’t a quick fix, but a gradual shift. Ayurveda isn’t just a treatment; it’s a lifestyle. It’s about understanding your body, listening to its needs, and finding your own personal balance. I still have a long way to go, and I will visit Dr. Sharma again sometime around 15/01/2024. But for the first time in a long time, I feel truly well.", "normalised": "It has been three months since my first consultation on tenth july two thousand and twenty three, and the changes are remarkable.
