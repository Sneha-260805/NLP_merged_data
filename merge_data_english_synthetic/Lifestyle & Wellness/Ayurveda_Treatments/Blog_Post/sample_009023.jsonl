{"unnormalised": "I've always been a bit skeptical about alternative medicine, raised in a world of quick fixes and instant results. But lately, the stress of city life in Mumbai – the constant traffic, the deadlines, the relentless pressure – had taken its toll. I felt drained, irritable, and just…off. My friend, Priya, a staunch believer in Ayurveda, suggested I explore treatments at a reputable center near Kochi, Kerala. \"Trust me, Anjali,\" she said, \"it's about finding your dosha, your natural balance.\"", "normalised": "I've always been a bit skeptical about alternative medicine, raised in a world of quick fixes and instant results.

My initial consultation with Dr. Nair, a gentle and knowledgeable practitioner, was eye-opening. He took my pulse, examined my tongue, and asked detailed questions about my lifestyle. Based on his assessment, I was primarily Pitta, with a Vata imbalance.", "normalised": "So, on tenth October two thousand and twenty four, I booked myself a seven day retreat at the \"AyurVeda Wellness Centre\" tucked away amidst lush coconut groves.

{"unnormalised": "My daily routine included Abhyanga, a synchronized oil massage by two therapists (bliss!), followed by Shirodhara, where warm oil is gently poured over the forehead for a blissful 30 minutes starting at 09:00 hrs each morning. The aroma of sandalwood and jasmine permeated the air, instantly calming my frazzled nerves. There were also personalized yoga and meditation sessions at 06:00 AM, which, surprisingly, I started to enjoy.", "normalised": "My daily routine included Abhyanga, a synchronized oil massage by two therapists (bliss!), followed by Shirodhara, where warm oil is gently poured over the forehead for a blissful thirty minutes starting at zero nine hundred hours each morning.

{"unnormalised": "The Ayurvedic diet, initially a bit bland for my spicy Mumbai palate, proved to be incredibly nourishing. Think kitchari, warm milk with turmeric, and freshly prepared vegetable curries tailored to my dosha. I also underwent a mild Panchakarma cleanse on 17/10/2024, which felt like a complete reset for my digestive system.", "normalised": "The Ayurvedic diet, initially a bit bland for my spicy Mumbai palate, proved to be incredibly nourishing.

{"unnormalised": "By the end of the week, I felt a profound shift. My sleep improved, my energy levels soared, and the constant underlying anxiety had dissipated. While I can't promise miracles, Ayurveda helped me connect with my body and mind in a way I never thought possible. Now, back in Mumbai, I try to incorporate Ayurvedic principles into my daily life – mindful eating, regular exercise, and prioritizing self-care. It’s not always easy, but even small changes can make a big difference. Perhaps, sometime next year I might revisit for a longer 14 day program. It's a journey, not a destination, and I'm excited to continue exploring the wisdom of Ayurveda.", "normalised": "By the end of the week, I felt a profound shift.
