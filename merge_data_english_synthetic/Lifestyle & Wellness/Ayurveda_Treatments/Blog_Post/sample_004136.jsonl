{"unnormalised": "One of the cornerstones of Ayurvedic treatment is **Panchakarma**, a five-fold purification therapy designed to eliminate toxins (ama) from the body. This isn't a quick fix; it’s a comprehensive process involving oil massages (Abhyanga), steam therapy (Swedana), and herbal enemas (Basti), tailored to your individual needs. Think of it as a thorough spring cleaning for your internal system. Many clinics in Kerala, like the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, are renowned for their authentic Panchakarma programs. You might spend anywhere from 7 days to 21 days undergoing this treatment, depending on your needs.", "normalised": "One of the cornerstones of Ayurvedic treatment is **Panchakarma**, a five-fold purification therapy designed to eliminate toxins (ama) from the body.

For instance, someone with a Pitta imbalance might benefit from cooling foods like coconut water and avoiding spicy dishes like biryani, especially during the hot Indian summers. A Kapha-dominant individual, on the other hand, may need to avoid heavy, oily foods and focus on lighter fare.", "normalised": "Another crucial aspect is **diet**.

Herbs like Ashwagandha, known for its adaptogenic properties, and Triphala, a gentle digestive tonic, are commonly used to support various aspects of health. Consulting an Ayurvedic practitioner is crucial to determine the right herbs and dosages for your specific condition.
