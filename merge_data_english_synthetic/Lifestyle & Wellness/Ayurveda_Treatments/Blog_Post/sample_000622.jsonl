{"unnormalised": "My research led me to Kerala, the land of Ayurveda. After hours of online browsing and phone calls (at truly ungodly hours, like 03:00 hrs IST!), I booked a two-week stay at an Ayurvedic retreat near Kovalam. The initial consultation with the Vaidya (Ayurvedic doctor) was fascinating. He took my pulse, examined my tongue, and asked me a million questions. He diagnosed a Vata imbalance and prescribed a personalized treatment plan involving abhyanga (oil massage), shirodhara (oil pouring on the forehead), and a specific diet.", "normalised": "My research led me to Kerala, the land of Ayurveda.

{"unnormalised": "The first few days were challenging. Waking up at 06:00 hrs for yoga was a shock to my system! And the diet – primarily kitchari (a mung bean and rice dish) – took some getting used to. There were no Starbucks lattes or pizzas in sight. But slowly, something shifted. The daily massages melted away the tension that had been building up for years. The shirodhara sessions were incredibly calming, and I started sleeping better than I had in months.", "normalised": "The first few days were challenging.

I learned the importance of listening to my body and making conscious choices that support my well-being. The experience wasn't just a vacation; it was a journey of self-discovery. It's been a few months since my trip, and I'm still incorporating the principles of Ayurveda into my daily life. Aaji, it turns out, was right all along!
