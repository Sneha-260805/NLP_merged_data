For those of you not familiar, Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on holistic healing, aiming to balance the body, mind, and spirit. It's more than just treating symptoms; it's about understanding the root cause of imbalances.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

You know, that typical millennial life in Mumbai, juggling work, family, and trying to squeeze in some semblance of a social life?

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma, the Ayurvedic physician, took the time to really understand my lifestyle, diet, and medical history. He identified my dosha imbalance (we’ll get into doshas another time!) and recommended a personalized treatment plan. It included things like Abhyanga (warm oil massage), Shirodhara (gentle pouring of oil on the forehead - SO relaxing!), and dietary changes tailored to my constitution. I even started incorporating more yoga and pranayama into my daily routine.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, the Ayurvedic physician, took the time to really understand my lifestyle, diet, and medical history.

{"unnormalised": "One of the things I love most about Ayurveda is that it emphasizes preventative care. It's not just about treating ailments; it's about living a life that promotes balance and harmony.
