{"unnormalised": "Honestly, some of the treatments were a little unusual at first. But gradually, I began to feel a shift. The stress that had been clinging to me like a persistent monsoon cloud started to dissipate. The food, strictly vegetarian and tailored to my dosha imbalances, was surprisingly delicious.

{"unnormalised": "By the end of the retreat, I felt rejuvenated, lighter, and more centered. I learned so much about listening to my body’s needs, eating mindfully, and incorporating simple Ayurvedic practices into my daily routine back in Mumbai. It’s not a magic bullet, but it's a powerful tool for finding balance and well-being in a world that often feels overwhelming. I even managed to convince Amma to try a proper Abhyanga, and she loved it! I'm already planning my next trip, maybe in November for the quieter season. Ayurveda, I believe, is a journey, not a destination.", "normalised": "By the end of the retreat, I felt rejuvenated, lighter, and more centered.
