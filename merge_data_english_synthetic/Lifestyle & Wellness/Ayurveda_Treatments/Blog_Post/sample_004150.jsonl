So, when the opportunity arose to spend two weeks in Kerala, \"God's Own Country,\" at an Ayurvedic retreat, I jumped at it.

{"unnormalised": "My destination was a small, family-run retreat nestled amidst the lush green hills near Munnar. The day began early, usually around 06:00 hrs, with gentle yoga and meditation overlooking the tea plantations. Then came the consultation with Dr. Priya, a warm and incredibly knowledgeable Ayurvedic practitioner. She took my pulse, asked about my lifestyle and habits, and determined my *dosha* imbalance – a Vata imbalance, apparently!", "normalised": "My destination was a small, family-run retreat nestled amidst the lush green hills near Munnar.

{"unnormalised": "The treatments were personalized based on Dr. Priya's assessment. For 9 days, I received daily *abhyanga* (oil massage), followed by *shirodhara* (warm oil poured on the forehead) which was strangely relaxing, even though the thought of oil dripping on my face initially unnerved me. I also underwent *pizhichil*, a full-body treatment with medicated oils. The aroma of the oils – sandalwood, jasmine, and something earthy I couldn't quite place – filled the air and instantly calmed my senses.", "normalised": "The treatments were personalized based on Doctor Priya's assessment.

{"unnormalised": "Initially, the strict diet – primarily vegetarian and tailored to pacify Vata – was a challenge. No spicy street food like I'm used to back in Mumbai!

{"unnormalised": "It wasn't a magic bullet, and maintaining the benefits requires conscious effort back home. But my Ayurvedic journey in Kerala has given me the tools – and the motivation – to prioritize my well-being. I plan to revisit on 15/11/2024 for another round of rejuvenation. And maybe, just maybe, learn to make perfect *masala chai* like Aunty Lakshmi.", "normalised": "It wasn't a magic bullet, and maintaining the benefits requires conscious effort back home.
