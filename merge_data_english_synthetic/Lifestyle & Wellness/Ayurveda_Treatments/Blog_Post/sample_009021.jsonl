{"unnormalised": "My introduction began with a consultation at the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, a renowned institution with a legacy stretching back to 1902. Dr. Sharma patiently listened to my concerns, assessing my doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) through pulse diagnosis and a detailed questionnaire. He determined I was primarily Pitta dominant, with a Vata imbalance, contributing to my digestive issues and anxiety.", "normalised": "My introduction began with a consultation at the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, a renowned institution with a legacy stretching back to nineteen o two.

{"unnormalised": "The daily Abhyanga at 10:00 AM was incredibly relaxing. The warm sesame oil, infused with herbs, soothed my aching muscles and calmed my racing thoughts. Shirodhara, performed twice a week, felt like a reset button for my mind.

{"unnormalised": "This journey, started on 26/01/2023, has been transformative. It's a reminder that true wellness isn't about quick fixes; it's about finding balance and nurturing our inner harmony, just like our ancestors did for centuries. The next step is to try Panchakarma therapy in Kerala during the monsoon season. I've heard incredible things! Who knows, maybe on 15/08/2024, I'll be writing about that experience too. It's definitely worth exploring the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda.", "normalised": "This journey, started on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty three, has been transformative.
