{"unnormalised": "Ayurvedic treatments are deeply personalized, taking into account your unique dosha – Vata, Pitta, or Kapha – which determines your individual constitution. A consultation with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner, often available in Kerala or at institutions like the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) in Delhi, is the first step. They'll assess your dosha through pulse diagnosis (Nadi Pariksha) and detailed questioning about your lifestyle, diet, and medical history.", "normalised": "Ayurvedic treatments are deeply personalized, taking into account your unique dosha – Vata, Pitta, or Kapha – which determines your individual constitution.

Think comforting khichdi, spiced dals, and vegetables cooked with healing spices like turmeric and ginger. Even a simple celebration like Onam can be approached with Ayurvedic principles in mind, opting for lighter, dosha-balancing variations of traditional dishes.", "normalised": "Diet also plays a crucial role.

While some treatments might involve significant costs, say Rs. 10,000 for a week-long Panchakarma program, or travel to a specific location 1000 km away, even small changes rooted in Ayurvedic principles can have a positive impact on your life. Embrace the wisdom of Ayurveda, and embark on a path to a healthier, more balanced you.", "normalised": "The beauty of Ayurveda lies in its adaptability.
