The Vaidya (Ayurvedic doctor) spent over an hour with me, asking about my lifestyle, diet, stress levels, and even my sleep patterns.

{"unnormalised": "It’s been about three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and I can honestly say it’s made a significant difference. I still have my moments of stress, but now I have the tools – thanks to Ayurveda and the wisdom passed down from generations, like my mother – to manage it better. I’m even considering enrolling in a basic Ayurveda course starting 15/08/2024, hoping to learn more about this ancient science. Perhaps next time I'll try panchakarma in Kerala, rumored to cost around Rs. 20,000 for a week. Who knows, maybe I'll even be able to run that 5 km marathon I've been putting off!", "normalised": "It’s been about three months since I started my Ayurvedic journey, and I can honestly say it’s made a significant difference.
