The first consultation with Dr. Sharma involved a detailed examination of my “doshas” – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – which, apparently, were way out of balance.

{"unnormalised": "The initial days were intense. Waking up at 06:00 hrs for yoga, followed by treatments that involved being covered in warm oil and spending time in a steam box.

Now, back in the hustle of Mumbai, I try to incorporate the principles of Ayurveda into my daily life: mindful eating, regular meditation, and listening to my body's signals. It's a continuous journey, but one that's already made a profound difference. Maybe next year, I'll aim for a 14-day retreat, starting say, around 15/03/2024!", "normalised": "Leaving Kerala on twentieth november two thousand and twenty three, I felt like a new person.
