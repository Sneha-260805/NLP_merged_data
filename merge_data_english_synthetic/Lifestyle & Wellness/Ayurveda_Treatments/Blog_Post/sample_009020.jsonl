I was perpetually stressed, sleeping poorly, and plagued by indigestion. My doctor, Dr. Sharma, suggested I look into Ayurveda. Honestly, I was skeptical. I’d always associated it with herbal remedies my grandmother in Kerala swore by. But, desperate for relief, I decided to give it a try.", "normalised": "Like many urban Indians, my life felt like a constant race against time.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a few months later, I can honestly say Ayurveda has been a game-changer. I'm still incorporating the principles into my daily routine - starting my day with warm water and lemon, practicing mindful eating, and prioritizing rest. It's not a quick fix, but a lifestyle shift. I even managed to convince my husband, Rohan, to try the *panchakarma* detox at the centre near our Gurgaon office on 26/01/2024 (Republic Day – perfect timing!). Perhaps the ancient wisdom of our Rishis truly holds the key to a balanced and healthy life. It's a journey, not a destination, and I'm enjoying every step of the way.", "normalised": "Now, a few months later, I can honestly say Ayurveda has been a game-changer.
