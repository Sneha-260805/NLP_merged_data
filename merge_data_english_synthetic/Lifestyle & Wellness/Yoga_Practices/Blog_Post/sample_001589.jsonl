{"unnormalised": "Like many others living a hectic life in Mumbai, I often felt overwhelmed. Deadlines at work, the constant traffic, and the ever-present buzz of the city left me feeling drained. My doctor, Dr. Sharma, suggested I try yoga to manage stress and improve my overall well-being. Honestly, I was skeptical. Me, contorting into pretzels? Not quite my image.", "normalised": "Like many others living a hectic life in Mumbai, I often felt overwhelmed.

{"unnormalised": "But I decided to give it a shot. I enrolled in a beginner's class at a small studio near my home in Bandra. The studio, though only about 500 sq ft, had a calming atmosphere with soft lighting and the scent of sandalwood incense. Our instructor, Priya, a gentle soul with years of experience, patiently guided us through the basic asanas.", "normalised": "But I decided to give it a shot.

{"unnormalised": "My first session was… interesting. I wobbled during Tree Pose (Vrksasana), felt my hamstrings screaming in Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana), and struggled to coordinate my breathing during Warrior Two (Virabhadrasana II).

{"unnormalised": "However, something kept me coming back. Maybe it was the feeling of stretching muscles I hadn't realized I had, or perhaps it was the quiet moments of stillness during Savasana. Slowly but surely, I started to notice a difference.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a few months into my yoga journey, I’ve incorporated different practices into my routine. Some days it's a vigorous Ashtanga session, other days it's a restorative Yin class. I even try to squeeze in a quick 15-minute Surya Namaskar routine before work, especially if I know it's going to be a challenging day.", "normalised": "Now, a few months into my yoga journey, I’ve incorporated different practices into my routine.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga isn't just about physical poses; it’s also about connecting with your breath and finding inner peace. I've learned to listen to my body, respect its limitations, and appreciate its capabilities. It's about progress, not perfection. And it's an investment in my well-being, much more valuable than the Rs. 2500 I spend on my monthly class fees. My journey towards \"Shanti\" (peace) is still ongoing, but I'm grateful for the positive changes yoga has brought into my life. Maybe someday I'll even be flexible enough to touch my toes!", "normalised": "Yoga isn't just about physical poses; it’s also about connecting with your breath and finding inner peace.
