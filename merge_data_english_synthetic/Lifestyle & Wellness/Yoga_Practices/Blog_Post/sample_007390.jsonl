{"unnormalised": "It started innocently enough. A free introductory yoga class at the local Isha Foundation center in Coimbatore. I, Meera, had always considered myself a “cardio person,” running 5 km most mornings and occasionally hitting the gym. But the constant city stress, deadlines at work (Dr. Sharma's team is relentless!), and just generally feeling “off” made me curious about yoga.", "normalised": "It started innocently enough.

My hamstrings screamed during Uttanasana, and my balance was laughable during Vrikshasana. I nearly toppled over!

{"unnormalised": "Since then, I've explored different yoga practices. I discovered Yin Yoga, which involves holding poses for longer durations, perfect for releasing tension. I also tried a vigorous Vinyasa flow class, which left me sweaty and energized. Currently, I am focusing on Hatha Yoga, learning about the alignment and control of each pose. I even managed to convince my mother, Lakshmi, to join me for a restorative yoga session! She complained about her aching knees at first, but afterwards, she admitted feeling much lighter.", "normalised": "Since then, I've explored different yoga practices.

{"unnormalised": "My tiny apartment in Mumbai, all of 300 sq ft, has now become my personal yoga shala. I light a diya, play some calming music (usually Pandit Jasraj), and roll out my mat. It’s become a ritual, a way to start my day with intention and peace. It's definitely worth the Rs. 1500 I spend monthly for the online subscription.", "normalised": "My tiny apartment in Mumbai, all of three hundred square feet, has now become my personal yoga shala.

{"unnormalised": "I'm no yoga expert, not by a long shot. I still struggle with certain poses, and sometimes, the distractions of daily life creep in. But the practice reminds me to come back to myself, to find that inner shanti amidst the chaos. And that, I believe, is a journey worth taking. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even master Shirshasana (headstand) without fear!", "normalised": "I'm no yoga expert, not by a long shot.
