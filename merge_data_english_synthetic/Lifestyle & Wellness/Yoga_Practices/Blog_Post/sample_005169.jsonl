Stress from work deadlines, the constant Nagpur heat, and the general chaos of life had me feeling perpetually on edge. A friend, Priya, suggested trying a beginner's class at the Isha Yoga Center nearby. Honestly, I was skeptical. I imagined bendy, lithe individuals contorting themselves into impossible shapes. Me, barely able to touch my toes, didn't quite fit that picture."}

Surya Namaskar felt less like a graceful flow and more like a series of awkward stumbles. But something clicked. The quiet focus, the deep breaths, the gentle stretching – it was different from anything I'd experienced before. Doctor Sharma, the instructor, emphasized listening to your body and honoring its limits. No pressure to become a yoga master overnight."}

But I’ve found a consistency I never thought possible. Some days it’s a full sixty minute session, others just a quick fifteen minute stretch before bed.

And knowing that even just five minutes of mindful breathing can make a world of difference is a pretty powerful thing. The cost, roughly rupee five hundred per class, feels well worth the investment in my well-being. My next goal? Mastering Sirsasana! Wish me luck!"}
