{"unnormalised": "Ever since Dr. Sharma recommended yoga for my stress levels, I've been diving headfirst into the world of asanas and pranayama. It started, as most things do, with a Google search and a slightly wobbly attempt at Trikonasana in my 600 sq ft apartment. My first real experience, however, was a trial class at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore. The sheer serenity of the place, the chanting…it was a world away from the chaotic streets of Mumbai.", "normalised": "Ever since Doctor Sharma recommended yoga for my stress levels, I've been diving headfirst into the world of asanas and pranayama.

Whether it’s a quick 15-minute session of gentle stretches before work or a longer, more focused practice on the weekends, it's my time to connect with my body and my breath.

{"unnormalised": "I still have a long way to go. I dream of one day effortlessly performing advanced poses like Natarajasana. But for now, I'm content with the small victories and the growing sense of peace that yoga brings to my life.
