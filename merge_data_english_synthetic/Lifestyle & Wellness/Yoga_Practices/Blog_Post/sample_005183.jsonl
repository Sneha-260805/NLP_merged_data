{"unnormalised": "For years, the cacophony of Mumbai life had me wound tighter than a spring. Deadlines, traffic jams near Juhu Beach, and the constant hum of notifications – it all added up to a stress level that would make Dr. Sharma raise an eyebrow. I knew I needed a change, something beyond just another weekend getaway to Lonavala. That's when I decided to dive into the world of yoga.", "normalised": "For years, the cacophony of Mumbai life had me wound tighter than a spring.

{"unnormalised": "My initial experience was a bit… clumsy. Picture this: me, attempting a wobbly tree pose (Vrksasana) in a class at the local studio, feeling less like a majestic banyan and more like a wilting tulsi plant. But, I persevered. I started with Hatha yoga, focusing on the foundational poses, guided by a patient instructor named Priya. She emphasized alignment and breathwork, teaching us to connect the physical postures with our inner state.", "normalised": "My initial experience was a bit… clumsy.

{"unnormalised": "I then explored Yin yoga, holding poses for longer durations to target the deeper connective tissues. It was challenging, requiring a surrender that didn't come naturally. One session, we held the Butterfly pose for what felt like an eternity. My hips screamed in protest, but Priya's gentle guidance, \"Just breathe, Radha,\" helped me stay present and work through the discomfort.", "normalised": "I then explored Yin yoga, holding poses for longer durations to target the deeper connective tissues.

{"unnormalised": "Now, my daily routine includes a 30-minute yoga practice in my small, 200 sq ft apartment. It's not about achieving perfect poses, but about carving out a space for myself, a moment of quiet contemplation amidst the chaos. It's about acknowledging the stress, and then letting it go, one breath at a time. My next goal? To attend a retreat in Rishikesh, the yoga capital of the world, and perhaps even learn Surya Namaskar under the guidance of a traditional guru. It might cost Rs. 5,000, but the investment in my well-being feels priceless. Yoga has shown me that shanti, that inner peace, is not a destination, but a journey, one pose at a time.", "normalised": "Now, my daily routine includes a thirty minute yoga practice in my small, two hundred square feet apartment.
