I felt completely out of place amidst the seasoned yogis, their limbs gracefully achieving poses I could only dream of.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I’m far from a yoga guru. I still struggle with Bakasana (crow pose), and sometimes, after a long day dealing with Rs. 1000 bills and grumpy clients, I just want to collapse on the sofa. But yoga has given me something invaluable: a sense of calm, a connection to my breath, and a reminder to be present. It’s my little piece of shanti in this wonderfully chaotic Indian life. Maybe you should give it a try too! It might just surprise you.", "normalised": "Now, I’m far from a yoga guru.
