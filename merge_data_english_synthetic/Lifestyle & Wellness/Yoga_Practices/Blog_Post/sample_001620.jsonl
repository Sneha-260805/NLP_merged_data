Deadlines at work, navigating the crowded local trains, and the constant hum of the city – it all takes a toll.

{"unnormalised": "I started noticing subtle shifts. My sleep improved. The tension in my shoulders began to dissipate.

{"unnormalised": "Now, my daily practice is a blend of Hatha and Vinyasa, tailored to my needs. Some days it’s a rigorous 60-minute session, pushing my physical limits. Other days, it’s a gentler 20-minute flow on my balcony, overlooking the bustling street below. I even managed to create a small yoga space for myself on our terrace, maybe 100 sq ft. It's my little sanctuary, a place to find my \"shanti\" amidst the chaos.", "normalised": "Now, my daily practice is a blend of Hatha and Vinyasa, tailored to my needs.
