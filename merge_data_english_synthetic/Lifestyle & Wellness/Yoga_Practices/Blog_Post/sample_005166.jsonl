{"unnormalised": "Yoga is more than just physical postures; it's a holistic practice. I've learned about the Yamas and Niyamas, ethical guidelines for living a meaningful life. I'm still a beginner, stumbling and wobbling along the way. I still occasionally crave a plate of spicy vada pav more than a green smoothie. But I'm finding my shanti, one breath and one asana at a time. It's a journey, not a destination, and I'm grateful for every step (and every downward dog!) along the path. Plus, my Rs. 1500 investment in a good yoga mat was definitely worth it!", "normalised": "Yoga is more than just physical postures; it's a holistic practice.
