The daily grind in Mumbai – the honking taxis, the deadlines at the office, even the simple act of navigating Dadar station – left me feeling perpetually frayed.

{"unnormalised": "But Priya persisted, and I'm so glad she did. The first class was humbling. I couldn't even touch my toes! But the instructor, a gentle woman named Radha, emphasized proper alignment and breathing – pranayama – over achieving perfect poses. She talked about Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and the eight limbs of yoga, a philosophy that extended far beyond the asanas.", "normalised": "But Priya persisted, and I'm so glad she did.

{"unnormalised": "Slowly, I started incorporating yoga into my daily routine. A simple 15-minute sun salutation (Surya Namaskar) in the morning before heading to work made a world of difference. I learned to appreciate the stillness, the quiet connection with my breath. The physical benefits were a pleasant surprise too. My back pain, a constant companion from sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, started to ease. I even managed to increase my apartment space perception – somehow 500 sq ft felt much bigger!", "normalised": "Slowly, I started incorporating yoga into my daily routine.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I explore different styles. Sometimes, I attend a Vinyasa flow class at a studio near my home in Bandra. Other times, I follow online videos focusing on restorative yoga. Recently, I've even considered a weekend retreat in Rishikesh, the yoga capital of the world, to deepen my practice. Dr. Sharma, my family physician, recommended it for better sleep and overall well-being.", "normalised": "Now, I explore different styles.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga isn't just about bending and stretching. It's about finding that inner shanti, that peaceful center amidst the chaos of life. It’s about connecting with your body and mind on a deeper level. And for me, it’s a journey I’m only just beginning. Even the Rs. 5000 expense for the new yoga mat felt like an investment in my health!", "normalised": "Yoga isn't just about bending and stretching.
