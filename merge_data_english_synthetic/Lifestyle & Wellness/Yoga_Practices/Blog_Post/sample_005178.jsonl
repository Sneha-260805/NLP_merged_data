{"unnormalised": "My yoga journey started a few years ago, fueled by a desire to escape the constant hustle of Mumbai life. I was stressed, perpetually tired, and my back felt like it was permanently knotted. A friend, Priya, suggested I try a Hatha Yoga class at the local Isha Foundation center. Honestly, I was skeptical. Me? Bendy like a pretzel? Impossible!", "normalised": "My yoga journey started a few years ago, fueled by a desire to escape the constant hustle of Mumbai life.

However, there was something profoundly calming about focusing on my breath and moving my body in sync with it.", "normalised": "But I went. The first class was... humbling.

{"unnormalised": "Over time, I started incorporating different practices into my routine. I discovered the energizing power of Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) in the mornings, followed by some calming Pranayama exercises like Anulom Vilom. On weekends, I sometimes join a restorative yoga session at a studio near my home in Bandra - they have a beautiful space of around 600 sq ft, perfect for unwinding.", "normalised": "Over time, I started incorporating different practices into my routine.

{"unnormalised": "I even tried a weekend yoga retreat in Rishikesh, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas. The instructors, Dr. Sharma and his team, were fantastic, guiding us through intense Asana practices and meditation sessions overlooking the Ganga. I spent Rs. 5000 (excluding travel, of course!) and it was worth every paisa.", "normalised": "I even tried a weekend yoga retreat in Rishikesh, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas.

{"unnormalised": "Now, yoga is more than just exercise for me; it's a lifestyle. It’s about finding that quiet space within, even amidst the chaos. It's about connecting with my body and mind, understanding my limitations, and pushing them gently. I still can't do a headstand (Shirshasana), but I can hold a plank for a decent amount of time now! The benefits are undeniable: improved flexibility, reduced stress, better sleep, and an overall sense of well-being. I might even consider walking the 5 km distance to work some days! It's a constant practice, a continuous journey, but I’m grateful for every step of the way. Namaste!", "normalised": "Now, yoga is more than just exercise for me; it's a lifestyle.
