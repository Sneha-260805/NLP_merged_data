My Downward-Facing Dog resembled a wilting daisy, and I nearly tripped over my own feet in Warrior II. But something shifted. The focused breathing, the quiet strength, even the shaky balance… it was grounding.", "normalised": "Then, my friend Priya dragged me to a beginner’s class at the local Iyengar Yoga Institute.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a year later, yoga is a non-negotiable part of my week. My practice isn't about achieving Instagram-worthy poses; it's about connecting with my body and mind. Some days, it's a rigorous Ashtanga flow, pushing my limits in a sun-drenched studio in Bandra. Other days, it's a gentle restorative session at home, guided by YouTube videos and the soothing sounds of Ravi Shankar.", "normalised": "Now, a year later, yoga is a non-negotiable part of my week.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga is now more than just exercise; it's a lifestyle. It's about mindful eating, conscious breathing, and cultivating a sense of inner peace. I still struggle with certain poses and my flexibility is nowhere near perfect, but the Rs. 1500 I spend monthly on classes is an investment in my well-being. And that, for me, is priceless. My next goal? To finally master Sirsasana (headstand) without toppling over! Wish me luck!", "normalised": "Yoga is now more than just exercise; it's a lifestyle.
