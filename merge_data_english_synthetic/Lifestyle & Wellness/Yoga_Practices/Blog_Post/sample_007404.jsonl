The daily grind in Mumbai, deadlines looming at the office (thanks, Mr. Sharma!), and the ever-present cacophony had left me feeling frayed. My doctor, Dr. Mehra, suggested I try yoga, mentioning its benefits for stress reduction and overall well-being. I initially scoffed. Me?

{"unnormalised": "But curiosity, and the nagging feeling that I needed a change, won out. I signed up for a beginner’s class at a studio near my home in Bandra, a cozy space of about 500 sq ft. The teacher, a gentle woman named Anjali, guided us through basic asanas like Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), and Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose). Let me tell you, those first few classes were humbling! I couldn’t touch my toes, my arms trembled during Chaturanga, and I felt utterly inflexible.", "normalised": "But curiosity, and the nagging feeling that I needed a change, won out.

{"unnormalised": "But slowly, something shifted. I began to feel a sense of calm washing over me during Savasana, that final resting pose. The practice started seeping into my daily life. I found myself taking deeper breaths during stressful situations, remembering Anjali’s instructions to focus on my breath. I even started doing a few Surya Namaskars (Sun Salutations) in the mornings before heading to work.", "normalised": "But slowly, something shifted.

{"unnormalised": "Now, several months later, I’m still a far cry from being a yoga master. My practice is inconsistent – some days I manage a full hour, other days just 15 minutes. But I've learned that it's not about achieving perfect poses, it's about the journey, the self-awareness, and the peace it brings. I’ve even started exploring pranayama techniques like Kapalabhati, which Anjali said is great for energizing the body.", "normalised": "Now, several months later, I’m still a far cry from being a yoga master.

{"unnormalised": "My yoga practice has become my sanctuary, my way of finding my shanti amidst the chaos of Mumbai life. And while I still owe Rs. 2500 for my upcoming month's classes, I know it’s an investment in my well-being that's worth every rupee. Maybe one day I’ll even attempt a headstand... but for now, I’m content with my humble Downward-Facing Dog.", "normalised": "My yoga practice has become my sanctuary, my way of finding my shanti amidst the chaos of Mumbai life.
