Priya, a certified yoga therapist from the Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute in Lonavala, emphasized the holistic nature of yoga, not just the asanas. We started with gentle stretches, focusing on breathing techniques like Pranayama. Initially, I struggled to even touch my toes during Paschimottanasana, feeling ridiculously inflexible.

I even downloaded some guided meditations narrated by Dr. Sharma, a famous Ayurvedic doctor, which help me center myself during stressful situations. It's more than just exercise; it's a practice of self-discovery, a way to connect with my inner self and find my shanti amidst the chaos of city life. I still can't do Shirshasana perfectly, but that's okay. The journey, as they say, is the destination.", "normalised": "Now, almost a year later, I'm practicing regularly.
