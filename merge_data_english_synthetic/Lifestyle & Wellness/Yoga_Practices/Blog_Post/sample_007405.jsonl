The studio was small, maybe 600 sq ft, but the atmosphere was surprisingly calming.

{"unnormalised": "I've also explored different styles. I tried a Hatha class at the Isha Yoga Center (online, sadly, not the actual center in Coimbatore!), which focused on holding postures for longer durations. It was challenging but incredibly grounding. I even attempted Bikram yoga once, in a sweltering room – never again!
