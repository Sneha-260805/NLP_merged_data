{"unnormalised": "Honestly, my first class was… interesting. I struggled with the Surya Namaskar, felt clumsy during the Vrikshasana (tree pose), and nearly fell flat on my face during a wobbly attempt at Adho Mukha Svanasana (downward-facing dog). Priya, of course, looked like a serene goddess, balancing effortlessly. She assured me it gets easier with practice.", "normalised": "Honestly, my first class was… interesting.

{"unnormalised": "Now, six months later, I practice almost daily. Some days it’s a full hour at the studio, in a spacious 800 sq ft room with sunlight streaming in. Other days, it’s just 15 minutes of gentle stretches at home, guided by a YouTube video from Dr. Sharma, a renowned yoga guru from Rishikesh. I've even started exploring different styles like Ashtanga and Yin Yoga.", "normalised": "Now, six months later, I practice almost daily.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga isn’t just about physical postures. It’s about connecting with your breath, your body, and your inner self. It’s about finding that “Shanti,” that inner peace, amidst the hustle and bustle of modern life. And while I’m still far from being as graceful as Priya (or earning her level of Rs. 500 reward at any yoga competition), I'm grateful for this journey. Next step? Maybe a yoga retreat in Kerala!", "normalised": "Yoga isn’t just about physical postures. It’s about connecting with your breath, your body, and your inner self.
