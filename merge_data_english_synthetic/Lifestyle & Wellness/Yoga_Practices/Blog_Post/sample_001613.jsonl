My Instagram feed was flooded with images of impossibly flexible individuals contorted into what looked like human pretzels. Honestly, it intimidated me. I pictured myself, clumsy and awkward, flopping around in a class full of seasoned yogis. But, after a particularly stressful quarter end at work (deadlines, spreadsheets, the whole nine yards!), I decided I needed to try *something*.", "normalised": "Like many millennials, I’d heard whispers about yoga for years.

{"unnormalised": "My friend, Priya, a total yoga devotee since her college days at IIT-Delhi, suggested I start with a beginner's class at the Isha Yoga Center near Coimbatore. She swore by their Hatha Yoga program, claiming it helped her manage everything from exam stress to navigating Mumbai traffic. I signed up, a little apprehensive, but also strangely excited.", "normalised": "My friend, Priya, a total yoga devotee since her college days at I I T-Delhi, suggested I start with a beginner's class at the Isha Yoga Center near Coimbatore.

But the instructor, a calm and patient woman named Lakshmi, kept repeating that yoga is about the journey, not the destination.

{"unnormalised": "Over the weeks, I started to notice subtle changes. My backaches, a chronic souvenir from long hours spent hunched over my laptop, lessened. I felt more grounded, less reactive to the daily chaos. Turns out, there's something truly powerful about connecting with your breath and moving your body mindfully. Now, I try to dedicate at least 30 minutes, 3 times a week, to my practice. Sometimes it's a structured session; other times it’s just a few sun salutations on my 600 sq ft balcony.", "normalised": "Over the weeks, I started to notice subtle changes.

{"unnormalised": "I’m far from being a yoga expert, and my chaturanga is still a work in progress. But I’ve discovered a practice that nourishes both my body and mind. It’s my daily dose of *shanti*, a little pocket of calm amidst the urban jungle. Dr. Sharma, my physician, even noted a marked improvement in my blood pressure readings! (A savings of approx. Rs. 500 per month on medication is just a bonus!). So, if you're feeling overwhelmed and looking for a way to de-stress, maybe give yoga a try. You might just surprise yourself.", "normalised": "I’m far from being a yoga expert, and my chaturanga is still a work in progress.
