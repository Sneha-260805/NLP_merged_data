{"unnormalised": "The meticulous precision and focus on alignment that Iyengar yoga demands initially felt a bit challenging. Dr. Patel, the instructor, was incredibly patient, guiding us through each asana with detailed instructions and adjustments.

{"unnormalised": "Now, several months in, I've incorporated various practices into my daily routine. A simple 15-minute session of Pranayama (breathing exercises) in the morning does wonders to calm my mind before the workday begins. In the evenings, I try to squeeze in a longer Hatha yoga session, focusing on holding poses for extended periods. I’ve even started exploring restorative yoga, which is a game-changer after a particularly stressful day. Imagine lying in Savasana (corpse pose), completely supported by bolsters and blankets, feeling all the tension melt away!", "normalised": "Now, several months in, I've incorporated various practices into my daily routine.

{"unnormalised": "The physical benefits are undeniable. My flexibility has improved significantly, and my back pain, a constant companion from sitting at a desk all day in our 600 sq ft apartment, has noticeably diminished. But the mental and emotional benefits are even more profound. Yoga has taught me to be more present, to listen to my body, and to cultivate a sense of inner peace. It's not a quick fix, but a continuous journey of self-discovery. From Rs. 5000 for the monthly class, it has definitely been worth it. And maybe, just maybe, one day I’ll be flexible enough to touch my toes without bending my knees! It’s a long road from CST station to reaching perfect alignment, but I’m enjoying the ride.", "normalised": "The physical benefits are undeniable.
