{"unnormalised": "My first class was at the \"Yoga Shala\" near Jayanagar. It was a small studio, maybe 600 sq ft, filled with the scent of incense and the quiet hum of chanting. I felt immediately out of place, a clumsy foreigner amidst a sea of graceful bodies. We started with Surya Namaskar, and let's just say my downward dog looked more like a confused cow.", "normalised": "My first class was at the \"Yoga Shala\" near Jayanagar.

{"unnormalised": "But I persisted. I tried different styles: Hatha yoga for its slower pace, Vinyasa for the sweat (and surprisingly, mental clarity), and even a restorative class that felt like being wrapped in a warm, comforting hug.

{"unnormalised": "Slowly, things started to shift. My back pain lessened. I could touch my toes (almost!). More importantly, I found a quiet space within myself. I started incorporating Pranayama, mindful breathing, into my daily routine, even during those stressful coding sessions.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga is more than just exercise. It’s a journey, a practice of connecting with your mind, body, and spirit. It's about finding your \"Shanti\" amidst the chaos.
