{"unnormalised": "My first class was at a small studio near my home in Bangalore called “Shanti Yoga Kendra”. It was a cozy space, maybe 600 sq ft, with natural light streaming in. I felt incredibly clumsy trying to keep up with the instructor, Priya. Trikonasana felt anything but comfortable! But there was something undeniably appealing about the focus and the conscious breathing (Pranayama) that followed each pose.", "normalised": "My first class was at a small studio near my home in Bangalore called “Shanti Yoga Kendra”.

{"unnormalised": "Over time, I explored different styles. Ashtanga felt incredibly challenging, pushing my physical limits in a way I hadn't experienced before. Hatha yoga, on the other hand, offered a gentler, more restorative practice. I even tried a weekend retreat at an Ashram in Rishikesh – early morning meditations by the Ganges, followed by hours of intense asana practice. It was transformative!", "normalised": "Over time, I explored different styles. Ashtanga felt incredibly challenging, pushing my physical limits in a way I hadn't experienced before.

{"unnormalised": "Now, my daily practice is a mix. I start with a few rounds of Surya Namaskar, then move into a series of asanas depending on how my body feels. Some days it's a vigorous Vinyasa flow, other days it's a quiet session of restorative poses. I always end with Savasana, allowing myself to fully relax and integrate the practice.", "normalised": "Now, my daily practice is a mix.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the physical benefits (less back pain, increased flexibility), yoga has brought a sense of calm and awareness into my life. I’m more mindful throughout the day, less reactive to stress, and more connected to my body.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga is not just about achieving perfect poses; it’s about the journey of self-discovery. It’s about finding your own Shanti, your own inner peace, one breath at a time.
