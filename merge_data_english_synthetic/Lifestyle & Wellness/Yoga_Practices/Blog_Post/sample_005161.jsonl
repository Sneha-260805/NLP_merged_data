{"unnormalised": "Over time, I've explored different yoga practices. I discovered I quite enjoy Vinyasa flow, the dynamic movements syncing with my breath. It’s a great way to start the day, clearing the cobwebs and energizing me for whatever Delhi throws my way. Restorative yoga, with its emphasis on supported poses and deep relaxation, has been a lifesaver for managing stress, especially during peak wedding season (it feels like everyone I know is getting married!).", "normalised": "Over time, I've explored different yoga practices.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga isn't about achieving some perfect pose or fitting into a certain mold. It's about connecting with your body, finding your breath, and cultivating a sense of inner peace. It doesn’t require a fancy studio (though a 500 sq ft room would be nice!), expensive leggings, or the ability to contort yourself into unimaginable positions. Just a willingness to try and a bit of patience. And maybe a less garish yoga mat than mine. Rs. 1000 well spent for that upgrade! I'm still learning, still exploring, and still finding my shanti, one asana at a time.", "normalised": "Yoga isn't about achieving some perfect pose or fitting into a certain mold.
