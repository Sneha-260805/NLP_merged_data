{"unnormalised": "My initial foray was into Hatha yoga at a local studio in Bandra. The instructor, a warm and experienced woman named Priya, emphasized the importance of alignment and breath. I struggled, to say the least! My hamstrings screamed during Uttanasana, and Virabhadrasana II felt more like teetering on the edge of a cliff than warrior-like. But slowly, something shifted.", "normalised": "My initial foray was into Hatha yoga at a local studio in Bandra.

{"unnormalised": "I branched out. Curious about the spiritual aspects, I tried a weekend workshop on Kundalini yoga at the Isha Foundation in Coimbatore. The intense breathing exercises and chanting were initially overwhelming, but I left feeling strangely energized and connected. Later, I discovered the gentle restorative power of Yin yoga, perfect for unwinding after long days spent hunched over a laptop.", "normalised": "I branched out.

{"unnormalised": "Now, my daily practice is a mix. I start with a few rounds of Surya Namaskar to awaken the body, followed by asanas tailored to how I'm feeling that day. Some days it's a rigorous Vinyasa flow; other days, it's simply holding Supta Baddha Konasana for 10 minutes with a bolster under my knees.", "normalised": "Now, my daily practice is a mix.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits have been immense. My posture has improved (no more nagging back pain!), I sleep better, and I’m far more equipped to handle stressful situations at work. Dr. Sharma, my family physician, even commented on my improved blood pressure at my last check-up. It’s not just about physical fitness; it’s about finding that inner \"Shanti,\" that sense of peace and equilibrium amidst the whirlwind of daily life. I've even converted a small 100 sq ft corner of my apartment into a dedicated yoga space! The initial investment in a good quality yoga mat (Rs. 2500) and some blocks was well worth it. The journey is ongoing, a continuous exploration of self and connection to something larger than myself. Maybe one day I’ll even attempt a headstand without fearing for my life!", "normalised": "The benefits have been immense.
