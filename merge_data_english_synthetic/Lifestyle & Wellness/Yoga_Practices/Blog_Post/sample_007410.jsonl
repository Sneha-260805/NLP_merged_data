{"unnormalised": "I started going regularly, 3 times a week. I explored different styles – Hatha, Vinyasa, and even a restorative session. My favourite is definitely Vinyasa; the flow is so dynamic, and I feel amazing afterwards. I also tried a weekend retreat at an ashram near Rishikesh. Waking up before dawn for pranayama and meditation overlooking the Ganges was a truly spiritual experience. We practiced yoga for hours each day in a hall that must have been 2000 sq ft!", "normalised": "I started going regularly, three times a week.

{"unnormalised": "It hasn't been a miracle cure, of course. Some days, my mind still races. But I've learned to use the breathing techniques Priya taught us, especially Kapalabhati, to calm my nerves. I also follow Dr. Sharma's advice on mindful eating, which complements my yoga practice perfectly. Now, even on stressful days dealing with clients and deadlines (Rs. 50,000 invoices piling up!), I find myself taking a few deep breaths and remembering the stillness I found in that little studio.", "normalised": "It hasn't been a miracle cure, of course.

{"unnormalised": "Yoga is more than just exercise; it's a way of life. It's about connecting with your inner self, finding balance, and appreciating the present moment. And for me, that's been invaluable. Amma was right all along. My next goal is to finally master the Sirsasana (headstand)! Maybe I'll even be able to run a marathon like my friend Rohan who runs 5 km daily. Wish me luck!", "normalised": "Yoga is more than just exercise; it's a way of life.
