{"unnormalised": "Honestly, my first few sessions were a disaster. I couldn't hold a downward dog for more than 10 seconds without wobbling. But the instructor at the local studio near Connaught Place, a calm and patient woman named Anita ji, encouraged me to listen to my body and find what felt right.

Pranayama techniques like Kapalabhati have become my go-to for clearing my head before important meetings.
