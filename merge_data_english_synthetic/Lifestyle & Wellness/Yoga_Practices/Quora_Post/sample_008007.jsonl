{"unnormalised": "I swear, ever since I started incorporating even a short yoga practice into my routine, things have become noticeably more manageable. Nothing too strenuous, mind you. It usually starts with a few rounds of Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) – just feels right, doesn't it?

{"unnormalised": "The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram's online classes were a total game changer during the lockdown. They offer different levels, so you can find something that suits your fitness level. I especially enjoy their focus on breathing techniques (pranayama). A few minutes of Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing) and I feel like I can conquer anything – even my mother's constant questions about when I'm getting married! Seriously though, even 15-20 minutes of yoga makes a world of difference. What are your favorite practices for de-stressing? Would love to hear your tips!", "normalised": "The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram's online classes were a total game changer during the lockdown.
