{"unnormalised": "**Question: What are your favorite yoga practices for overall well-being?**", "normalised": "As someone who has been practicing yoga on and off since my college days at Hindu College, Delhi, I can tell you it has been a game changer for both my physical and mental health. It is more than just touching your toes – it is about connecting with yourself. My go to practice is definitely Surya Namaskar. It is a fantastic way to start the day, even if I only manage five rounds. It gets the blood flowing and wakes me up better than any chai. Then, I like to hold the Virabhadrasana two (Warrior two) for a few breaths – it makes me feel strong and grounded, like Deepika Padukone in 'Bajirao Mastani'! For stress relief, nothing beats a good dose of Pranayama. Anulom Vilom is my personal favourite, calming my mind after a hectic day at work. I also try to incorporate a few inversions like Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog) because they are said to be great for circulation. Lately, I have been exploring restorative yoga too. Holding Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclining Butterfly Pose) with a bolster feels incredibly relaxing. I feel like I have recharged for days! While I am no expert, and I have not attended any fancy Isha Foundation retreats, even fifteen to twenty minutes of yoga a day makes a noticeable difference. It has improved my flexibility, reduced my back pain, and given me a much needed sense of peace amidst the daily chaos of Mumbai life. I even managed to walk five kilometer the other day without knee pain! Totally worth it."}
