{"unnormalised": "Now, a typical morning for me starts with 15 minutes of simple breathing exercises (pranayama) – Anulom Vilom is my go-to. Then, I move into some basic asanas like Trikonasana and Bhujangasana. Honestly, even just these few postures make a massive difference in how I feel throughout the day. I used to have terrible back pain from sitting at my desk job, but since starting yoga, it's lessened significantly.", "normalised": "Now, a typical morning for me starts with fifteen minutes of simple breathing exercises (pranayama) – Anulom Vilom is my go-to.

{"unnormalised": "For a deeper practice, especially on weekends, I try to incorporate some restorative poses like Supta Baddha Konasana. My aim is a consistent 30 mins, but some days it's a quick 10 minutes stretch. Small steps, right? Even my dadi, who used to scoff at the idea of \"bending like a pretzel,\" now does a modified version of Tadasana! Remember consistency is key, even a 10-minute session is better than nothing. Good luck finding your yoga groove!", "normalised": "For a deeper practice, especially on weekends, I try to incorporate some restorative poses like Supta Baddha Konasana.
