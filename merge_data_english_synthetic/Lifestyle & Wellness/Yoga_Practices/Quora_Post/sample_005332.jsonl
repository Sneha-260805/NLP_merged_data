{"unnormalised": "I initially signed up for a 07:00 hrs morning class at a local studio near my house in Bangalore. Let's just say, the initial days were brutal. I could barely touch my toes, let alone attempt a decent Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog). The instructor, a very patient woman named Priya, would gently guide me, reminding me that it’s about progress, not perfection. She emphasized the importance of proper breathing – something I often forgot while desperately trying not to fall flat on my face.", "normalised": "I initially signed up for a seven o'clock hours morning class at a local studio near my house in Bangalore.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I try to practice at least 3 times a week. Some days it's a proper class, other days it's just 15 minutes of Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) before 09:00 hrs. I even downloaded an app with guided meditations. I’m still a long way from mastering Shirshasana (Headstand), but I’m enjoying the journey. Maybe by Diwali 2024, I’ll actually be able to do it! Anyone else have a similar experience? Any tips for a struggling yogi?", "normalised": "Now, I try to practice at least three times a week.
