{"unnormalised": "## Yoga Practices: My Journey from Chai to Chakras", "normalised": "Alright, so I used to be the queen of chai and samosas, completely averse to anything that involved bending my body in unnatural ways. My idea of exercise was walking from my couch to the fridge. Then, on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty three, my doctor, Doctor Sharma, gently suggested I might benefit from a little \"lifestyle change,\" highlighting my slightly elevated blood pressure during my annual check-up. My initial reaction was, of course, \"No way!\" Yoga looked impossibly intimidating, filled with postures I couldn't even pronounce, let alone attempt. But my friend, Priya, a certified yoga instructor from the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram in Chennai, convinced me to try a beginner's class. The first session at seven o’clock hours was a disaster! I wobbled, I sweated, and I almost face-planted during Trikonasana. But Priya was incredibly patient. She emphasized that yoga wasn't about achieving perfect poses, but about connecting with my breath and body. Gradually, things started to shift. The back pain I’d been experiencing for years began to subside. I even managed to touch my toes (almost!) during Paschimottanasana. More importantly, I noticed a calmness I hadn't felt before. Now, I try to dedicate at least thirty minutes every morning to a basic routine, starting with Surya Namaskar. It's not always easy, especially around Diwali, when mithai temptations are everywhere! But even on those days, a few simple stretches at five o’clock hours help me recenter. It's been a year since that first class, and I can honestly say yoga has transformed my life. It's less about achieving some unattainable physical ideal and more about finding peace and strength within myself."}
