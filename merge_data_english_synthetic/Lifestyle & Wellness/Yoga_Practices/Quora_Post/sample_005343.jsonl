My physiotherapist, Dr. Sharma, at Apollo recommended yoga as more than just stretching – a holistic approach.", "normalised": "Okay, so I'm no Patanjali, but I wanted to share my experience with yoga.

{"unnormalised": "I started with a beginner's class at the Isha Yoga Centre on MG Road. Honestly, I was intimidated! Everyone seemed so flexible. I could barely touch my toes during Uttanasana. The instructor, Priya, was incredibly patient, reminding us to focus on the breath and not compare ourselves to others. It wasn’t about achieving perfect posture on day 1 (especially not after years of sitting at a desk since 2010!).", "normalised": "I started with a beginner's class at the Isha Yoga Centre on M G Road.

{"unnormalised": "Slowly, I started noticing changes. My back pain lessened. I felt calmer, less stressed about deadlines at work. I even started waking up earlier, around 06:00 hrs, to fit in a quick Surya Namaskar before the chaos of the day began. Now, I practice almost daily, even if it’s just 15 minutes of mindful breathing and a few asanas.", "normalised": "Slowly, I started noticing changes. My back pain lessened.

{"unnormalised": "My goal isn't some crazy acrobatic pose, it's simply feeling better, both physically and mentally. I aim to attend the Shivaratri celebrations at Isha on 08/03/2024 – something I never would have considered before yoga. It's truly been a transformative experience, and I encourage anyone feeling stressed or stiff to give it a try. You might be surprised at what you discover! It's far more powerful than just touching your toes! And it's not just for the ashrams, it's for us regular folks dealing with modern life in India too.", "normalised": "My goal isn't some crazy acrobatic pose, it's simply feeling better, both physically and mentally.
