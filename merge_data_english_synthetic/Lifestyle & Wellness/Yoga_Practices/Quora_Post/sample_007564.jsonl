{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I'll admit it, I used to be *that* person who scoffed at yoga. I was all about lifting heavy weights at the gym, thinking it was the only way to get fit. I was hitting the gym 6 days a week, religiously, since 2018. Then, one day my doctor, Dr. Sharma in Lucknow, suggested I try yoga to help with my chronic back pain. He recommended a local yoga center near my house.", "normalised": "Okay, so I will admit it, I used to be *that* person who scoffed at yoga.

The instructor, a gentle lady named Priya, was incredibly patient. She guided us through basic asanas like Tadasana, Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), and Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose).", "normalised": "My first class at the \"Shanti Yoga Ashram\" was on tenth october two thousand and twenty three at seven o'clock.

{"unnormalised": "Slowly, over weeks, I started to feel a difference. My back pain lessened, I was sleeping better, and I felt calmer. I started practicing at home too, even just for 15 minutes before work. Now, I incorporate yoga into my routine 3 times a week. I still lift weights, but yoga has become my sanctuary, my time to connect with myself and find peace amidst the chaos of life. I'm even considering enrolling in a teacher training course sometime in 2024! It's amazing how something I initially dismissed has become such an integral part of my life. It's proof that sometimes, the things we need most are the things we least expect.", "normalised": "Slowly, over weeks, I started to feel a difference.
