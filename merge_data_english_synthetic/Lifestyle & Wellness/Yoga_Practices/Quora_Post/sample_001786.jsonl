{"unnormalised": "Now, I practice regularly. I find time for a quick Surya Namaskar before work, even if it’s just for 15 minutes. And on weekends, I attend a longer session at a local ashram. It's not about achieving perfect poses; it's about connecting with my breath and finding a sense of peace within myself. I now wake up at 05:30 AM on Sundays just to practice. It reminds me of my trip to Rishikesh on 12/12/2023, the birthplace of Yoga, which further solidified my belief in its power. Trust me, give it a try. You might be surprised at what you discover.", "normalised": "Now, I practice regularly. I find time for a quick Surya Namaskar before work, even if it’s just for fifteen minutes.
