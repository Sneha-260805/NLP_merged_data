Headaches were a daily occurrence, and my sleep was… well, non-existent most nights. A friend, Priya, suggested I try yoga. Honestly, I was skeptical. Me, doing a headstand? Seemed unlikely.", "normalised": "So, I have always been someone who struggled with stress. Working a demanding job in Lucknow, I felt constantly on edge.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a year later (almost!), on 15/08/2024 (Independence Day, no less!), I can say yoga has become an integral part of my life. I still have challenging days, but I now have tools to manage the stress. I'm even attempting Sirsasana (headstand) near a wall, a few times a week. It’s not about achieving perfect poses; it's about finding peace within the chaos. If a stressed-out Lucknowite like me can do it, anyone can! Finding a good guru or studio, like the one I found, is really key! Now my yoga class is at 7:00 a.m., a change that’s helped me a lot!", "normalised": "Now, a year later (almost!), on fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four (Independence Day, no less!), I can say yoga has become an integral part of my life.
