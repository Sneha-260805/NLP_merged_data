He emphasizes proper alignment and breathing techniques, which makes a huge difference. Now, I try to incorporate some form of yoga practice into my routine almost every day. Some days it's a full hour session, other days just 15 minutes of mindful stretching.", "normalised": "I started with Hatha yoga classes at a studio near my house, a cozy little place about five hundred square feet.

Any recommendations for a good Ashtanga studio in Bangalore? (Planning a trip soon!). Also, what's a reasonable monthly fee for yoga classes these days? I’m currently paying Rs. 2500, is that the norm? Share your thoughts and experiences! It’s amazing how ancient Indian practices are still so relevant and beneficial today.", "normalised": "Has anyone else experienced similar benefits from yoga? I'm also curious about different styles.
