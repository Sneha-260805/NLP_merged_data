I used to be perpetually stressed, juggling work deadlines, family responsibilities (you know, the usual Delhi chaos!). Sleepless nights became the norm, and I felt constantly on edge.

{"unnormalised": "The first class at 06:30 hrs was a revelation. Simple breathing exercises like Pranayama felt incredibly calming. Slowly, I progressed from basic Asanas to more challenging ones. My instructor, Guru Sharmaji, emphasized mindful movement and listening to my body. There were days, especially after a late night trying to meet deadlines for my office in Gurgaon, when all I could manage was a few minutes of Shavasana (corpse pose), but even that made a difference.", "normalised": "The first class at six thirty hours was a revelation.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a year later (as of 01/01/2024), yoga is an integral part of my routine. I feel more centered, focused, and much less reactive to stress. It has also significantly improved my sleep quality. My back pain, aggravated by long hours at the computer, has also reduced considerably. I still struggle with certain poses, but the journey itself has been incredibly rewarding. If you're considering incorporating yoga into your lifestyle, I highly recommend giving it a try.
