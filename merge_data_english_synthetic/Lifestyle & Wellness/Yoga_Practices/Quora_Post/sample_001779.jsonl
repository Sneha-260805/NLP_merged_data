I sleep better, have more energy, and generally feel more centered. It also helps me manage my lower back pain which used to flare up after long hours at my desk. This Diwali, I'm gifting a yoga starter kit to my aunt, she's always complaining about joint pain. Maybe she'll finally understand what all the fuss is about! tenth march two thousand and twenty four is when I'm starting a new advanced Yoga session! Highly recommend giving yoga a try; it could be a game-changer for you too."}
