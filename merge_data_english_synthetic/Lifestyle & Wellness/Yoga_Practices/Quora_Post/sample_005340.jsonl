I start my day around zero six hundred hours with Surya Namaskar – even just five rounds make a huge difference in my energy levels. After that, I focus on Pranayama. Anulom Vilom is my go-to, especially when I'm feeling stressed about deadlines (which happens quite often at I N F O S Y S!). I learned it from a yoga instructor who used to conduct sessions at our office canteen on Wednesdays."}
{"unnormalised": "**Answer:**", "normalised": "Then there's Asana. I'm still a beginner, but I try to incorporate Trikonasana and Virabhadrasana into my routine thrice a week. My lower back used to bother me a lot due to long hours sitting at my desk, but these have really helped strengthen it. I also try to squeeze in a thirty minute session of Yoga Nidra before bed; it does wonders for calming my mind. I aim to do this daily, starting tenth october two thousand and twenty four."}

I often reflect on the teachings of Patanjali during my commute. It's not just about physical fitness; it's about finding inner peace.

If you are looking to improve your overall well-being, I highly recommend exploring yoga."}
