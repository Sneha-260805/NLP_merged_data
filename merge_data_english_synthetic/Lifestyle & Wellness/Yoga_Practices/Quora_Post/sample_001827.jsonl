My grandmother, Dadi, who lived till she was 95, always emphasized that yoga is a holistic approach to wellness.

Now, I realize it's about connecting with your body and mind. It is a powerful tool to manage stress, improve flexibility and gain clarity of thought. I try to practice at least 3 times a week, focusing on different aspects each time.", "normalised": "I remember starting yoga seriously only after my knee injury in two thousand and eighteen.

On 26/01/2023, I learned a new breathing technique during a workshop in Rishikesh. It’s these small discoveries that keep me motivated. Even 15 minutes of mindful breathing can make a huge difference. It’s a tradition spanning thousands of years in India.", "normalised": "One thing I wish more people understood is that yoga is not a competition. It's a personal journey.
