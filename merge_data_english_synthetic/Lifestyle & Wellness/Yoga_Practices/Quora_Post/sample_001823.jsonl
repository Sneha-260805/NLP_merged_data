Honestly, it's been a transformative journey, starting more out of desperation than inspiration! Back in two thousand and eighteen, I was working ten hour days at my I T job in Bangalore, hunched over a computer. My back was killing me, I was stressed beyond belief, and my doctor, Doctor Sharma, seriously suggested I consider yoga."}

I usually do a mix of Hatha and Yin yoga, focusing on breathwork (pranayama) learned during a weekend retreat I attended at Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore on fifteenth march two thousand and twenty. It's not just about the physical postures (asanas); it's about connecting with yourself, finding that inner peace that helps you navigate the chaos of everyday life in India. Believe me, navigating Bangalore traffic at nine hundred hours requires a zen-like calm! Yoga gave me that."}
