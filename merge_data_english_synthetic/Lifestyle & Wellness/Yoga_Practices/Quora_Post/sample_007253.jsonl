Dr. Sharma down the street from me runs some excellent sessions. It usually costs around Rs. 500 per class. Trust me, it's worth the investment in your well-being. You can even practice simple stretches while watching your favourite Bollywood film. Shanti!", "normalised": "Pro-tip: Check if there are any local yoga classes near you.
