My back was screaming, my stress levels were through the roof, and I was generally feeling like a tightly wound spring ready to snap.

{"unnormalised": "I started with basic Hatha yoga classes at a local center, guided by a wonderfully patient instructor named Priya. The initial days were tough. I could barely touch my toes, and my balance resembled that of a newborn giraffe. Remember Hrithik Roshan's initial dancing woes in \"Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai?\" That was me trying to do a simple downward-facing dog!", "normalised": "I started with basic Hatha yoga classes at a local center, guided by a wonderfully patient instructor named Priya.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I'm no expert yogi by any means. I still struggle with certain poses, and I definitely can't hold a headstand for more than 5 seconds without collapsing. But the journey has been incredibly rewarding. I even visited the Bihar School of Yoga in Munger last year and that changed my whole perspective. Yoga isn't just about physical postures; it's a way of life. It's about finding inner peace and balance, and it's something I'm committed to continuing.
