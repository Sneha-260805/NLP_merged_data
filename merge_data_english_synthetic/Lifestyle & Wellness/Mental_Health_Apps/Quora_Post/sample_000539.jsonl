{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately, especially with the crazy pace of life in Mumbai. Are these mental health apps *really* doing anything beneficial?", "normalised": "Honestly, it is a mixed bag. Some apps offer guided meditations – think Headspace or Calm but perhaps tailored for Indian users with content referencing, say, the Bhagavad Gita. These can be genuinely helpful for stress relief, especially when you are crammed into a local train or stuck in traffic near Dadar. My cousin, Priya, swears by one; she says it helps her manage her anxiety before big presentations at her I T company in Bangalore."}

Simply logging your feelings does not automatically solve anything. Also, I am wary of apps claiming to offer therapy without a properly licensed therapist on the other end. Imagine getting advice from an A I designed in a five hundred square feet office in Gurgaon! No offense, but Doctor Sharma's experience treating patients for twenty years is irreplaceable."}

They can be useful alongside professional help, not as a replacement. Think of them as a stepping stone, or a supplement to your existing wellness routine. They should not be used in place of actual therapy or medication. Do your research, read reviews (especially Indian ones mentioning specific cultural nuances), and be wary of apps that promise unrealistic results or ask for exorbitant amounts of rupees before you have even tried them. Are they a fad? Maybe for some, but if used responsibly, they can provide some support on your mental wellness journey."}
