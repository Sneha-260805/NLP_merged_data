{"unnormalised": "Well, the answer is complex. On one hand, apps like Headspace, Calm, and even some locally developed ones like Evolve, offer guided meditations, mindfulness exercises, and mood tracking. They can provide accessible and convenient support, especially for people in remote areas like, say, Ladakh, where access to therapists might be limited. Some apps also incorporate elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a proven method. NIMHANS in Bangalore is doing some interesting research on the efficacy of app-based interventions, so keep an eye out for their findings.", "normalised": "Well, the answer is complex.

Remember the movie 'Dear Zindagi'? Alia Bhatt's character sought help from a real therapist. While apps are useful tools, that human connection remains crucial for genuine healing. So, use them wisely, folks, as a supplement to – not a substitute for – proper mental healthcare.", "normalised": "Finally, data privacy is a major concern.
