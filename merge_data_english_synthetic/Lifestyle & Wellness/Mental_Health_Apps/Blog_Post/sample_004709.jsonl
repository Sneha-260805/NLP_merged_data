{"unnormalised": "The truth, like the nuanced characters in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, lies somewhere in between. Mental health apps offer accessibility and convenience. Imagine feeling anxious before a big presentation at IIT Delhi and having a guided meditation app like Headspace available on your phone. Or tracking your mood daily using an app like Moodpath, helping you identify triggers and patterns. They provide tools for self-monitoring, mindfulness exercises, and even connect you with online therapists, sometimes at a lower cost than traditional therapy.", "normalised": "the truth, like the nuanced characters in zindagi na milegi dobara, lies somewhere in between. mental health apps offer accessibility and convenience. imagine feeling anxious before a big presentation at I I T delhi and having a guided meditation app like headspace available on your phone. or tracking your mood daily using an app like moodpath, helping you identify triggers and patterns. they provide tools for self-monitoring, mindfulness exercises, and even connect you with online therapists, sometimes at a lower cost than traditional therapy."}

Think of it as similar to using home remedies for a cold – they can provide relief for mild symptoms, but you need a doctor for a serious infection. Many apps haven’t been rigorously studied, and the quality can vary widely. It's important to choose apps that are evidence-based and developed with input from mental health professionals.

But treat them as supplementary to, not a substitute for, professional guidance when needed. Just like Shah Rukh Khan’s character in Dear Zindagi discovers, true healing often requires deeper connection and expert help.
