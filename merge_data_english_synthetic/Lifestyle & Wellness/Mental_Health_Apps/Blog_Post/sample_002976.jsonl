{"unnormalised": "Don't be afraid to explore! Mental health is just as important as physical health. Think of these apps as your personal gym for your mind. And just like you wouldn't expect to see results after one workout, it takes consistent effort to reap the benefits. Maybe dedicate 15 minutes a day, just a small corner of your 1000 sq ft apartment, to some mindful practice. Even small improvements can make a huge difference. A little investment (some are even free, or offer affordable subscriptions starting from Rs. 200 per month) can go a long way. You deserve it! Consider it a small price to pay for a healthier, happier you. Good luck, and take care!", "normalised": "Do not be afraid to explore! Mental health is just as important as physical health.
