First off, whispers are swirling about Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor maybe, just maybe, planning a grand anniversary bash in Udaipur? A source close to the Kapoor khandaan says they're scouting locations and apparently, Neetu Singh is all over the details, making sure everything is 'perfectly perfect.'

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole saga with Janhvi Kapoor and… well, let's just call him \"Mr. Mystery Man.\" Paparazzi pics surfaced of them leaving a Juhu restaurant at 2 AM, holding hands! Is this a new romance brewing? Or just friendly hand-holding after too many butter chickens? The nation wants to know! My prediction? He's either a tech entrepreneur or secretly, a sheikh from Dubai visiting Mumbai on a business trip.

Well, a little birdie (aka my friend who works as a light boy on sets) told me that the negotiations are still ON! Apparently, the script is inspired by some old Mughal tale, and it’s HUGE. Like, *Bahubali* huge, but with more drama, more eyeliner, and definitely more over-the-top costumes.
