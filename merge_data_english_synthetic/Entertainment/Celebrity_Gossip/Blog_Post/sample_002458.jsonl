{"unnormalised": "First up, the rumour mill is churning faster than a lassi maker at a Delhi summer fair, suggesting that Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are expecting… a second papad! Sources close to the couple, reportedly overheard during a private dinner at Olive Bar & Kitchen in Bandra, claim Alia was craving nothing but imarti and pickles. Coincidence? We think NOT! (Though maybe she just really likes imarti and pickles, who are we to judge? But where's the fun in that?)", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Meanwhile, across the Arabian Sea in Goa, things are getting even wilder. Apparently, Ranveer Singh was spotted at a beach shack, not just enjoying a leisurely Kingfisher, but *actually* helping a group of fisherfolk pull in their nets! A source, identified only as \"Ganesh from Panjim,\" claims Ranveer was wearing a shimmering silver lungi and yelling encouragement in fluent Konkani. Now, whether this is a publicity stunt or just Ranveer embracing his inner fisherman is yet to be determined. We're leaning towards the former. It's Ranveer.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "And finally, the biggest bombshell of the week: Deepika Padukone was allegedly seen sneaking into a small dhaba in Chandigarh with… wait for it… Virat Kohli! Both were disguised (poorly, might I add, considering Deepika's signature cheekbones are harder to hide than SRK's mansion), and reportedly devoured a whole tandoori chicken between them. This has sent social media into a TIZZY. Are they collaborating on a new project? Is this just a friendly Biryani summit? Or is there something… *more*?", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Speaking of food, the Onam celebrations at Karan Johar's house were reportedly off the charts. Apparently, even Malaika Arora, who usually survives on kale smoothies and air, was spotted piling her plate high with avial and sambar. See? Even Bollywood divas can't resist a good festive feast!", "normalised": ""}
