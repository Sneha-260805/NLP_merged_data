{"unnormalised": "First up, Ranbir Kapoor. Sources (my aunty, basically, who delivers flowers to Karan Johar's building) are whispering that he's been spotted near Deepika Padukone's Bandra apartment… like, A LOT. Now, Alia's currently shooting in London, and we all know a man alone is basically a moth to a flame. But is it LOVE? Nah. More likely he’s just got a serious craving for Deepika’s famous masala dosa. My sources also say she makes an amazing sambar. Priorities, people!", "normalised": "First up, Ranbir Kapoor.

Witnesses (read: the caterers who overheard everything) report a tense moment over who gets the last gulab jamun. Seriously, a gulab jamun? People nearly started World War III over a pastry? It’s almost as dramatic as an Ekta Kapoor serial. Maybe Nick needs to learn a bit about Indian wedding etiquette - the bride's side ALWAYS wins.", "normalised": "Then there's Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas.

My barber, who cuts his hair sometimes, said he saw him with a script that looked suspiciously like a rom-com. Is the King of Romance back? Only time (and a few more scoops from my reliable sources) will tell!
