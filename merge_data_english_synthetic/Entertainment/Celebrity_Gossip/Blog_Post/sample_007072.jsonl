(And Other Spicy Chai)**", "normalised": "Okay Bollywood buffs, grab your chai and settle in, because the goss is PIPING hot today! First up, remember that Diwali bash at Ambani's Antilia? Apparently, things got a little awkward between Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's sister, Shaheen. Sources close to the party (aunties who overheard whispered conversations near the samosa stand, to be precise) are saying Ranbir totally friendzoned her after she apparently flirted with him relentlessly. Ouch! Talk about a family drama worthy of a Karan Johar film. Is this the end of Bhai Dooj celebrations forever? We shall see."}
