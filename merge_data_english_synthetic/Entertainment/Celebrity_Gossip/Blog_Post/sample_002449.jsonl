{"unnormalised": "First up, rumors are flying faster than a Mumbai local during rush hour about Ranbir's supposed *faux pas* at Karan Johar's Diwali bash. Apparently, he accidentally called Alia \"Deepika\"… again! Some sources (read: the auntyjis I overheard at the local sabzi mandi) claim it's a Freudian slip. Others say he was just really into the Diwali lights and everything just looked…shiny. Either way, the internet's having a field day. Poor Ranbir, maybe he needs a GPS to track his exes in his memory.", "normalised": "First up, rumors are flying faster than a Mumbai local during rush hour about Ranbir's supposed *faux pas* at Karan Johar's Diwali bash.

{"unnormalised": "And speaking of suspense, the whole nation is holding its breath waiting to see if Deepika and Ranveer will finally announce that new film together. They haven’t shared screen space for what feels like 5 years, which in Bollywood years, is practically a lifetime! Someone needs to serve them a massive plate of biryani and lock them in a room until they agree to a project. Seriously, I’d pay good money to see that!", "normalised": "And speaking of suspense, the whole nation is holding its breath waiting to see if Deepika and Ranveer will finally announce that new film together.
