{"unnormalised": "Next up, is there trouble in paradise for Deepika and Ranveer? A blind item on Pinkvilla suggested a power couple is on the verge of a split, and the internet sleuths went WILD.

Apparently, everyone from Karan Johar to Ananya Pandey is on the guest list. Expect lots of blurry pap photos and questionable dance moves. I'm already preparing my “stunning” outfit – a borrowed saree and a whole lot of hope. Stay tuned for more updates! Don't forget to follow for more Bollywood masala! Is this the end?
