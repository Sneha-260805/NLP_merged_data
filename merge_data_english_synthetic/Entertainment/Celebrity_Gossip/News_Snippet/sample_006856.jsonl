Did Ranbir Kapoor just confirm Alia Bhatt's pregnancy rumors?! Spotted: Ranbir and Alia at Akash Ambani's bash looking absolutely radiant. But fans are going wild after Ranbir seemingly cradled Alia's stomach for a fleeting moment! Is the Junior Kapoor on the way? Adding fuel to the fire, sources close to the family claim Alia has been skipping her yoga sessions at Bandra's Ashtanga Yoga Centre for \"health reasons\". Hmmm…suspicious, no? Remember the \"Brahmastra\" promotions where Alia looked a bit under the weather? Now it all makes sense! Meanwhile, Deepika Padukone liked a fan comment speculating about the pregnancy. Talk about throwing shade (or support?)! The Kapoors and Bhatts are notoriously tight-lipped, so we might not get an official announcement any time soon. But keep your eyes peeled! We're expecting some major Bollywood baby news coming our way. Stay tuned for updates, folks! This is juicier than Jalebi!"}
