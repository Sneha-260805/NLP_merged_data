Sources close to the Kapoor family are whispering louder than ever! Apparently, things aren't all hearts and roses after the \"Brahmastra\" success party. Word is, Alia's been spending more time at her mom Soni Razdan's Bandra pad, and Ranbir's been spotted chilling with Vicky Kaushal at Olive a lot. Insiders are saying a potential \"creative difference\" regarding upcoming projects might be the culprit. Remember that Karan Johar flick they were supposed to co-star in? Yeah, maybe scratch that. And get this: There's even been speculation about a possible link to a certain Miss Padukone making a recent appearance at the Ambani's bash! Coincidence? We think not! Fueling the fire, Ranbir was seen leaving Lilavati Hospital yesterday – no comment from his team yet on the purpose of the visit. Is this just regular relationship turbulence or something more serious? Stay tuned, folks! We're on the case! We promise to keep you updated."}
