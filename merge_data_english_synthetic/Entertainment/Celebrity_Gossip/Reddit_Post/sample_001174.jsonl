I heard some massive whispers coming out of Dharma Productions after Karan Johar's Diwali bash. Apparently, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt weren't exactly lovey-dovey.

And did anyone see Ananya Pandey arrive with Aditya Roy Kapoor? They looked very comfortable together. Is this the new 'it' couple we didn't see coming? Move over, Ranveer-Deepika! (Just kidding... mostly). Also, spotted: Shahid Kapoor looking seriously ripped. Man's been hitting the gym, probably training for another Kabir Singh-esque role. On a completely different note, there’s buzz that Priyanka Chopra is planning a big party in Mumbai next month. Rumor has it she's trying to rope in S R K. Imagine the pictures! Would be legendary. Anyone have any other juicy bits they want to share? No chugli is too small! Let's get this thread poppin'."}
