I heard from my cousin's friend who works near Film City that Ranbir and Alia have been secretly attending couples counseling at a place called \"The Relationship Repair Kendra\" in Bandra. Apparently, they are trying to \"find balance\" between their hectic schedules and Raha's upbringing. Source? My cousin's friend, obviously. Take it with a pinch of haldi! Also, anyone else think Janhvi Kapoor is subtly hinting at a relationship with that mysterious N R I businessman she was spotted with at Ambani's pre-wedding bash? She has been dropping cryptic Instagram stories with lines from *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* lately - major S R K vibes, right? On a different note, remember when Kangana Ranaut and Karan Johar almost had a face-off at the National Film Awards ceremony? I heard the tension was so thick you could cut it with a naan. I bet Anupam Kher was loving every minute of it. Speaking of controversies, has anyone actually seen the extended cut of *Animal* yet? Apparently, it adds like, twenty kilometer of unnecessary violence. Yikes! Thoughts? What other masala goss is brewing? Do not be shy, share the tea! Let us get this Bollywood gossip train rolling! Toot toot! 🚂"}
