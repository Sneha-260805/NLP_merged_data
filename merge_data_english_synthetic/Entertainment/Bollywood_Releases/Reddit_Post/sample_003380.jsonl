{"unnormalised": "Finally, keep an eye out for Dr. Sharma's directorial debut, a small independent film called \"Ganga Kinare.\" It's playing at the Mumbai Film Festival this week. I heard it's about finding inner peace in Varanasi, which, after dealing with Mumbai traffic for 2 hrs, sounds divine. It's supposed to be filmed in a tiny 500 sq ft apartment in Benaras, and budget was around Rs. 50 Lakhs. Anyone planning to go to the festival? Let me know what you think! What are your picks? Konkani film industry also has few releases this week.
