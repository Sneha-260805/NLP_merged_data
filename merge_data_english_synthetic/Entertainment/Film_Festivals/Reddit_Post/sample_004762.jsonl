I swear, I saw more films about existential dread and questionable camera angles than I've seen in my entire life.

But seriously, next time, can we get more vada pav and less avant-garde despair? My stomach demands satisfaction after watching 3 hours of shaky-cam art house films. Five stars for ambition, two stars for snack provision. Will attend again, purely for the chaotic energy. Send help (and snacks).", "normalised": "The free chai was great, though.
