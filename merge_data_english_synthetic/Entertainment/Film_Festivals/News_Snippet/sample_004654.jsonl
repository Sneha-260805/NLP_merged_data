Forget your O T T platforms for a week, because it is all about the big screen and indie darlings. Word on the street is, the Kolkata International Film Festival is gearing up for another banger edition in November. Expect a heady mix of Tollywood talent and global cinema. But it is not just Kolkata! Smaller fests are popping up all over, giving new filmmakers a much-needed platform. We are talking screenings in quaint little towns you have probably never heard of – think hidden gems and chai breaks instead of red carpets and champagne (though maybe some masala chai is champagne-worthy!). And speaking of food, don't forget the food stalls at these festivals! Nothing beats enjoying a hot plate of biryani while debating the merits of a long, slow burn versus a jump-scare horror film. Or perhaps you are in Kerala and are enjoying a scrumptious Onam Sadhya while talking films. So, ditch Netflix this season and support some cinema! You might just discover the next Anurag Kashyap."}
