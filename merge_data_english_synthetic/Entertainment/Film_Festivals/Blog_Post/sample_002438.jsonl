Think beyond Karan Johar's latest romance and into a world of thought-provoking documentaries, experimental shorts, and powerful stories from corners of India (and the world!) you’ve never even heard of."}

Every year, it brings a curated selection of Indian and international films to the Maximum City. It's a great place to catch premieres, attend Q and A's with directors, and network with other film buffs. Imagine bumping into Anurag Kashyap while grabbing a vada pav during the festival – that’s the kind of magic we're talking about!"}

Well, these festivals offer a glimpse into different cultures, perspectives, and filmmaking styles. You might stumble upon the next Satyajit Ray, or a film that completely changes your perspective. Plus, it's a fantastic way to support independent filmmakers and help them get their work seen. You get bragging rights about seeing it before it goes viral, or gets picked up by Netflix."}

You might just discover your new favourite filmmaker or a story that stays with you long after the credits roll. And who knows, maybe you'll even be inspired to make your own film! Just remember to budget around rupees two thousand to five thousand for passes and snacks. And don't forget your sunscreen if you're heading to Goa – that sun can be brutal, even in December! Happy watching!"}
