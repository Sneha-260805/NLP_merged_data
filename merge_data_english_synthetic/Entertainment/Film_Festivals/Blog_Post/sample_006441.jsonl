There are tons happening all over India, from small regional ones showcasing local talent to larger international events that attract filmmakers from across the globe. Do a little research, pack your bags, and get ready to immerse yourself in the magic of cinema! You might discover your new favorite film, or even the next big thing in Indian cinema. Who knows, maybe I will see you there! It is worth travelling two hundred kilometer for some of them."}
