{"unnormalised": "But what’s so great about them, right? Well, for starters, you get to see films before everyone else, sometimes years before they hit streaming. You're also supporting independent filmmakers, the folks who are pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Plus, the networking opportunities are insane! Meeting other film lovers, industry professionals, maybe even landing your dream job – it's all in the realm of possibility.", "normalised": "But what’s so great about them, right?

{"unnormalised": "So, do some digging, find a film festival near you (or plan a trip!), and prepare to have your cinematic horizons expanded. You might just discover your new favorite filmmaker or, at the very least, have a ridiculously awesome weekend. Trust me, it's an experience you won't regret. Especially if you can score a 1000 Rs all-access pass! Just remember to book accommodation beforehand – Goa during IFFI gets crazy! And maybe pack a comfy shawl for those late-night screenings - the AC can be brutal.
