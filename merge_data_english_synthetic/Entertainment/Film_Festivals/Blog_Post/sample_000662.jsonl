They're vibrant celebrations of filmmaking, a melting pot of creativity where emerging talents rub shoulders with established directors.

{"unnormalised": "But it's not just about the famous names. Film festivals are a fantastic way to discover hidden gems. You might stumble upon a powerful documentary from a filmmaker in Jharkhand, or an experimental short film exploring themes you've never considered. Remember how everyone raved about \"Gully Boy\"? Films like that often find their initial audience through these festivals, building buzz before hitting the big screen.", "normalised": "But it's not just about the famous names.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the films themselves, attending a festival is an experience. Imagine discussing the themes of a film over chai with the director, or debating the merits of a particular performance with fellow movie lovers.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: catching a movie at a film festival is like eating home-cooked food instead of ordering from Zomato. It’s more authentic, more nourishing for the soul, and probably a lot more interesting! So, next time a film festival rolls into your city (or nearby – some are even worth travelling 500 km for!), check out the schedule. You might just discover your new favorite film, and maybe even a new perspective on the world. Tickets often start at Rs. 200, so it's pretty budget friendly too! See you at the movies!", "normalised": "Think of it this way: catching a movie at a film festival is like eating home-cooked food instead of ordering from Zomato.
