{"unnormalised": "I remember attending the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) back in 2018. Seriously, the sheer volume of films being screened was insane!

Places like the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) often showcase their student films at these festivals, giving these future directors a huge boost.

You might just discover your new favorite filmmaker or stumble upon a film that changes your perspective on everything. Who knows, maybe you'll even be inspired to make your own! Just remember to book your tickets early, they go faster than pani puri on a hot Delhi day! You could spend Rs. 500 and watch 5 amazing films! That's a bargain. They also happen in other places too - some are 200km away. Just saying.", "normalised": "So, next time you're looking for something to do, ditch the predictable movie night and check out a film festival near you.
