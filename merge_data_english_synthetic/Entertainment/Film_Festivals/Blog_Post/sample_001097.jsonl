{"unnormalised": "And it's not just for filmmakers and industry types. Film festivals are for anyone who loves stories told visually. They offer a different perspective, challenge your thinking, and introduce you to cultures and ideas you might never have encountered otherwise. Imagine watching a film from, say, Burkina Faso, and suddenly understanding something new about the human condition.

{"unnormalised": "Whether it's the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa, the Mumbai Film Festival, or even smaller, more localized events, film festivals are totally worth checking out. Just be prepared to be inspired, challenged, and maybe even a little overwhelmed. Oh, and bring comfortable shoes. You'll be doing a lot of walking – especially if you want to grab some amazing street food in between screenings. Trust me, the momos near the Metro station were to die for, even if they were like 200 km away from my hotel. You might even discover the next *Lagaan* amongst the entries! Go on, give it a try!", "normalised": "Whether it's the International Film Festival of India (I F F I) in Goa, the Mumbai Film Festival, or even smaller, more localized events, film festivals are totally worth checking out.
