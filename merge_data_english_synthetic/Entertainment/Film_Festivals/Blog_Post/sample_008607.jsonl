{"unnormalised": "Besides the sheer volume of movies, film festivals are incredible for discovering new talent. Aspiring directors, actors, and writers get a platform to showcase their work and connect with industry professionals. Think of it as a launchpad – like how some say Anurag Kashyap got his start from such forums.

Next time IFFI rolls around, or even a smaller local festival like the Mumbai Film Festival, check it out! You might just discover your new favorite film – and maybe even a celebrity or two. Plus, Goa's a great escape, right? About 1500 km from Mumbai, and totally worth the travel time! See you there, maybe? Just keep an eye out for my paparazzi photos, hehe!", "normalised": "So, are film festivals just for serious film snobs? Nah! They are for anyone who loves movies and wants to explore something new.
