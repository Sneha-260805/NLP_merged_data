{"unnormalised": "So next time you're looking for something different to do, skip the same old mall and check out a film festival near you. You might just discover your new favorite film...or at least get some great content for your Instagram feed. Just remember to check the schedule and book your tickets in advance! Some of the smaller festivals have limited seats or are in halls that can only seat 50 people or so.
