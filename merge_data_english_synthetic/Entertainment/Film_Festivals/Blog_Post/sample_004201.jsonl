{"unnormalised": "India has some fantastic film festivals! From the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa – a classic that attracts filmmakers from across the globe - to smaller, regional fests showcasing local talent, there's something for everyone. I remember attending the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF) a few years back. I caught a screening of a low-budget Marathi film that blew me away. It was raw, honest, and tackled social issues with a depth I hadn't seen in mainstream Bollywood for ages. No item numbers, just pure, unfiltered storytelling. Reminded me of the kind of raw storytelling in early Anurag Kashyap films.", "normalised": "India has some fantastic film festivals!

Maybe you'll even discover the next big thing in Indian cinema, or simply find a new favorite film that stays with you long after the credits roll. So, next time you're looking for something to do, skip the multiplex and check out your local film festival. You might just be surprised at what you find. Plus, you can usually find tickets for around Rs. 200-500 per screening, depending on the festival. Definitely worth the price! Many film festivals are held in places within a 500km radius. Go find one and let me know what you discover!", "normalised": "Attending a film festival is an experience.
