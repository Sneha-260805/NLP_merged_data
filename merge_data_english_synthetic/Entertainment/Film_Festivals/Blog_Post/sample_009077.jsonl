Popcorn, over-the-top masala flicks, and maybe a Hollywood blockbuster if you're feeling adventurous?

From Cannes to Goa, these events offer a curated selection of films you likely wouldn't see anywhere else. We're talking independent films, documentaries that'll blow your mind, shorts that pack a punch, and world cinema that'll expand your horizons faster than a rickshaw ride through Mumbai in peak hour.", "normalised": "Think of film festivals as a vibrant cultural mela dedicated to the art of filmmaking.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the networking and celebrity spotting, film festivals offer a unique cinematic experience. You’re not just watching a movie, you're engaging in a dialogue. Often, there are Q&A sessions after screenings, providing valuable insights into the filmmaker's vision and the story behind the story. Plus, the sheer variety is mind-boggling. You can catch a gritty documentary about farmers in Rajasthan, a quirky animated short from Japan, and a thought-provoking drama from Kerala, all in the same day.", "normalised": "Beyond the networking and celebrity spotting, film festivals offer a unique cinematic experience.
