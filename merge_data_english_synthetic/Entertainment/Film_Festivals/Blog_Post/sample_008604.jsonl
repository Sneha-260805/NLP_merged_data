So next time you're looking for a cinematic adventure, ditch the usual suspects and check out a film festival near you. You might just discover your new favourite filmmaker or an unexpected gem that stays with you long after the credits roll. Plus, Goa’s always a good idea, right? I spent roughly Rs. 5,000 on food and travel and it was totally worth it. The distance from Panjim to the venue was approximately 10 km.
