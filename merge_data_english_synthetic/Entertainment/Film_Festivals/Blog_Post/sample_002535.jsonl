{"unnormalised": "Why should you attend a film festival? Well, for starters, you get to see films that are actually *good*! Okay, okay, I’m being dramatic, but seriously, you’re exposed to stories and perspectives you’d never encounter otherwise. Plus, you get to rub shoulders with filmmakers, actors, and fellow film enthusiasts. It’s a great opportunity to network, learn, and maybe even discover the next big thing in cinema. Remember that small film *Lagaan* that no one thought would become a hit? Film festivals can be launching pads for such gems!", "normalised": "Why should you attend a film festival?

{"unnormalised": "The next time you're looking for something to do, skip the usual movie night and check out a local film festival. You might just discover your new favorite filmmaker, a groundbreaking film, or even a whole new world of cinema. Plus, the chai and samosas at the after-parties are pretty darn good too! Keep an eye out for dates, often in October-November for the big ones. Tickets are usually priced between Rs. 500- Rs. 2000 for a day pass, depending on the festival. And remember to book early, they sell out fast! You might have to travel a bit, say 500 km to attend a good one, but it's worth it!", "normalised": "The next time you're looking for something to do, skip the usual movie night and check out a local film festival.
