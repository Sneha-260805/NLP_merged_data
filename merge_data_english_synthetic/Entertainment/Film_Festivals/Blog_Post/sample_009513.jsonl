Ever wondered what goes on *beyond* the red carpet glamour and perfectly posed pictures at film festivals? It's way more than just that, trust me. Imagine a giant mela, but instead of chaat stalls, it's all about movies, movies, and MORE movies!"}

I saw movies I *never* would have found on N E T F L I X or in P V R. Short films, documentaries, animation... the variety was insane! It's like discovering hidden gems. Remember that feeling when you first watched \"Dil Chahta Hai\" and realised Bollywood could be, like, *actually* cool? That's the vibe, but multiplied by one hundred!"}

Aspiring filmmakers get a chance to meet industry veterans, get feedback on their work, and maybe even score some funding.

Maybe check it out. You might just discover your new favourite director, a groundbreaking film that changes your perspective, or at least, get some amazing street food while celebrity spotting. Who knows? And yeah, don't forget to carry rupee five hundred for an auto ride cause getting a cab during these events is like finding a decent signal in a remote village in Bihar. Worth it though, one hundred percent! It’s usually around fifty kilometer from the airport. Think about it, you might just stumble upon the next big thing. Jai Hind!"}
