{"unnormalised": "India’s own International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa is a big one, of course. But there are tons more. The Mumbai Film Festival (MAMI) is fantastic, too, attracting a great mix of international and local talent. These fests screen everything from hard-hitting documentaries to quirky short films, and even the occasional blockbuster-in-the-making.

Plus, you get to participate in Q&As with directors, attend workshops, and generally geek out with fellow movie enthusiasts. The networking opportunities alone are worth the price of admission (usually a reasonable Rs. 500- Rs. 2000, depending on the festival).
