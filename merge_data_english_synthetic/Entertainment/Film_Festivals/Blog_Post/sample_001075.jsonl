I mean, sure, you’ll still find your share of thought-provoking dramas, but you also get amazing indie comedies, edge-of-your-seat thrillers, and even Bollywood-inspired masala flicks! I remember seeing this crazy action-comedy at the Kolkata International Film Festival last year – totally unexpected, but a complete riot!"}

Film festivals are a total *vibe*. They're a place to connect with other film lovers, debate the merits of different films over cups of chai, and maybe even network if you're looking to break into the industry yourself. They are organised in different cities, like I F F I in Goa. It’s a serious talent hub."}
