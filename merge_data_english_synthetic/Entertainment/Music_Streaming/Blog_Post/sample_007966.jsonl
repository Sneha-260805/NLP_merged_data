Remember the good ol' days when you had to schlep all the way to Rhythm House in Colaba, Mumbai, hoping they hadn't sold out of the Anu Malik cassette you desperately needed? Those were the dark ages, my friends. Now, with a few taps on my phone, I can have the entire Bollywood soundtrack of *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* and some obscure Rajasthani folk songs, all competing for space in my eardrums. It's glorious chaos."}

Plus, think of all the space I have saved by not needing to hoard physical C D s. My tiny Mumbai apartment thanks you, Spotify. Even if you *think* I need more Alka Yagnik in my life."}
