{"unnormalised": "Okay folks, let's be real. Remember the good old days when you bought a cassette for Rs. 50 and listened to \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" on repeat until the tape literally melted? Ah, simpler times. Now? I'm paying more for data so I can stream Arijit Singh on Spotify while battling peak hour traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway. It's progress, they say. I say it's highway robbery… of my bandwidth!", "normalised": "Okay folks, let us be real.

{"unnormalised": "Seriously, my data bill is giving me the side-eye harder than my mom when I told her I was going to IIT to study fine arts. Every month, it's the same story. I swear I'm only listening to, like, *two* hours of music a day. Two hours! That's less than it takes to navigate Connaught Place on a Sunday afternoon. But apparently, two hours of Sonu Nigam belting out tunes is enough to send my data usage soaring higher than Shah Rukh Khan in a Yash Chopra film.", "normalised": "Seriously, my data bill is giving me the side-eye harder than my mom when I told her I was going to I I T to study fine arts.

I mean, I appreciate the attempt, Spotify, but I'm not ready for a full-blown spiritual awakening during my morning chai. Just give me some Bollywood bangers, maybe a little Drake, and let's call it a day.", "normalised": "And don’t even get me started on the \"recommended\" playlists.

{"unnormalised": "The irony is, I'm paying for a \"premium\" experience, which apparently means I can listen to ad-free music while simultaneously hemorrhaging data. It's like paying for a fancy vada pav and then discovering the chutney is extra spicy and burns your tongue.

Or just accept my fate and start budgeting for a data plan that could rival the GDP of a small nation? Suggestions, people, suggestions! Because right now, my love for music streaming is being severely tested by the wrath of my telecom provider. And that, my friends, is no fun at all.", "normalised": "So, what is the solution?
