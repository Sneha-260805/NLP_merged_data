{"unnormalised": "My biggest gripe? The discovery. I mean, sure, I find new artists. But mostly, I discover how much I already liked the old artists. It’s like that feeling when you re-watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge – you know what's coming, but you still get emotional when Raj finally wins over Simran's Bauji. Except with music, it's more like, \"Oh, look, 'Chaiyya Chaiyya' again. Still a banger.\"", "normalised": "My biggest gripe? The discovery. I mean, sure, I find new artists.

{"unnormalised": "Don't get me wrong, I love the convenience. But sometimes, I miss the tactile joy of holding a CD, reading the liner notes, and judging the artist's questionable fashion choices. Maybe it's nostalgia. Or maybe, just maybe, the algorithm is trying to brainwash me with endless elevator music. Either way, my relationship with music streaming is definitely a rollercoaster, complete with dramatic twists and turns worthy of a Yash Chopra film. Is it love? Is it hate? Tune in next month for the sequel.", "normalised": "Don't get me wrong, I love the convenience.
