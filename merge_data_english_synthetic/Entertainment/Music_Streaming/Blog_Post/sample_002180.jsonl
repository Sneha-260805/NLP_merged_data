Cassettes tangled like Diwali lights, radio jingles stuck in your head for days, and buying C D's that cost more than a plate of butter chicken at Moti Mahal? Those were the days of limited choice, but unlimited patience. Now? We're drowning in an ocean of music thanks to streaming services, and frankly, my data pack is having an existential crisis."}

I mean, one song probably costs more data than an entire Govinda movie used to back in the nineties. And let’s not even TALK about high-definition audio. My phone's processor probably starts humming like a malfunctioning auto-rickshaw trying to climb a flyover in Mumbai."}

Maybe we all need to go back to listening to C D's and tapes. Nah, just kidding! My data pack might cry, but my ears are singing. Just gotta budget those precious G B's wisely. Maybe lay off the YouTube cat videos for a week. Maybe. Or maybe I’ll just ask Priya for her Jio hotspot password. Don't tell her I said that. And definitely don't tell Rohan. He'll start streaming his remixes even louder. God help us all."}
