You'd have to physically rewind (with a pencil if you were feeling *desi* frugal) and listen to the same Kishore Kumar song over and over. Now? We've got access to, like, a billion songs at our fingertips. Thanks, internet! But also, thanks for turning my phone bill into a monthly existential crisis.
