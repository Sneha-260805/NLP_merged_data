Gone are the days of painstakingly creating mixtapes for that special someone (remember burning CDs at 3 AM? Thanks, Kumar!), and we’ve supposedly evolved past even buying individual songs. Now it’s all about the mighty music streaming services. But are we *really* there yet? I have my doubts, and my constantly buffering Lata Mangeshkar playlist on my commute from Borivali to Bandra is testament to that.", "normalised": "okay, folks, let's talk music. specifically, how we actually listen to music these days. gone are the days of painstakingly creating mixtapes for that special someone (remember burning C D S at three A M? thanks, kumar!), and we’ve supposedly evolved past even buying individual songs. now it’s all about the mighty music streaming services. but are we really there yet? i have my doubts, and my constantly buffering lata mangeshkar playlist on my commute from borivali to bandra is testament to that."}

For roughly the price of, let's say, 3 plates of delicious pav bhaji (approximately Rs. 300, depending on your bargaining skills), you get access to millions of songs.
