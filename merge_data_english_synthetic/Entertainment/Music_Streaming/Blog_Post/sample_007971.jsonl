{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about the elephant in the room, or rather, the Lata Mangeshkar in my headphones: Music streaming. Remember the days of painstakingly ripping CDs onto your hard drive? Ah, the good ol' days when 128 kbps was considered \"high quality.\" My college library at IIT Delhi still probably has a computer humming away with all my illegally downloaded Bollywood tracks. Good times!", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about the elephant in the room, or rather, the Lata Mangeshkar in my headphones: Music streaming.

Seriously, Jio must think I'm single-handedly funding their 5G rollout with the sheer amount of streaming I do while stuck in Bangalore traffic.

{"unnormalised": "But let's be real, despite the data drain and the algorithmic meddling, I'm addicted. I can’t imagine life without instantly accessing every Anu Malik masterpiece (yes, even the questionable ones). Streaming services are our modern-day Tansen, captivating us with their sonic sorcery. And hey, at least I don't have to risk a pirated DVD giving my computer a virus anymore. That’s worth a few extra rupees on my bill, right?", "normalised": "But let's be real, despite the data drain and the algorithmic meddling, I'm addicted.
