Any recommendations for something reliable and relatively affordable? Transaction fees are a killer, right? I'm looking for something that supports U P I (obviously!), credit or debit cards, and maybe even wallets. Also, international payments are a must eventually, as I'm hoping to export some Banarasi silks. Security is a big concern too. I don't want to end up in any trouble like my friend Ravi did, his startup lost rupee fifty thousand to a scam last year. Any tips or warnings based on your own e-commerce journeys would be greatly appreciated! Dhanyavad in advance!\""}
