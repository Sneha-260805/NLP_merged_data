Thinking of revamping my online saree business, \"Silks of Kanchipuram,\" and I'm totally stuck on choosing a payment gateway. Right now, I'm using Razorpay, which is okay, but the transaction fees are starting to bite, especially with all the festive sales around Diwali. Anyone have experience with different payment gateways specifically for e-commerce in India? Heard good things about PayU and C C Avenue, but some reviews mention integration issues with Shopify (that's what I'm using!). Also, does anyone know if it's worth it to set up my own payment gateway (though that sounds like a massive headache)? Doctor Sharma from down the street mentioned something about P C I compliance being a nightmare. Thinking of expanding into a small brick-and-mortar store (maybe five hundred square feet in Connaught Place), so ideally, something that works both online and offline would be amazing. Customers prefer using U P I, but I'd also like to accept international payments (Missus Iyer has a lot of relatives abroad who want to buy silks!). Any recommendations based on your experience? Bonus points if it’s easy for my staff (mostly rural women) to use! And any idea on what are the typical charges (rupees per transaction) charged by other players. Thanks a ton!"}
