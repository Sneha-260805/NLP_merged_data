{"unnormalised": "Ideally, I'd love something as seamless as using BHIM for personal payments. Any recommendations, especially from those running similar businesses targeting smaller towns like Meerut and Kanpur? Which offers the best support in Hindi, if anything goes wrong? Maybe I'll name my first saree collection after a Bollywood classic like *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* if this goes well! Also, I'm registered as an MSME with the SIDBI, so any specific benefits relating to payment gateways I should be aware of? Thanks in advance for any help!", "normalised": "Ideally, I'd love something as seamless as using B H I M for personal payments.
