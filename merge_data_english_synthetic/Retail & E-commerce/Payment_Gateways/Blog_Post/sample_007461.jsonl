{"unnormalised": "There are tons of options out there, from the big boys like Razorpay and PayU to smaller, more niche players. Some charge a percentage per transaction (think of it like that commission aunty asks for finding you a suitable rishta), while others have fixed monthly fees. Rs. 2000 per month, maybe? Do your research! Compare their fees, their security features (nobody wants their customer data leaking out faster than gossip at a Delhi wedding), and their integration with your e-commerce platform.", "normalised": "There are tons of options out there, from the big boys like Razorpay and Pay U to smaller, more niche players.

{"unnormalised": "Remember, a clunky payment process is like serving cold biryani – nobody wants it! Make it seamless, secure, and maybe even offer a few options like UPI, net banking, and good old credit/debit cards. After all, you want to make it as easy as possible for your customers to part with their hard-earned rupees and shower you with online love (and orders, of course!). Happy selling, bhai! May your payment gateway always be up and your sales figures forever in double digits!", "normalised": "Remember, a clunky payment process is like serving cold biryani – nobody wants it!
