{"unnormalised": "What exactly *is* a payment gateway? Simple – it's the middleman between your website and the customer's bank. When someone clicks \"Pay Now\" after adding that beautiful saree or handcrafted wooden toy to their cart, the gateway securely transmits their card details (or UPI ID) to the bank for authorization.
