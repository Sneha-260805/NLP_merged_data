Think robust encryption, fraud detection, the whole nine yards. Then there's ease of use. Is it intuitive for the customer? Can they easily pay using their preferred method – UPI, credit card, net banking from SBI, or even that obscure e-wallet aunty uses?", "normalised": "So, what makes a good payment gateway?
