{"unnormalised": "Basically, a payment gateway is the middleman between your online store and the customer’s bank. When someone clicks that \"Pay Now\" button after carefully selecting their items (maybe even some delicious Hyderabadi biryani recipes you're selling as a digital download!), the payment gateway takes over. It encrypts the credit card or net banking details, sends them off to the bank for verification, and then relays back whether the payment was successful or not.

You want a gateway that's easily reachable when things go south. Imagine, it’s the peak of the festive season and customers can’t pay.
