{"unnormalised": "So, do your research! Compare the transaction fees (nobody likes hidden charges, especially not Uncle Rajesh!), security features, and integration options. A good payment gateway should integrate seamlessly with your website, like butter chicken with naan. It needs to be reliable, secure, and, let’s be honest, reasonably priced. Because at the end of the day, you want to be raking in the rupees, not crying over lost commissions. After all, that BMW isn't going to pay for itself! Make sure your checkout experience is smoother than Dosa batter, and get that money rolling in. Namaste!", "normalised": "So, do your research!
