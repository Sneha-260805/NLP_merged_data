When a customer, say, Priya from Delhi, adds a beautiful Kanjivaram silk saree to her cart and clicks \"Checkout,\" the payment gateway steps in. It encrypts her card details and sends them to the bank for authorization.

Does the gateway support U P I? Does it handle Ru Pay cards easily? These are vital for a smooth customer experience in India.
