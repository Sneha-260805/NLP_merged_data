You'd have to ask Aunty Preeti from Bangalore to send you a cheque for rupee two thousand five hundred, wait for it to clear, and then finally ship her the gorgeous Kanjeevaram. By then, she'd probably have changed her mind and bought it from her local store! Ain't nobody got time for that in this day and age of instant gratification."}
