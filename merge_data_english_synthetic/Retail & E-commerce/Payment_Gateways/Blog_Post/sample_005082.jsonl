It's the middleman (or middlewoman!) that securely processes credit card, debit card, U P I, and even net banking transactions online. It’s the virtual cash register for your digital dukan."}

Some gateways charge a percentage per transaction (say, two percent plus rupee ten per transaction), while others have flat monthly fees. Compare offers from Razorpay, PayU, and even your bank (like S B I or H D F C)."}
