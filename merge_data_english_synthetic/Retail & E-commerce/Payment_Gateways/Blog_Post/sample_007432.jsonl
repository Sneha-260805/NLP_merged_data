{"unnormalised": "Let's face it, running an online store these days without a decent payment gateway is like trying to sell biryani at an Onam Sadhya – completely out of place and likely to be ignored. Imagine poor Rajesh from Rajesh's Sarees, painstakingly built his e-commerce empire, only to be kneecapped by... *wait for it*... cash-on-delivery. Talk about a logistical nightmare, especially during Diwali rush!", "normalised": "Let's face it, running an online store these days without a decent payment gateway is like trying to sell biryani at an Onam Sadhya – completely out of place and likely to be ignored.

{"unnormalised": "Payment gateways, my friends, are the silent heroes of e-commerce, the Amitab Bachchans of online transactions. They're the digital bouncers, ensuring that your customer's hard-earned Rs. 5000 (or even Rs. 50!) safely makes its way from their bank account to yours without getting snatched by some cyber-dacoit lurking in the digital badlands. Think of them as the super-efficient auto-rickshaw drivers of the internet, navigating the chaotic lanes of banks and credit card companies.", "normalised": "Payment gateways, my friends, are the silent heroes of e-commerce, the Amitab Bachchans of online transactions.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right gateway is crucial. You wouldn't use a cycle to deliver goods to Mumbai from Kolkata, would you? Similarly, a dodgy gateway with high transaction fees and frequent downtimes can cripple your business faster than you can say \"Yeh dil maange more!\" Consider factors like transaction fees (some are shockingly high, like 5%!), security features, and integration ease. Can it seamlessly integrate with your Shopify store, or are you looking at a coding headache that would make even the IIT grads sweat?", "normalised": "Choosing the right gateway is crucial.

Or trendy phone cases to Gen Z glued to their Instagram in Bangalore using multiple digital wallets? Knowing your customer’s payment preferences is half the battle won. So, ditch the \"cash only, sir!\" mentality and embrace the world of seamless online transactions. Your customers (and your accountant!) will thank you for it. Now, go forth and conquer the e-commerce world! Just remember to choose wisely, or you might end up with a Gateway to…financial woes. Jai Hind!", "normalised": "Think about your target audience too.
