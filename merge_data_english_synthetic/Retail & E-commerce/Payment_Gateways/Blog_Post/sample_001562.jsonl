{"unnormalised": "Basically, a payment gateway securely processes online transactions. When a customer in, say, Chennai wants to buy your amazing handcrafted jhumkas, they enter their card details (or use UPI, net banking etc.) on your website. The gateway then encrypts this information and sends it to the bank for authorization. If everything checks out (enough money in the account, card is valid, etc.), the payment is approved, and the money is transferred to your account. Voila! Jhumkas sold, and you've made a sale!", "normalised": "Basically, a payment gateway securely processes online transactions.

Each has its own transaction fees (usually a small percentage, like 2% + Rs. 5 per transaction), setup costs (sometimes none!), and features. Some offer international payment processing, which is a big plus if you're planning on selling your goods to NRIs celebrating Diwali abroad.", "normalised": "Now, choosing the right payment gateway is crucial.
