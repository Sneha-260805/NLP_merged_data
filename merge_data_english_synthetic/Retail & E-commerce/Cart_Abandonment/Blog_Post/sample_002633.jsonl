You add it to your cart, maybe even a matching clutch (Rs. 999, tempting!), a pair of jhumkas... Suddenly, you're staring at a potential bill that could rival your monthly grocery budget from D-Mart. And then... *poof*. You vanish. The cart is abandoned. Your digital shopping basket looks like a Mumbai local train after 9 PM - full of good intentions, but ultimately, everyone's jumped off before the final destination.", "normalised": "Let's face it, we've all been there.

Or perhaps you realize you're meant to be saving for that dream trip to Kerala, not another kurta you'll probably wear once. Other times, it’s the hidden fees! Free shipping promised, but then a surprise \"convenience fee\" of Rs. 150 pops up at checkout?

Think free shipping, easy returns (because let's be honest, that \"size small\" is never *really* a size small), and a checkout process smoother than butter chicken. Happy selling, folks!
