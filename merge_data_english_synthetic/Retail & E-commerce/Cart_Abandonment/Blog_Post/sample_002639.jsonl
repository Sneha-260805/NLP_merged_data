You're browsing your favourite e-commerce site, diligently adding sarees for your mom, a snazzy kurta for your chacha, and maybe, just maybe, that ridiculously oversized Ganesh statue you've been eyeing for months (Rs. 5000? Worth it!). You reach the checkout, ready to punch in your UPI ID… and then, BAM! Distraction strikes. Your neighbour, aunty Padma, bursts in with a plate of freshly made, ghee-dripping laddoos.
