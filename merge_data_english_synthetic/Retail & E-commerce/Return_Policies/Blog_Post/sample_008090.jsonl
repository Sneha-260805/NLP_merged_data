{"unnormalised": "Consider this: I once bought a 'designer' rug (supposedly 100 sq ft according to the website) online. What arrived? Something that looked suspiciously like my grandma's doormat. Returning it was like navigating a bureaucratic maze worthy of a Dr. (Doctor!) in Political Science. Multiple phone calls, email threads longer than a Bollywood movie, and finally, a courier guy who showed up three days late with a broken cart. The refund? Still pending, possibly somewhere in the digital realms of the bank.

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the moral of this story, dear readers? Read the return policy before you buy *anything*. Seriously. It could save you from a week-long headache and the potential need to bribe a local goon to get your money back. Remember, a good return policy is like a perfectly brewed cup of chai – comforting, reliable, and essential for survival in the chaotic landscape of retail. And if all else fails, blame your brother's dog for eating the garment. Trust me, it works 50% of the time.
