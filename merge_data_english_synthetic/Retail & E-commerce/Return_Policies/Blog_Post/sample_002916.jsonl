{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, folks. Navigating return policies in the retail world can feel like trying to find a decent parking spot in Chandni Chowk on Diwali - utterly chaotic and slightly terrifying.

Now, the fun begins.", "normalised": "Let's be honest, folks.

{"unnormalised": "Remember that time I bought that \"genuine leather\" belt from a vendor at the Pushkar Camel Fair on 26/01/2023? Turns out \"genuine leather\" meant \"genuine plastic imitation of leather that cracks after three uses\". Trying to return *that* was a comedy of errors.

You finally upgrade to that fancy new phone at Croma after months of saving, only to find out the camera blurs everything unless you’re shooting at 03:00 AM.

{"unnormalised": "The key, my friends, is to read the fine print. ALL of it. Before you click \"Add to Cart,\" scan that return policy like your future depends on it. Is there a restocking fee? Do you need the original packaging, even if your dog decided it was a chew toy? Can you return it in person, or are you stuck navigating the labyrinthine world of return shipping labels and waiting in line at the post office at 10:00 hrs sharp?", "normalised": "The key, my friends, is to read the fine print.

Just maybe, keep a backup plan of chai and biscuits, just in case the return process drags on longer than a K serial.
