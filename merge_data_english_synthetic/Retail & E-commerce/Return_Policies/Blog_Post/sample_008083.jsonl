{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the classic \"conditions apply\" scenario. The website boasts “Full refund if unsatisfied!” but buried deep in the fine print, next to the terms and conditions about data privacy and alien abduction, is a clause stating the item must be returned in its original packaging, undamaged, and under the precise lunar phase during which it was purchased. Good luck with that, Rajesh!", "normalised": "Then there is the classic \"conditions apply\" scenario.

{"unnormalised": "Moral of the story? Read the Return Policy, people! Dr. Sharma always said, \"Prevention is better than cure.\" A few minutes spent scrutinizing the fine print can save you hours of frustration, Rs. 500 in auto rickshaw fares, and a whole lot of unnecessary stress. And maybe, just maybe, you'll finally find that perfect saree that actually fits. Or a wooden elephant that isn't made of cheap plastic and takes up 10 sq ft of your living room.", "normalised": "Moral of the story? Read the Return Policy, people!
