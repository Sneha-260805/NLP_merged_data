{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, folks, navigating return policies is more anxiety-inducing than trying to explain cricket rules to your non-desi NRI cousin. You buy that gorgeous lehenga online, picturing yourself twirling at your best friend Priya's wedding in Udaipur, only for it to arrive looking like it was stitched together by a particularly enthusiastic group of monkeys. Now you're stuck with a return. *Dun dun DUNNN!*", "normalised": "Let's be honest, folks, navigating return policies is more anxiety-inducing than trying to explain cricket rules to your non-desi N R I cousin.

{"unnormalised": "Every e-commerce site and brick-and-mortar store has its own version of 'Return Policy: The Musical'. Some are as generous as your Nani handing out laddus during Diwali, offering full refunds and free return shipping. Others? Well, let's just say dealing with them feels like trying to get your electricity bill rectified at the local MSEB office. Prepare for paperwork, confusing jargon, and a whole lot of waiting.", "normalised": "Every e-commerce site and brick and mortar store has its own version of 'Return Policy: The Musical'.

{"unnormalised": "Remember that time I bought a \"genuine leather\" wallet from Lajpat Nagar market for Rs. 500? Turns out, it was more \"genuine-ly plastic\".

{"unnormalised": "And online retailers! Some require you to repackage the item in its original packaging (good luck with that after ripping it open like a kid on Christmas morning!), others deduct \"restocking fees\" that could fund a small vacation to Goa.

{"unnormalised": "But fear not, desi shoppers! Before hitting that 'Buy Now' button, read the fine print. Know your rights! And maybe, just maybe, avoid buying \"imported silk sarees\" from vendors offering suspiciously low prices in Palika Bazaar. It's probably rayon. Trust me, I've been there. My aunt Usha’s tailoring shop is a testament to my bad online shopping decisions. It's now 500 sq ft filled with \"bargain\" fabric. And a lot of regret. May your returns be swift, your refunds be full, and may you never again accidentally order a size small kurta thinking it'll magically fit your frame. Namaste!", "normalised": "But fear not, desi shoppers! Before hitting that 'Buy Now' button, read the fine print. Know your rights!
