Others are as convoluted as a plotline from a Ekta Kapoor serial. You might find yourself jumping through hoops the size of Mumbai's potholes, providing photographic evidence, filling out forms that require a PhD in bureaucratic jargon, and explaining why the slightly faded colour on your new kurta is unacceptable (even though your chacha said it looked \"quite nice\").", "normalised": "Now, navigating return policies can be trickier than figuring out the I P L playoffs.
