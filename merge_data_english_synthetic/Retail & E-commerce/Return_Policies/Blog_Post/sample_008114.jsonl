You see that gorgeous anarkali online, picture yourself looking like Madhuri Dixit in it at your cousin Priya's wedding, click \"Add to Cart\" faster than you can say \"shaadi.\" It arrives, you try it on, and BAM! You resemble a heavily draped elephant, not a Bollywood queen. Return time!", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's be real. We've all been there.

{"unnormalised": "But hold your horses, beta! Navigating return policies these days is like trying to find a parking spot in Chandni Chowk on Diwali. A complete and utter *maara-maari*. One store says \"No returns on stitched items,\" another demands the original packaging, untouched since the day it was blessed by Lakshmi Mata herself. And don’t even get me STARTED on the online giants! They make you jump through more hoops than a circus performer in Mumbai.", "normalised": "But hold your horses, beta!

{"unnormalised": "Is it returnable? Exchangeable? Store credit only? Will you be charged a restocking fee equivalent to a week's worth of chai? These are the questions that plague our existence. I once bought a 'Genuine Pashmina' shawl from a street vendor near India Gate, only to discover (after attempting to clean it) that it was about as genuine as a politician's promise. Of course, no returns accepted. Lesson learned: Caveat emptor, my friends, caveat emptor!", "normalised": "Is it returnable? Exchangeable? Store credit only?

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s a desi to do? Read the fine print, folks. Read it like you’re preparing for your MBBS entrance exam. Ask questions! Harass the customer service reps (politely, of course – remember “Atithi Devo Bhava”?). And maybe, just maybe, you'll avoid ending up with a cupboard full of regrettable purchases and a return policy-induced migraine. Remember, even Dr. Sharma can't cure *that* headache! Speaking of doctors, that kurta I bought is way too tight! It only has 200 sq ft of breathable space! Need to return it. Wish me luck. The shop is 5km away and the return policy is stricter than my Dadi’s rules on dating. Rs. 50 bet its not happening.", "normalised": "So, what's a desi to do? Read the fine print, folks.
