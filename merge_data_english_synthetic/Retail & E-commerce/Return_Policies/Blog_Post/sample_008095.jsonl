{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about return policies. That sweet, sweet escape clause when your online shopping spree turns into a colossal \"Oh, no, baby what is you doin'?\" moment. We've all been there, haven't we? You spot that stunning saree online – \"Banarasi silk, authentic,\" the website screams. You imagine yourself dazzling at your cousin Priya's wedding in Delhi, turning heads like Madhuri Dixit. But then, it arrives. Turns out, \"authentic\" apparently translates to \"looks like it was woven by a team of squirrels using leftover Diwali lights and feels like sandpaper.\"", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about return policies.

Deciphering some of these return policies is harder than understanding why Rahul Gandhi trends on Twitter. \"Item must be returned in its original packaging, unworn, unwashed, and still possessing that faint scent of cardamom.\" Seriously?

{"unnormalised": "So, retailers, please, a little clarity, a little compassion. Make the return process less like navigating a bureaucratic nightmare in a government office and more like getting a refund from a friendly neighbourhood kirana store. After all, happy customers come back. And nobody wants a disgruntled aunty on their hands, armed with a poorly-fitting saree and a burning desire for revenge. Just ask my neighbour, Mrs. Sharma. The Great Kurti Debacle of '22 still haunts her to this day.", "normalised": "So, retailers, please, a little clarity, a little compassion.
