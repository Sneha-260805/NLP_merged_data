Luckily, the return was smooth. Remember Ramesh's struggle with that broken phone from Flipkart last year? He had to fight tooth and nail! I wish all retailers could adopt a no-hassle policy like that saree shop near Chandni Chowk. Makes life much easier, especially during festival shopping frenzies. Even returns after enjoying a plate of hot biryani shouldn't be a problem!", "normalised": "Hey guys, return policies are so crucial, right? Especially now with all the online shopping!
