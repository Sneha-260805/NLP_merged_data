{"unnormalised": "Arre yaar, return policies can be such a headache, no? I recently bought a saree online from a fancy shop for my sister-in-law, Priya, for Onam. Turns out the colour wasn't right. Thankfully, they had a good policy, unlike that local shop near Charbagh where they refuse returns even if the item is faulty! I hope more e-commerce sites are as hassle-free. Makes buying easier than getting good biryani in Delhi!", "normalised": "Arre yaar, return policies can be such a headache, no?
