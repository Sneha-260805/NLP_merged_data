Think of it like that Dussehra mela – everyone's rushing to grab the best deals before they vanish!", "normalised": "Let's break it down.

{"unnormalised": "For retailers, especially smaller businesses in places like Karol Bagh, Delhi, flash sales can be a lifesaver. They help clear out old inventory, boost cash flow (especially crucial during the lean months after Holi), and attract new customers. Imagine a saree shop owner, Mr. Sharma, using a 24-hour flash sale to clear out last year's designs and make space for the latest trends. Smart, right? Plus, it gets people talking and generates buzz around their brand.", "normalised": "For retailers, especially smaller businesses in places like Karol Bagh, Delhi, flash sales can be a lifesaver.

{"unnormalised": "However, there's a flip side. If not managed properly, flash sales can devalue your brand. Constantly offering massive discounts can train customers to only buy when items are on sale, which isn't sustainable in the long run. Think about it – if that kurta you bought last week for Rs. 2000 is now selling for Rs. 500 in a flash sale, you wouldn't be too happy, would you?", "normalised": "However, there's a flip side.

{"unnormalised": "So, are flash sales worth the hype? Yes, absolutely! But do your research, plan meticulously, and don’t compromise on quality. Use them strategically, like a Dr. prescribing just the right dose of medicine, to give your sales a healthy boost without harming your brand in the long run. Think carefully about the discounts you're offering, especially if you're selling handmade items from a small workshop of 500 sq ft. offered at your brick and mortar store at say, Commercial Street. After all, no one wants to feel like they’ve been ‘chuna lagaoed’!", "normalised": "So, are flash sales worth the hype? Yes, absolutely!
