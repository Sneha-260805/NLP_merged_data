{"unnormalised": "Think of it as a chai break for your wallet. A quick, potent dose of savings before you get back to the grind. From sarees at Nalli Silk to electronics on Flipkart, everyone's doing it. My Auntie Meena in Mumbai got a killer deal on a new Samsung phone last week thanks to one! She's usually so careful with her Rs., but even she couldn't resist.", "normalised": "Think of it as a chai break for your wallet. A quick, potent dose of savings before you get back to the grind.

{"unnormalised": "Why do they work so well? Well, a little bit of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) goes a long way. That ticking clock creates a sense of urgency. Plus, retailers often use them to clear out old stock, test the market with new products, or simply drive traffic to their online or physical stores.

Consumers get… well, hopefully, they get a good deal and avoid buyer's remorse! Maybe you can furnish your new 2BHK flat (around 800 sq ft, right?) with some bargains found during a flash sale?
