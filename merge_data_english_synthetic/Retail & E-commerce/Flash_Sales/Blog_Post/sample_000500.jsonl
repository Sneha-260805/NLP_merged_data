{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: it's Diwali shopping frenzy, but condensed into a super-short window. Websites like Myntra and Ajio are masters of this game. They tease you with incredible discounts on everything from Lehengas to kurtas. Dr. Sharma down the street was telling me he managed to snag a new smartphone at almost 50% off during one such sale last month. Now that's a deal worth boasting about!", "normalised": "Think of it like this: it's Diwali shopping frenzy, but condensed into a super-short window.

{"unnormalised": "For retailers, flash sales are a fantastic way to clear out old inventory, boost brand awareness, and drive traffic to their website. Imagine a small boutique in Chandni Chowk holding a flash sale on their winter stock in February. They’d clear out space, maybe around 200 sq ft of it, get some quick cash flow, and get ready for the summer collection.
