{"unnormalised": "Flash sales are everywhere these days, aren’t they? From Myntra to even smaller online stores, they're the retail equivalent of a Bollywood dance number – high energy, fast-paced, and designed to grab your attention. They’re those limited-time offers that promise massive discounts on, well, practically anything. Electronics, clothing, home decor – you name it, some retailer somewhere is probably running a flash sale on it right now.", "normalised": "Flash sales are everywhere these days, aren’t they?

A flash sale could make it finally affordable. You could save Rs. 5000 or more!", "normalised": "But are they worth the hype? Well, that depends. On one hand, you can snag some amazing deals.

{"unnormalised": "So, how do you navigate the flash sale frenzy? First, have a plan. Know what you're looking for and roughly what price you're willing to pay. Second, compare prices elsewhere before you commit. That \"discounted\" price might still be higher than the regular price somewhere else. Finally, don’t panic! If you miss a sale, chances are another one will be along soon. Remember the saree I missed? I'm betting they'll have another flash sale before Diwali. Stay tuned and shop smart, folks!", "normalised": "So, how do you navigate the flash sale frenzy? First, have a plan. Know what you're looking for and roughly what price you're willing to pay.
