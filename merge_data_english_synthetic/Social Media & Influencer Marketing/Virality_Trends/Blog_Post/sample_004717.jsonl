{"unnormalised": "So, what's making waves these days? Let's talk trends. Firstly, short-form video is still king. Think those crazy reels featuring Bollywood songs sped up with some amazing dance steps. Example: Someone's lip-syncing to \"Kajra Re\" with 10 outfit changes – BOOM, instant virality. Remember that trend back in 2021 where everyone was dancing to 'Bachpan ka Pyar'? That was GOLD.", "normalised": "So, what is making waves these days? Let us talk trends.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the influencer game. Collaborations are HUGE. Imagine Bhuvan Bam doing a collab with Prajakta Koli – that's viral potential right there. Brands are also catching on, partnering with smaller, more niche influencers to reach specific audiences. Think a local saree shop in Varanasi working with a fashion blogger – super effective!", "normalised": "Then there is the influencer game. Collaborations are HUGE.

Anything that reminds people of their childhood, like old Doordarshan shows or Amar Chitra Katha comics, is bound to get some love.

The internet has a good sense of humour, but it can smell a fake faster than you can say \"paneer tikka masala\". So experiment, have fun, and who knows, maybe your content will be the next big thing! I'm betting on someone recreating the entire Mahabharata on TikTok by 15/08/2024. That would be EPIC. And one last thing – never forget to include your hashtag strategy, folks. #ViralHogaIndia!", "normalised": "Keep an eye on trending topics, engage with your audience, and most importantly, be authentic!
