Ever scrolled through your Instagram feed and wondered, \"How did *that* go viral?\" We've all been there, seeing some random video of a chaiwala in Chandni Chowk suddenly blowing up.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's trending right now in the virality game? Well, it's not just about being funny anymore (though humor still helps!). Authenticity is HUGE.

And ideally, they should support a good cause or be really, really silly. Think something like #DesiDanceOff or #MomoChallenge (but, you know, a safe version!).", "normalised": "Another big trend?

And most importantly, remember to add that desi touch – a bit of Bollywood drama, some relatable Indian humor, and maybe even a cameo from your Dadi!
