{"unnormalised": "So, what makes something go viral? Honestly, it's a bit of a crapshoot. There's no guaranteed formula, but we can definitely see some patterns. Authenticity is HUGE.

Everyone in Delhi (and honestly, most Indian cities) can relate to that daily struggle! Humor, too.

You need to be able to identify them early, adapt your content quickly, and hop on the bandwagon before it leaves the station. Imagine trying to capitalize on the \"Pawri ho rahi hai\" meme *now*.
