{"unnormalised": "First, **relatability is King (or Queen!)**. Think about those videos showcasing the quintessential 'Mummyji' struggles with technology, or the hilarious situations we face during Diwali shopping in Chandni Chowk. These are instant hits because everyone from Chennai to Chandigarh can see a bit of themselves in them. Content that taps into shared experiences, especially those rooted in Indian culture, has a HUGE advantage. Remember that \"Rasode mein kaun tha?\" craze? Simple, relatable, and BOOM – everywhere!", "normalised": "First, **relatability is King (or Queen!)**.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, **dance challenges and lip-sync battles** still reign supreme. Since TikTok's ban, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have become the battleground. Catchy Bollywood tunes, regional folk songs, and even remixed devotional music (yes, really!) are all fair game. The \"Naatu Naatu\" frenzy after RRR is a prime example. Everyone from your chacha to your dadi was trying out the moves. And speaking of RRR, remember that the movie was released on 25/03/2022? The virality continued for months!", "normalised": "Secondly, **dance challenges and lip-sync battles** still reign supreme.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, **regional content is exploding**. People are hungry to see their own languages, dialects, and cultural nuances represented online. Channels focusing on Telugu comedy, Marathi cooking, or Bengali travel are thriving. Don't underestimate the power of local pride!

{"unnormalised": "And finally, **remember to keep it short and sweet**. Attention spans are dwindling faster than a samosa on a hungry family's plate. Aim for engaging content under 60 seconds, maybe even less. Nobody wants to watch a 5-minute dissertation on why chai is better than coffee (even though we all know it is!).
