{"unnormalised": "Firstly, authenticity is KING. Forget the perfectly curated Instagram feeds. People are vibing with raw, relatable content. Think your everyday Raju from Raipur sharing his quirky dance moves at a family wedding. Or maybe Aunty Sharma’s hilarious takes on current affairs – unfiltered and unapologetic.
