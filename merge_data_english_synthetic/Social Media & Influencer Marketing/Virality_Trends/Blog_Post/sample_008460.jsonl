{"unnormalised": "One trend that's been consistently hot since around 10/10/2023 is hyper-localized content. Forget generic \"travel tips,\" people want to see hidden gems in their own cities.

{"unnormalised": "Another interesting shift is towards authenticity over perfection. Remember those perfectly curated Instagram feeds? Gone are the days! People are craving realness. Think less Aishwarya Rai on the red carpet, more your next-door neighbour showing off her home-cooked biryani – even if it’s a little burnt!

{"unnormalised": "The \"challenges\" trend, reminiscent of the Ice Bucket Challenge of ages past, is still alive, just evolving. Now, instead of large-scale awareness campaigns, we're seeing more brand-specific challenges that encourage user-generated content.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, don't underestimate the power of nostalgia. Throwback Thursday (#TBT) is a classic, but brands are leveraging nostalgia in more creative ways. Think recreating iconic Bollywood scenes or using jingles from classic Indian ads (remember the Lijjat Papad bunny?).
