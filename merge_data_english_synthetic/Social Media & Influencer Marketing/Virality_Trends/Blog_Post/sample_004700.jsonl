Think everyday struggles, hilarious family dramas (especially involving *sasuma* and *bahu*!), and anything that taps into our shared Indian experiences. Remember that \"Rasode Mein Kaun Tha?\" meme? Gold! Pure gold! That exploded back in August 2020 and showed us the power of taking something ordinary (a daily soap opera scene) and turning it into internet legend.", "normalised": "Right now, relatable content is king.

Bollywood has ALWAYS been a HUGE influencer, and if a catchy song drops with a simple hook step, expect everyone from Delhi to Chennai to be busting a move and uploading it on Insta Reels by 3 PM tomorrow!

{"unnormalised": "Another trend I’ve noticed is the regional language takeover. Content creators are now increasingly making content in their mother tongues – be it Marathi, Tamil, or Bengali – and it's resonating massively. We're seeing more influencers from smaller towns and cities gain HUGE followings, speaking directly to their communities. Plus, the influencer game is changing – it’s about authenticity and relatability rather than just a pretty face and expensive clothes. People are looking for genuine connections.", "normalised": "Another trend I’ve noticed is the regional language takeover.

Throwbacks to classic Bollywood tunes, snippets from old Doordarshan shows, or even just reminders of simpler times can spark a serious wave of nostalgia and shares. Think of that old Maruti 800 commercial from back in the 90s. Still gives you the feels, right? The Indian audience has a long cultural memory. Use it! Just don’t copy other’s content! Remember the recent case in which an upcoming creator had to pay a penalty of Rs. 50,000 for using another’s video?
