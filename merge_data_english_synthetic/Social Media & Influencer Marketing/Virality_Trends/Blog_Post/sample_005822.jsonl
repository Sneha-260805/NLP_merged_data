But spotting patterns can give you a serious edge. Think about the \"pawri ho rahi hai\" trend that took India by storm back in February two thousand and twenty one. Yashraj Mukhate's remix turned a simple statement into a national earworm. Why did it work? It was relatable, funny, and easily replicated."}

People's attention spans are shorter than a Delhi auto ride in peak traffic (seriously!). If you’re working with influencers, encourage them to create snackable content. Think quick tutorials, hilarious skits, or engaging challenges."}

Encourage your audience to participate and create content related to your brand. Think of a challenge where people share their best Dosa recipes using a specific brand of batter. This kind of authentic content resonates deeply and can spread like wildfire, especially if incentivized well. Imagine, if you did that in Bangalore right after nine zero zero hours on a Sunday morning, it could break the internet!"}
