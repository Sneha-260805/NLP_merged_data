I feel like what blew up yesterday is completely irrelevant today! like, remember that \"Pawri ho rahi hai\" meme from two thousand and twenty one? total internet sensation, even Amul hopped on! but try launching something similar now - instant flop. what are you guys seeing lately? any surprising hits or misses? I am trying to help my cousin, Priya, with her online saree business. she has got gorgeous Banarasi silk and stunning Kanjivarams, but getting those eyeballs is proving tough. We have tried reels showcasing the intricate zari work (some pieces have over rupee fifty thousand worth!), even a collab with a local influencer from Delhi University, but the engagement is lukewarm. someone suggested focusing on short-form content highlighting the craftsmanship, maybe showcasing artisans working in their workshops in Varanasi. think that will click? We are even considering a contest - maybe a giveaway of a handloom scarf or something. any thoughts on how to target that sweet spot between authentic storytelling and meme-able content? We even checked with doctor Sharma from I I M Ahmedabad for market survey assistance! budget is a concern, so no massive ad campaigns. just trying to leverage organic reach and creative content. this small workshop is only about five hundred square feet. let us brainstorm! What is working for you in this crazy algorithm-driven world? Any new platforms or content formats to watch out for in two thousand and twenty four? help a desi girl out!"}
