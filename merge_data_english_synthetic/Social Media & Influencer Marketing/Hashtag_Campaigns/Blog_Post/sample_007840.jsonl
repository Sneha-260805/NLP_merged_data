{"unnormalised": "A well-executed hashtag campaign is like a perfectly cooked biryani – the right ingredients, the right spices, and just the right amount of *dum* (pressure/focus!). Think of the hashtag as your main ingredient – something catchy, relevant, and easy to remember. Remember Tata Tea’s #JaagoRe campaign? That was a game-changer.

Suddenly, anyone searching for sweets in Lucknow can find them. Plus, they encourage user-generated content. People love sharing their experiences, and a dedicated hashtag gives them a platform. Think about a recent Onam celebration. Using #Onam2024 allows people across Kerala and even outside to share their festivities and see how others are celebrating. It builds community!", "normalised": "Now, why are they important? Well, for starters, they boost brand visibility. Imagine a small bakery in Lucknow using hash Lucknowi Desserts.
