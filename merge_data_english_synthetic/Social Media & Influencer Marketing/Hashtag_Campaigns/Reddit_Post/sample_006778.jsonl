Specifically, what makes them really take off, you know, go viral like \"Why this Kolaveri D I?\" did way back when? I've been playing around with a few for my small business in Mumbai (we sell handcrafted juttis, super comfy!). I tried hash tag Jutti Love and hash tag Mumbai Feet but haven't seen the traction I was hoping for. Are there any killer tips beyond the obvious (keep it short, relatable)? What strategies have worked for you? Did contests or influencer collabs (maybe with someone from Bollywood?) boost your reach? I'm thinking of trying a campaign centered around Diwali – maybe something like hash tag Diwali Feet or hash tag Festival Footwear. Would targeting a specific holiday or event help? Also, any advice on measuring R O I? I'm tracking mentions and engagement, but how do I actually link that to sales? Our shop is small, only about two hundred square feet near Crawford Market, so every rupee counts! I saw a Doctor talking about A I and hash tag analysis. Is that something worth investing in, or is it overkill for a small business like mine? What are some affordable options available in India? I'm really looking for actionable advice here – things I can implement tomorrow. Think local tips, not just textbook definitions! Thanks in advance, and chai on me (virtually, of course!) if your suggestion helps me blow up my campaign!"}
