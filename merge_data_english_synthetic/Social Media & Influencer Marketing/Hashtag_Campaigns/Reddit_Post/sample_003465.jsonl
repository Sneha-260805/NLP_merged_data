{"unnormalised": "Hey fellow marketers!", "normalised": "Hey fellow marketers! Let us talk hash tag campaigns. I have been running a few lately for local businesses here in Mumbai, and some are total duds, others are boom! Like, totally viral. Anyone else having crazy inconsistent results? I am wondering what you all are doing to ensure your hash tag campaigns actually stick and are not just fading into the digital sunset. I tried a hash Shop Local Mumbai campaign last month, and it got okay traction, but nothing earth shattering. We even roped in a couple of micro influencers from colleges like I I T Bombay to promote it. Maybe the problem was the hash tag itself? Too generic? Also, is it better to create your own totally unique hash tag, or jump on a trending one (when relevant, of course)? I am thinking of doing a campaign for a new saree collection and am considering hash Saree Not Sorry (inspired by the movie kinda!). Risky, I know, but could be fun! Any tips from experienced folks? What kind of R O I are you generally seeing from successful hash tag campaigns? Share your success stories (and your horror stories!)! Let us learn together. Thanks in advance!"}
