I've used the Instagram insights (they're okayish), but looking for something more in-depth. Especially, I wanna know about their buying habits and their disposable income (estimating Rs. is enough) Any insights on analysing location data – is it just a general region or can you get a more granular view like by pin code or area (like 2km radius)? Also, are there any platforms that give you insights on the number of followers who might be affiliated with IIT Delhi or DU - I want to run special discounts for students. Any help is appreciated, chai and samosas are on me (virtually, of course!). Auntie's boutique is about 1000 sq ft, so we need to maximize impact.
