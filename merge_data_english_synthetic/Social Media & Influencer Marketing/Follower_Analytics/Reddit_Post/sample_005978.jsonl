We want to target that. But then, the age demographic is all over the place, 18-44 mainly. And the engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) is like, a dismal 1%.

What kind of content REALLY resonates with Indian followers? Are there better analytics tools than the built-in Instagram ones? (I heard Dr. Sharma at IIM Bangalore knows his stuff on this). Should we look at collaborating with a micro-influencer based in Kolkata or Chennai, maybe? Any tips or advice would be much appreciated!
