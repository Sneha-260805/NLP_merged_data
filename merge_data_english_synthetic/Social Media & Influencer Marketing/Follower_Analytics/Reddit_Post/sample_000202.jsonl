Like, understanding that sixty percent of my followers are women aged twenty five to thirty four is cool, but how do I *use* that info to boost my content strategy? I'm pouring time and rupees into creating reels showcasing the latest saree trends and promoting my mom's handmade kurtis (business venture! one hundred square feet workshop in Andheri!), and I need to make sure it's actually reaching the right people. Any recommendations for tools, tips, or even just general guidance? I even considered a course at I I M-A, but the fees are INSANE.
