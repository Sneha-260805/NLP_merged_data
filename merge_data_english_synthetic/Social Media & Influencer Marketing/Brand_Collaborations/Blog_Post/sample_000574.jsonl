{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *are* brand collabs? Simply put, it's when a brand teams up with an influencer (or another brand, for that matter!) to promote a product, service, or cause. Think Myntra working with Bhuvan Bam for a new sale, or maybe a local chai stall, Raju's Chai Point, partnering with a nearby co-working space. The possibilities are endless!", "normalised": "So, what exactly *are* brand collabs?

{"unnormalised": "Why should you even care? Well, if you're an aspiring influencer, it's your bread and butter. For brands, it’s a way to tap into an existing audience and build credibility.

You need to ensure the partnership aligns with your brand's values and target audience. Otherwise, it's just a waste of money and can even backfire.

Or when Patanjali tied up with Big Bazaar for a mega discount on August 20th, that was a win-win! Just like cracking JEE, getting the collab strategy right takes time. Start small, experiment, and don't be afraid to reach out to brands, even if it's just sending them a DM on 09:00 hrs sharp. Good luck! And hey, maybe I'll see you collaborating with Sabyasachi by 2025! You never know.", "normalised": "Remember that cool campaign by Tata Motors around Diwali two thousand and twenty two?
