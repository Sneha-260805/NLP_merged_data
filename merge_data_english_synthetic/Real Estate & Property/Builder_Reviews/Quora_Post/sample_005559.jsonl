{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're looking to buy a flat, maybe in a place like Nashik or Aurangabad, and you're relying on online builder reviews? I understand the anxiety! It's a big investment, after all.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Honestly, builder reviews are a mixed bag. Think of it like this: it's like asking your relatives about the quality of wedding catering at Sharmaji's daughter's wedding on 26/01/2023. You'll get a range of opinions!", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Some reviews are genuine experiences, good and bad. Others might be planted by the builder themselves or, worse, by their competitors! Always be skeptical. Look for patterns. If everyone suddenly started raving about \"XYZ Builders\" on 10/04/2024, around 14:00 hrs, be wary.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Pay special attention to reviews that detail *specific* problems (e.g., \"The promised club house wasn't ready even after 2 years\"). General complaints like \"bad service\" are less helpful.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "For smaller cities, the situation is even trickier. There are fewer reviews overall, and the potential for manipulation is higher.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "I'd recommend doing more than just reading reviews. Visit the site, talk to current residents (ideally unprompted, maybe during their morning walk around 09:00 hrs), and check the builder's past projects. Even talking to a local property lawyer can unearth hidden red flags.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Don't just rely on the online \"Rs. 50,000 booking amount\" ads. Due diligence is key! And remember, *Satyam Shivam Sundaram* – truth, goodness, and beauty – aren't always found in online reviews. Good luck with your search!", "normalised": ""}
