{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Okay, let's talk builder reviews in the context of Indian real estate! We all know how important it is to find a trustworthy builder when investing in your dream home, right? It's not like choosing a chaiwala, you can't just switch if you don't like the taste! Has anyone else found it super hard to get genuine builder reviews though? I mean, the official websites always paint a rosy picture. I'm talking real, unfiltered feedback. Specifically, I'm looking at reviews for builders in the Mumbai and Pune area. My family is considering a property in Lonavala, about one hundred kilometer from Mumbai, and the builder, \"Shanti Developers\", has some mixed reviews online. Some say they're great, others mention delayed possession (like six to eight months!) and extra charges (rupees fifty thousand for amenities?). Has anyone dealt with Shanti Developers? Or maybe you know some reliable websites or forums where I can find honest reviews? I've heard Magicbricks is okay, but I'm skeptical. I remember my dad telling me that back in his day, people relied on word-of-mouth. He got his flat near I I T Delhi based purely on reputation. Nowadays, with so much marketing and \"paid content,\" it's tough to know what's real. Frankly, I'm feeling a bit like Raju in \"Hera Pheri\" – totally clueless and trying to make a smart decision with my hard-earned money! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"}
