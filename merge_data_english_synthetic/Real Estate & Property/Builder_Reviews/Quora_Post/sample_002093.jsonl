I'm really keen on reading some authentic builder reviews before shortlisting anyone. Been burnt before by fancy brochures, if you know what I mean.", "normalised": "So, I'm finally taking the plunge and looking to buy a flat in Mumbai.

{"unnormalised": "Any insights from people who've recently bought properties (say, within the last 2 years) would be especially helpful. Also, what's a reasonable expectation for RERA compliance nowadays? My cousin bought a flat back in 2018 and it was a total mess, with delays pushing possession back by over 18 months! He finally got possession at 14:00 hrs on 10/03/2020 after a lot of struggle.

{"unnormalised": "Also, should I be looking at social media groups? If so, which ones are good for getting genuine reviews and not just marketing spiel? And are there any legal advisors who specialise in real estate deals and can give background checks on builders? I’m thinking of seeing Mr. Sharma, a lawyer my friend recommended; appointment at 11:00 hrs on 15/08/2023. Any suggestions are welcome!
