But before you hand over your hard-earned Rupees, are you checking builder reviews? Seriously, guys, don't skip this step. It's like trusting Raju Rastogi without seeing his engineering degree certificate slash remember three Idiots? You might end up in a sticky situation! Think of builder reviews as your kundali matching for property. You need to know if this is a good match before shaadi (marriage)! Where do you find them? Well, there are platforms like housing dot com and others that have user reviews. Also, ask around! Word of mouth is HUGE, especially in India. Talk to friends, family, colleagues slash has anyone had experience with \"X Y Z Builders\" in, say, Bangalore or Mumbai? What are you looking for in the reviews? On-time delivery is massive. Look for keywords like \"delayed possession\", \"quality issues\", \"hidden charges\", \"poor customer service\". Were the flats as promised? Is the construction actually two kilometer away from the Metro, as claimed, or is it more like five kilometer? Also, remember that a few bad reviews don’t necessarily mean the builder is terrible. But if there's a pattern, especially around quality or transparency, it's a HUGE red flag. Dig deeper! Maybe check if they've been embroiled in any legal cases related to projects in areas like Navi Mumbai. Due diligence, folks! It could save you a lot of headache (and money!) down the line."}
