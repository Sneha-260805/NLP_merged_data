{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, taking the time to research builder reviews can save you a lot of heartache (and potentially a lot of Rs.) down the line. My advice? Start your research early, maybe even before you finalise which area you want to live in. Check reviews, talk to residents, and even visit the project unannounced around 15:00 hrs to observe the actual construction quality. Good luck finding your dream home!
