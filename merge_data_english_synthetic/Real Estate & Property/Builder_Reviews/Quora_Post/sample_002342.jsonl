{"unnormalised": "Also, how far back should I consider reviews? A review from 2018 might not be relevant if the company has changed management since then. Should I only focus on reviews from, say, the past 2 years? I’m visiting the RERA office on 10/11/2024 at 11:00 hrs to check on pending cases too, maybe that’ll give me some clarity. Any advice from those who've gone through this process before would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance! Jai Hind!", "normalised": "Also, how far back should I consider reviews?
