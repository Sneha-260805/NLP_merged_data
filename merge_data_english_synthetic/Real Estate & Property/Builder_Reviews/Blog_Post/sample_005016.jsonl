Check out real estate forums like Indian Real Estate Forum (IREF) too. Look for patterns. Are multiple people complaining about delayed possession? Is there a consistent theme of poor construction quality? Are there issues with hidden costs, like extra charges for parking or club membership?

The model apartment was stunning! But a quick online search revealed numerous reviews complaining about massive delays (over 2 years!) and poor communication from the builder.

Look for specific complaints. \"The tiles in my bathroom cracked within 6 months\" is much more informative than \"Bad quality.\" And remember, a few negative reviews might be disgruntled customers, but a consistent stream of complaints should make you pause and reconsider. Better safe than sorry, right? Especially when it comes to your life savings and the roof over your head. Dr. Sharma would approve! He always said, \"Measure twice, cut once,\" and that applies to property buying too!", "normalised": "Don't be afraid to dig deep.
