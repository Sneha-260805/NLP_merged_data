These reviews, often found on platforms like Housing.com or Magicbricks, offer insights from actual homebuyers – people who’ve already braved the booking process, construction delays (a common headache!), and post-possession issues with builders like Tata Housing or Prestige Group.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: you wouldn't book a doctor without checking their credentials and maybe reading a few reviews, would you?

Well, pay attention to mentions of construction quality (are the walls actually straight?), adherence to promised timelines (did they deliver the flat in 2023 as promised, or is it still under construction in 2024?), and the responsiveness of the builder's customer service. Did they actually address the leaky faucet issue or the cracked tiles in your precious 1200 sq ft apartment?", "normalised": "What should you look for in a good builder review?

Some reviews might be biased (positive or negative), but a consistent pattern of complaints (or praise!) is usually a good indicator. Remember, finding the right builder is like finding the perfect tailor for your wedding sherwani – it requires research, patience, and a keen eye for detail. So, do your homework, read those reviews, and may your dream home in Gurgaon, Chennai, or even a quaint little town, be everything you hoped for! Avoid unnecessary expenses that lead to increased property taxes or Rs. 5000 fines. Get your OC certificate on time. Good luck!
