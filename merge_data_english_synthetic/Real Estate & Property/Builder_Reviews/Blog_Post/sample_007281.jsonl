{"unnormalised": "Why are builder reviews so important? Well, let’s be honest, promises made during sales pitches can often be as fleeting as Delhi winter. Reviews offer genuine insights from people who have actually lived in the builder's projects. Did the promised 1500 sq ft actually *feel* like 1500 sq ft? Did the amenities, like the gym and swimming pool, ever actually materialise, or are they just mythical creatures talked about in hushed tones?", "normalised": "Why are builder reviews so important?

Did Mr. Sharma get his promised covered parking? Did Ms. Kapoor manage to get the plumbing fixed after complaining for 6 months?

So, do your homework, and may your search for the perfect home be filled with joy (and minimal construction delays!). Remember to check ratings from institutions like CREDAI too! Maybe a project 5 km away is rated higher!", "normalised": "Remember, a good builder review can save you from endless headaches, litigation (nobody wants to spend their time in court, especially not over leaky roofs!), and ultimately, help you find that perfect \"sapno ka ghar.\" Doctor Rao in Bangalore learnt this the hard way – now he's making sure everyone knows about his experience with a certain builder (we won't name names!).
