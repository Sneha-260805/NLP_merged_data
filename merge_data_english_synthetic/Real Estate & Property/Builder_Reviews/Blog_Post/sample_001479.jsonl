You’d check reviews, ask around, and maybe even sample the food beforehand. It’s the same with builders. You need to do your homework.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: would you blindly trust a friend of a friend's recommendation when booking a caterer for your sister's wedding? Of course not!

Sites like Housing.com, Magicbricks, and even Google Reviews are packed with testimonials (both good and bad) about various builders operating in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember the power of word-of-mouth. Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues who have recently purchased property. Their firsthand experiences can be invaluable. A neighbour in your area might have purchased from a specific builder recently and might have information. Getting local insights is crucial. Dr. Sharma, for example, might have a lot of insight if he has resided in your locality for a long time. The average flat costing Rs. 75 Lakhs is an investment that necessitates thorough due diligence. Ensure the builder has all necessary permissions from local authorities and the project is following all compliance as per RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority). Also, note the project's distance from vital amenities. \"Is the project 2 km from the nearest hospital?\" are questions worth asking.", "normalised": "Finally, remember the power of word of mouth.
