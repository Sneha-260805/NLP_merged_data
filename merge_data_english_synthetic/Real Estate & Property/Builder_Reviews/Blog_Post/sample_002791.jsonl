{"unnormalised": "Then there's the quality of construction. Are the walls already cracking after just one monsoon? Are the fittings cheap? Are there consistent complaints about leaky roofs and substandard materials?

Remember, buying a home is probably the biggest investment you'll make. Do your homework! Don't be like Raju who bought a flat in a project without proper approvals and is still fighting the builder in court. Learn from his mistakes! Happy house hunting, and may your dreams of owning that perfect home in Mumbai, Delhi, or even that cute little cottage in the Shimla hills come true! Good luck! Maybe book that site visit at 09:00 hrs next Thursday? Just saying.", "normalised": "Finally, check if the builder has the necessary approvals and clearances.
