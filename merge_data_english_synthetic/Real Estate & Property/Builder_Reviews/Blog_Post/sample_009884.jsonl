Well, first things first, check online forums, real estate websites, and even social media groups. Look for reviews specifically mentioning on-time project delivery (did they actually hand over those keys when promised?), quality of construction (are the walls already cracking?), and the builder's responsiveness to customer complaints. Did they fix those leaky pipes after the monsoon?"}

Check if the builder has all the necessary approvals from local authorities like the P M C or B B M P. A builder with a history of legal trouble or deviations from approved plans is a major red flag.
