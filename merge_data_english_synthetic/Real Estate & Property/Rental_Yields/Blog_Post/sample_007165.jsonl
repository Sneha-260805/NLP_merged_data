{"unnormalised": "Keep in mind, there are gross and net rental yields. Gross yield doesn't factor in expenses like property tax, maintenance, society charges (you know, the Diwali decorations fund!), etc. Net yield does. Always look at the net!

That cuts into your yield, friend.", "normalised": "Keep in mind, there are gross and net rental yields.

{"unnormalised": "A good rental yield depends on the location. Properties in prime areas like Colaba, Mumbai or posh areas in Delhi might have lower yields because property prices are sky-high, even though rents are also high. Places further out, like Virar or Panvel, might offer better yields because properties are cheaper, even if the rent isn't as astronomical.", "normalised": "A good rental yield depends on the location.

But ignoring it is like trying to make biryani without rice – you're just not going to get the full flavour! So, do your homework, crunch the numbers, and happy investing!
