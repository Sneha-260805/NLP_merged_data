{"unnormalised": "Calculating it is even simpler. It's roughly (Annual Rental Income / Property Value) x 100. So, if you're renting out your 2BHK in Bandra for Rs. 50,000 per month, and the property is valued at Rs. 1.5 crore, your gross rental yield would be roughly ((Rs. 50,000 * 12) / Rs. 1,50,00,000) * 100 = 4%.", "normalised": "Calculating it is even simpler. It's roughly (Annual Rental Income divided by Property Value) multiplied by one hundred. So, if you're renting out your two B H K in Bandra for rupees fifty thousand per month, and the property is valued at rupees one point five crore, your gross rental yield would be roughly ((rupees fifty thousand multiplied by twelve) divided by rupees one crore fifty lakh) multiplied by one hundred equals four percent."}

{"unnormalised": "Different cities offer different yields. Generally, Tier 1 cities like Mumbai and Delhi might have lower yields (2-4%) due to high property values, while Tier 2/3 cities like Pune or Jaipur might offer slightly higher yields (4-6%).
