{"unnormalised": "Basically, rental yield is the percentage return you get annually from renting out your property, compared to its purchase price. Think of it as the interest rate on your real estate investment. It’s a quick and dirty way to figure out if your property is a good investment, at least from a cash-flow perspective.", "normalised": "Basically, rental yield is the percentage return you get annually from renting out your property, compared to its purchase price.

{"unnormalised": "Calculating it is pretty simple. Let's say you bought a 2BHK in Powai for Rs. 1 Crore. You rent it out for Rs. 30,000 per month. That's Rs. 3,60,000 annually (30,000 x 12). To find the rental yield, you divide the annual rental income by the property value and multiply by 100: (3,60,000 / 1,00,00,000) * 100 = 3.6%. So, your rental yield is 3.6%.", "normalised": "Calculating it is pretty simple. Let's say you bought a two B H K in Powai for rupee one crore. You rent it out for rupee thirty thousand per month. That's rupee three lakh sixty thousand annually (thirty thousand multiplied by twelve). To find the rental yield, you divide the annual rental income by the property value and multiply by one hundred: (three lakh sixty thousand divided by one crore) multiplied by one hundred equals three point six percent. So, your rental yield is three point six percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Generally, a good rental yield in India is considered to be between 3% and 5%. But, like everything else in real estate, it depends! A swanky apartment in South Bombay might have a lower yield because the property prices are sky-high, even though rents are significant. A smaller 1BHK in a developing area like Kalyan might give you a higher yield.", "normalised": "Generally, a good rental yield in India is considered to be between three percent and five percent.

{"unnormalised": "Factors impacting yields include location (naturally!), property type (apartments, villas, commercial spaces), demand, and the overall economic climate. A professor at IIM Ahmedabad once told me that it's also about keeping your expenses down. Repairs, society maintenance (Dr. Sharma's constantly nagging about it!), property taxes – they all eat into your profits.", "normalised": "Factors impacting yields include location (naturally!), property type (apartments, villas, commercial spaces), demand, and the overall economic climate.
