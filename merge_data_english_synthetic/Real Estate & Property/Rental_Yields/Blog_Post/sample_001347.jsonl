{"unnormalised": "What IS a rental yield? Simply put, it's the return on investment you get from renting out your property. Think of it like this: if you bought a samosa for Rs. 10 and sold it for Rs. 12, your yield is 20%. Same principle applies to your property, but instead of samosas, you're dealing with lakhs of rupees and square footage!", "normalised": "What is a rental yield?

{"unnormalised": "The formula is pretty straightforward: (Annual Rental Income / Property Value) x 100. Let's say Priya aunty rents out her 1000 sq ft flat in Powai for Rs. 30,000 a month. That's Rs. 3,60,000 a year. Now, let's say that flat is worth Rs. 1 Crore. Her rental yield is (3,60,000 / 1,00,00,000) x 100 = 3.6%.", "normalised": "The formula is pretty straightforward: (Annual Rental Income divided by Property Value) multiplied by one hundred.

Now, let's say that flat is worth rupee one crore. Her rental yield is (three lakh sixty thousand divided by one crore) multiplied by one hundred = three point six percent."}

If you're paying 8% interest on your home loan, a 3.6% rental yield might not be enough to cover your costs, making you, in essence, a loss making landlord.
