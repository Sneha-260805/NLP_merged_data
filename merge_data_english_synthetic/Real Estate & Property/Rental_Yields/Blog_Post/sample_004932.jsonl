Another real estate jargon bomb?\" Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds, and figuring it out can be the difference between a sweet deal and a sour one.", "normalised": "hey property investors! ever heard seasoned folks like sharma ji down the street talking about rental yields and thought, \"huh? another real estate jargon bomb?\" don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds, and figuring it out can be the difference between a sweet deal and a sour one."}
{"unnormalised": "Basically, rental yield is a simple percentage that tells you how much rent you're earning compared to what you paid for the property. Think of it like this: if you bought a 2 BHK flat in Andheri for Rs. 80 Lakhs and you're renting it out for Rs. 20,000 a month (Rs. 2.4 Lakhs a year), your gross rental yield is (Rs. 2.4 Lakhs / Rs. 80 Lakhs) * 100 = 3%.", "normalised": "basically, rental yield is a simple percentage that tells you how much rent you're earning compared to what you paid for the property. think of it like this: if you bought a two B H K flat in andheri for rupee eighty lakh and you're renting it out for rupee twenty thousand a month (rupee two point four lakh a year), your gross rental yield is (rupee two point four lakh divided by rupee eighty lakh) multiplied by one hundred equals three percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, is 3% good? That depends! It varies based on location, property type (apartments tend to have lower yields than smaller independent houses), and even the market conditions. Dr. Reddy, a renowned real estate analyst from IIM Bangalore, always says, \"Context is king!\" A 3% yield in South Bombay might be decent, while the same in a developing area 20 km outside Pune might be considered low.", "normalised": "now, is three percent good? that depends! it varies based on location, property type (apartments tend to have lower yields than smaller independent houses), and even the market conditions. doctor reddy, a renowned real estate analyst from I I M bangalore, always says, \"context is king!\" a three percent yield in south bombay might be decent, while the same in a developing area twenty kilometer outside pune might be considered low."}
{"unnormalised": "Keep in mind, that's *gross* yield. You also need to factor in costs like property taxes, maintenance (that leaky tap and the occasional whitewash!), and property management fees (if you're using someone like NoBroker). This gives you your *net* rental yield, which is the real number you should be looking at. Don't forget things like society charges either! A building with a swimming pool and clubhouse will have higher charges than a basic building.", "normalised": "keep in mind, that's *gross* yield. you also need to factor in costs like property taxes, maintenance (that leaky tap and the occasional whitewash!), and property management fees (if you're using someone like nobroker). this gives you your *net* rental yield, which is the real number you should be looking at. don't forget things like society charges either! a building with a swimming pool and clubhouse will have higher charges than a basic building."}
{"unnormalised": "For example, that 2BHK flat of 800 sq ft might also have Rs. 5,000/month in society charges & another Rs. 10,000 per year on maintenance.

{"unnormalised": "So, before you invest, do your homework, check the rental yield in the area, and factor in *all* the costs. It might seem like a pain, but it's way better than ending up with a property that's more of a lemon than a gulab jamun!
