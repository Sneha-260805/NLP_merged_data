{"unnormalised": "Basically, rental yield tells you how much moolah you’re actually earning on your investment annually. Think of it as your property's ROI (Return on Investment).

Property taxes, society maintenance, occasional repairs (like fixing that leaky tap Raju bhai couldn't handle), and even property management fees if you're using someone like NoBroker.
