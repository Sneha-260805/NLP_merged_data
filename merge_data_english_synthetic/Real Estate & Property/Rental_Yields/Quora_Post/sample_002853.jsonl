Anything above four percent and Doctor Shah might tell you to double-check the paperwork! Areas further out like Panvel might offer higher yields (maybe five to six percent), but you need to factor in commute to your office (if you’re living elsewhere) and infrastructure."}

Talk to a local broker like Ramesh bhai, who’s been selling property in Dadar for twenty years, before making any decisions. Remember, a higher yield doesn't always mean a better investment. A property with poor maintenance or located in a dodgy area will likely have higher vacancy rates, eating into your profits. Plus, that four hundred square foot flat might become more expensive to maintain over time! Good luck, and happy investing!"}
