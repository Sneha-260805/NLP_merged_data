Simple formula: (Annual Rental Income / Property Value) * 100.", "normalised": "Let's say you bought a two B H K flat in Koramangala for rupees eighty lakh and you're renting it out for rupees twenty five thousand per month. That's an annual rental income of rupees three lakh (twenty five thousand multiplied by twelve). So, your rental yield is (three lakh divided by eighty lakh) asterisk one hundred equals three point seven five percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Let's say you bought a 2BHK flat in Koramangala for Rs. 80 lakhs and you're renting it out for Rs. 25,000 per month. That's an annual rental income of Rs. 3 lakhs (25,000 x 12). So, your rental yield is (3,00,000 / 80,00,000) * 100 = 3.75%.", "normalised": "Is three point seven five percent \"good\"? Well, it depends! Generally, in India, anything between three to five percent is considered decent, especially in metro cities like Mumbai or Delhi. Smaller towns or properties a bit further from the city center might offer higher yields, maybe closer to six to seven percent. You might even be able to find places around Nashik offering better R O I."}

Also, consider the potential for capital appreciation (the increase in the property's value over time). Think of it like this: even if your rental yield isn't huge, you're still building equity, and maybe some day you can treat yourself with a nice plate of Biryani! Good luck!"}
