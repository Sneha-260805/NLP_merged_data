{"unnormalised": "Simply put, rental yield is the annual rental income you get from a property as a percentage of its purchase price (or current market value). Think of it as your return on investment. If you buy a flat for Rs. 50 Lakhs and rent it out for Rs. 12,500/month, your annual rent is Rs. 1.5 Lakhs. Your rental yield is (Rs. 1.5 Lakhs / Rs. 50 Lakhs) * 100 = 3%.", "normalised": "Simply put, rental yield is the annual rental income you get from a property as a percentage of its purchase price or current market value. Think of it as your return on investment. If you buy a flat for rupee fifty lakhs and rent it out for rupee twelve thousand five hundred per month, your annual rent is rupee one point five lakhs. Your rental yield is rupee one point five lakhs divided by rupee fifty lakhs multiplied by one hundred equals three percent."}

{"unnormalised": "Also, location is KEY. A property in a prime area like Connaught Place, Delhi, might fetch a lower yield initially because of the high purchase price, but the potential for appreciation is much higher. Whereas, something on the outskirts, say 50km from the city, might give you a decent yield but slower capital growth.", "normalised": "Also, location is key.
