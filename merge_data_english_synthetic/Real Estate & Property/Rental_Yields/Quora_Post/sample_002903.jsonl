{"unnormalised": "Basically, rental yield is the return on investment you get from renting out a property. It's calculated as (Annual Rental Income / Property Value) * 100.

A higher yield is generally better, but remember that high yield properties might also come with higher risk (think older buildings needing more maintenance or locations with lower occupancy rates). Also, don't forget to factor in expenses like property tax, maintenance (Rs. 5,000 per month for our example flat), and potential vacancy periods.", "normalised": "Is six percent good?
