{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're thinking about investing in property, maybe in Bangalore or Pune, and you're hearing the term \"rental yield\" thrown around. What's the deal?", "normalised": "Basically, rental yield tells you how much money you're making each year from renting out your property, compared to how much you paid for it. It's expressed as a percentage. Think of it like this: if you bought a flat for rupee fifty lakh and rent it out for rupee twenty five thousand per month (rupee three lakh annually), your gross rental yield would be (three lakh divided by fifty lakh) multiplied by one hundred equals six percent."}

Think of it like this: if you bought a flat for Rs. 50 lakhs and rent it out for Rs. 25,000 per month (Rs. 3 lakhs annually), your gross rental yield would be (3,00,000 / 50,00,000) * 100 = 6%.", "normalised": "Now, that's gross. You also need to factor in things like property taxes, maintenance costs (think leaky pipes and that annual paint job), and maybe even management fees if you're using an agency. Once you subtract those, you get your net rental yield."}

What's \"decent\" varies depending on the location, type of property (apartment versus independent house, etcetera) and the current market conditions. During Onam, for example, we see a spike in demand for rentals in Kerala, which can temporarily boost yields."}

A really high yield might mean the property is in a less desirable area, or requires a lot of upkeep. Do your homework! Talk to local real estate agents like my friend Rohan in Mumbai, or check out online resources like Magicbricks."}
