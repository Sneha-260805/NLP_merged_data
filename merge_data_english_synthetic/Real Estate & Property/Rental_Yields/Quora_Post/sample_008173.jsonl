Basically, it's like this: If you buy a flat in, say, Bangalore for Rs. 50 Lakhs and rent it out for Rs. 15,000 a month, your annual rental income is Rs. 1.8 Lakhs (15,000 x 12). Divide that by the property value (50 Lakhs) and you get your gross rental yield – around 3.6% in this case.", "normalised": "Hey everyone! So, you are thinking about investing in property, right? And you have probably heard the term \"rental yield\" thrown around.
