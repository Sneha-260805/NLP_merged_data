{"unnormalised": "Okay guys, let's talk rental yields! It's like trying to find the perfect biryani recipe - everyone has their own opinion!", "normalised": "Basically, rental yield is the annual rental income you get from a property divided by its current market value, expressed as a percentage. So, if you buy a flat in Bandra for rupee one point five crore and rent it out for rupee forty thousand per month, your gross rental yield is roughly forty thousand multiplied by twelve divided by one crore fifty lakh equals three point two percent."}

So, if you buy a flat in Bandra for Rs. 1.5 crore and rent it out for Rs. 40,000 per month, your gross rental yield is roughly (40,000 * 12) / 1,50,00,000 = 3.2%.", "normalised": "Generally, anything above four percent is considered pretty good in cities like Mumbai or Bangalore right now. However, keep in mind that this is a gross yield. You also need to factor in property taxes, maintenance (think leaky taps and annual Diwali cleaning!), and periods when the property is vacant."}

So do your research! Speak to property consultants. Do not just blindly trust that broker uncleji at the corner shop. It depends heavily on location, property type (two B H K versus independent house), and current market conditions. Good luck!"}
