{"unnormalised": "So, how do you calculate it? It's pretty straightforward: (Annual Rental Income / Property Value) x 100. Let's say Dr. Sharma invested Rs. 50 Lakhs in a 1000 sq ft apartment in Bangalore and rents it out for Rs. 15,000 per month. That's an annual rental income of Rs. 1,80,000. The rental yield would be (1,80,000 / 50,00,000) x 100 = 3.6%.", "normalised": "So, how do you calculate it? It is pretty straightforward: (Annual Rental Income divided by Property Value) multiplied by one hundred. Let us say D R. Sharma invested rupee fifty lakhs in a one thousand square foot apartment in Bangalore and rents it out for rupee fifteen thousand per month. That is an annual rental income of rupee one lakh eighty thousand. The rental yield would be (one lakh eighty thousand divided by fifty lakhs) multiplied by one hundred equals three point six percent."}

{"unnormalised": "Generally, a \"good\" rental yield in India is considered to be between 3-5%. But do your research! Talk to local brokers (especially those near IIM Bangalore, they know their stuff), and compare yields in different neighbourhoods before taking the plunge. Knowing your rental yield helps you assess if your property is a solid investment, or if you're better off putting your money in a fixed deposit!
