Think of it like this: if you buy a flat in Bandra for Rs. 1.5 crore and rent it out for Rs. 40,000 per month, your annual rental income is Rs. 4,80,000. The rental yield would then be (4,80,000 / 1,50,00,000) * 100 = 3.2%.", "normalised": "Basically, rental yield is a percentage that tells you how much rental income you can expect from a property compared to its purchase price.
