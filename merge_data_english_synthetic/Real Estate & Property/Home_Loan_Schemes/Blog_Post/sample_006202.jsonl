{"unnormalised": "Then there are **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)** schemes. These are government-backed and specifically target affordable housing for low-income groups.

{"unnormalised": "Remember, read all the fine print before signing anything. Talk to multiple banks. Negotiate. And most importantly, don’t be afraid to ask questions! Getting a home loan is a big decision, so take your time and do your homework. Your *ghar ka sapna* is worth it! And remember that processing fees are usually between 0.5% - 1% of the loan amount, costing you upwards of Rs. 50000 for a significant loan. I once helped my cousin negotiate down the processing fee at 17:00 hrs on 15/08/2023. Good luck!", "normalised": "Remember, read all the fine print before signing anything. Talk to multiple banks.
