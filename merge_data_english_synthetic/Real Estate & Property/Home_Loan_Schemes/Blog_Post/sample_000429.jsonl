{"unnormalised": "Applying for a home loan can be stressful, but it's worth it when you finally get the keys to your own place. Just do your research, compare offers, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Banks are required to provide information in simple terms - like you explaining cricket to your grandma. Get pre-approved for a loan before you start hunting, like I did on 26/01/2020, it gives you a budget and shows sellers you are serious! Good luck, and happy house hunting!
