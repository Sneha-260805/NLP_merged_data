How much is it (usually, it's two to three months' rent), and more importantly, what are the conditions for getting it back? Make sure it's not something ridiculous, like needing to repaint the entire flat if you've only hung up a few posters. Also, check when you can expect to get it back - should be clearly defined, say, within fifteen days after you move out."}

Can you run a small business from home, or are you restricted to residential use only? And what about parking? Do you get a dedicated parking spot, or is it a free-for-all on the street, battling auto-rickshaws for space? Nobody wants to walk one kilometer after a long day at work."}
