You need all the ingredients (clauses) in the right proportions (legally sound) to avoid a recipe disaster (rental disputes). It's basically a contract between you, the tenant, and your landlord, like Mr. Sharma. It spells out everything from how much rent you pay (say, rupee fifteen thousand per month) and when it's due, to the security deposit (maybe rupee forty five thousand), and even stuff like who's responsible for fixing that leaky tap."}
