{"unnormalised": "First off, READ THE WHOLE THING. Don’t just glance at the rent amount (which, let's be real, is probably outrageous anyway). Check the clauses about security deposit – how much? When do you get it back? What deductions are allowed? Make sure it aligns with what you discussed with Uncle Sharma, the landlord. Get everything in writing. Verbal promises are worth less than a Rs. 5 coin these days.", "normalised": "First off, READ THE WHOLE THING.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, get it registered! It’s usually a shared expense between you and the landlord. Registration gives the agreement legal standing, especially helpful if things go south and you need to involve the authorities. Think of it as getting your relationship “official” with the apartment – way less drama in the long run. This registration is often mandatory under state laws for agreements exceeding, say, 11 months.", "normalised": "Finally, get it registered!
