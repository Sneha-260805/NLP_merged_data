{"unnormalised": "What should be in it? EVERYTHING! Rent amount, maintenance charges (super important!), due date (mark it on your calendar!), and the duration of the lease. Typically, it's 11 months, to avoid some registration hassles, but double-check everything. My friend, Priya, learned that the hard way when her landlord tried to increase the rent after only 6 months! Nightmare fuel!", "normalised": "What should be in it? Everything!

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of timeframes, the agreement should clearly state the lock-in period. Many agreements have clauses stating that you can't vacate before, say, 6 months, or you lose your deposit. And ALWAYS note the date the agreement comes into effect!

Once you're both happy, sign it, get it notarized if needed, and keep a copy safe. And for all those signing agreements after 09:00 hrs on 15/08/2024 , good luck!
