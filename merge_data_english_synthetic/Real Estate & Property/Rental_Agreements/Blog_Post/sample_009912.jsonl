First, the basics: who's who (landlord, tenant), property address (obviously!), and the monthly rent. Speaking of rent, make sure it's crystal clear when it's due. Is it the first of every month, or is there a grace period? What about late fees? Get it all in writing."}

So, if your rent is rupee fifteen thousand, expect a deposit of around rupee thirty thousand to rupee forty five thousand. The agreement should clearly state when and how this deposit will be returned. We’re talking within fifteen days of moving out, or some other pre-agreed timeframe."}

Don’t just skim it. If you're unsure about something, ask a lawyer or someone who knows their stuff. Think of it as an investment in your peace of mind. You wouldn't buy a scooter and not read the owner’s manual, would you? It’s the same deal. You don't want to end up walking kilometer to the bus stop because your scooter broke down. Happy renting! And remember, avoid being a Raju!"}
