If something seems unfair or unclear, negotiate with the landlord. Maybe you can negotiate a lower security deposit, or get a clause added about painting the walls a vibrant colour if you promise to repaint them back to beige before moving out on first january two thousand and twenty five (just kidding... mostly!). Also verify the landlord's identity and ownership of the property before handing over any money, especially if the payment is scheduled on an auspicious day like fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four at nine zero zero hours. Getting a lawyer to review the agreement might be a good idea, especially for longer leases or commercial properties near, say, Nariman Point in Mumbai. This will protect you from future headaches. Happy renting, and may your next home be blessed by Lakshmi!"}
