{"unnormalised": "Hey folks! Renting a place in Mumbai or Bangalore can be a real headache, right? Finding a decent flat near your office in, say, Bandra, is tough enough, but then comes the rental agreement…ugh! Most people just gloss over it, sign on the dotted line, and hope for the best. Don't be like Raju Bhai from my building – he didn't read his agreement and ended up paying Rs. 5000 extra every month because of some sneaky clause about maintenance charges!", "normalised": "Hey folks!

It's basically the blueprint of your relationship with your landlord, like Mrs. Sharma who always complains about noise. This doc covers everything from the rent amount (Rs. 20,000 is the going rate for a 1 BHK these days, crazy!), the security deposit (usually 2-3 months rent), and who’s responsible for repairs.", "normalised": "Seriously, take the time to understand your rental agreement.

{"unnormalised": "Important things to check? Lock-in period! Some landlords will try to trap you for 11 months even if you want to shift after 6. Also, make sure it clearly states how much notice you need to give before moving out – typically 30 days. And, crucially, check the clauses about rent increases. Is it fixed, or will it jump by 10% every year like clockwork? Nobody wants a surprise like that, especially not during Diwali!", "normalised": "Important things to check? Lock-in period!

{"unnormalised": "Think of the agreement as your shield against potential disagreements. What if the geyser breaks? Is it the landlord's responsibility or yours?
