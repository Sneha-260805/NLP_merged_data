{"unnormalised": "Trust me, I've seen enough people get royally screwed over because they skimmed over the fine print faster than you can say \"chai\". Think of your rental agreement as your bible for the next, say, 11 months (typical in Mumbai, no?).

{"unnormalised": "Now, don't just blindly sign whatever your landlord throws at you. Read it carefully! Seriously, get a magnifying glass if you need to. Pay attention to clauses about maintenance.

{"unnormalised": "Also, double-check the termination clause. What's the notice period? Usually it’s a month, but sometimes landlords try to sneak in something longer. And what happens if you need to break the agreement early? Will you lose your entire security deposit? Negotiation is key here! Remember that awesome flatmate Rahul who moved to Bangalore last year? He lost a big chunk of his deposit because he didn't give enough notice. Tragedy!", "normalised": "Also, double-check the termination clause. What's the notice period?

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial thing: ensure the agreement clearly states the condition of the property at the time of signing. Any existing damages should be noted down.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, get it registered! In many states, registration is mandatory (especially for longer leases). This gives the agreement legal validity and protects you both, tenant and landlord, in case of any disputes. Plus, you can use the registered agreement as proof of address. Win-win! Remember, signing on the dotted line at 09:00 hrs isn't the end, it's the beginning. Do your homework! You’ll thank me later, especially if the landlord tries any *jhol*. Good luck with your house hunting! Don't forget to bring mithai for the neighbors when you move in, around 17:00 on 26/01/2024! They’ll appreciate it.", "normalised": "And finally, get it registered!
