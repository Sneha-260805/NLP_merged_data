{"unnormalised": "What should you be looking for? First, double-check your name and address are correct. Then, scrutinize the rent payment schedule. Is it the 5th of every month, or the 10th? Late fees can be a real pain! The agreement will also specify the lock-in period, if any. Usually, there's a clause stating you can't leave before 11 months without penalty. Also, make sure it clearly states who's responsible for what. Is Mr. Sharma taking care of plumbing issues, or is that on you?", "normalised": "What should you be looking for?

{"unnormalised": "Finally, get it registered! Especially in cities like Bangalore or Chennai, registration is usually mandatory. It gives the agreement more legal weight. You might have to visit the sub-registrar office around 09:00 hrs with Mr. Sharma, but it’s worth the effort. Happy renting, folks!
