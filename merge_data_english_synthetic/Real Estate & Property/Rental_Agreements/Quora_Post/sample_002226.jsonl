{"unnormalised": "**Quora Post: Rental Agreements**", "normalised": "So, I've been helping my cousin, Priya, find a place to rent in Bangalore, and the whole rental agreement process has been a bit of a rollercoaster. I thought I'd share a few things I've learned, especially for first-timers."}
{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone!", "normalised": "First off, READ EVERYTHING! Don’t just gloss over it thinking “it’s just standard stuff.” Pay close attention to the lock-in period. Priya nearly signed one with a twelve month lock-in, but she plans on going to Mumbai for a job offer in about six months! Dodged a bullet there, thanks to good old fashioned vigilance."}

In Bangalore, it's pretty common to see two to three months' rent as a security deposit. Make sure you understand the terms for getting that back. Check if there are clauses about deductions for normal wear and tear versus actual damage.

Some agreements have hefty penalties. Priya's initial agreement had a clause stating rupees five hundred per day after the fifth of the month. Negotiate if you can."}

When will the agreement expire? (Check the expiry date, say, sometime around eleven hundred hours on thirty first december two thousand and twenty four). What's the process for renewal?
