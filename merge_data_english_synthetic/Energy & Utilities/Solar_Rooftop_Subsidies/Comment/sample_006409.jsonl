{"unnormalised": "Yaar, solar rooftop subsidies are a great idea! Imagine saving money on electricity bills in Chennai heat. My cousin Priya in Bangalore installed one last year, got a subsidy and says her bill is almost zero! Perfect timing before Diwali expenses start piling up.

Anyone know if TEDA provides these subsidies easily?", "normalised": "Friend, solar rooftop subsidies are a great idea! Imagine saving money on electricity bills in Chennai heat.
