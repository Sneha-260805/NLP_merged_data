{"unnormalised": "The rooftop solar subsidy program is crucial for India's energy transition. The MNRE's initiative targeting individual households, particularly in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, is commendable. Perhaps expanding the scope to include cooperative housing societies like those in Mumbai, registered before 26/01/1950, could further accelerate adoption.
