However, simplifying the application process, perhaps through collaboration with institutions like IIT-Madras, is vital. Timely disbursal of subsidies, especially before festivals like Onam, would incentivize uptake.

A 5kW system can significantly reduce electricity bills. More data on subsidy effectiveness per km² would be insightful.", "normalised": "Rooftop solar subsidies are crucial for widespread adoption in India.
