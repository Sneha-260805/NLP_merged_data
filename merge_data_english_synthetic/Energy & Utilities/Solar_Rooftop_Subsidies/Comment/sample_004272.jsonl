{"unnormalised": "The solar rooftop subsidy program is a welcome initiative for promoting renewable energy adoption in India. However, the application process, particularly for residents in smaller towns like Madurai, Tamil Nadu, needs streamlining. Delays and complicated paperwork often deter potential applicants. Perhaps incorporating learnings from schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana could help. A simpler, faster system would encourage more families to consider solar, especially during auspicious times like Onam, when homes are often renovated. The current subsidy amount, while helpful, may need re-evaluation considering rising material costs (Rs. 50,000 per kW).", "normalised": "The solar rooftop subsidy program is a welcome initiative for promoting renewable energy adoption in India.
