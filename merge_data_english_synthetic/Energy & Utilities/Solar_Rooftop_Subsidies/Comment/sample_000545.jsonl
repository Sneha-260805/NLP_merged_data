{"unnormalised": "Regarding solar rooftop subsidies, it's crucial to analyze their impact on widespread adoption, especially in regions like Maharashtra. A detailed cost-benefit analysis, considering factors such as grid stability and long-term maintenance (25 years), is necessary. Are the subsidies genuinely benefiting the end consumer, like Mr. Sharma in Delhi, or primarily benefiting installers? A review of the policy effectiveness since its inception on 01/01/2020 is overdue. Perhaps a tiered subsidy structure, varying by region and consumption levels (e.g., below 500 kWh), would be more equitable. The MNRE needs to present updated data before 31/12/2024.
