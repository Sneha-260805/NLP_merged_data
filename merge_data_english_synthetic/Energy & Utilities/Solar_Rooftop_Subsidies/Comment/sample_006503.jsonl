Initiatives like these can significantly reduce the burden on the grid, especially during peak demand, like those experienced during Diwali. However, transparency in disbursement, particularly in states like Kerala, needs improvement. Perhaps a streamlined process, similar to Aadhar-linked subsidies, could help. The current Rs. 20,000 subsidy for a 3kW system doesn't fully offset the initial investment, and further incentives might be necessary to encourage widespread adoption in middle-class households in cities like Chennai. More awareness campaigns, perhaps linking solar power to reduced electricity bills and enjoying delicious biryani without guilt, would also be beneficial.", "normalised": "The solar rooftop subsidies offered by M N R E are a welcome step towards promoting sustainable energy adoption in India.
