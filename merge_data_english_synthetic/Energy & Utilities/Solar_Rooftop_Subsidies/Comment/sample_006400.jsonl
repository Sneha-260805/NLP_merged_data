{"unnormalised": "Hey folks, rooftop solar with subsidies sounds amazing! My cousin Priya in Bangalore installed it last Diwali and says her electricity bill is practically zero. She even uses the savings to buy extra Onam Sadhya ingredients every year! Heard the MNRE scheme gives a good discount, right? Wondering if it applies in Chennai. Anyone knows about the process for applying? I am planning for it, so please let me know if I am able to save Rs. 5000 per month. Thanks!", "normalised": "Hey folks, rooftop solar with subsidies sounds amazing! My cousin Priya in Bengaluru installed it last Diwali and says her electricity bill is practically zero.
