{"unnormalised": "Regarding the proposed solar rooftop subsidies, a thorough cost-benefit analysis, considering the varied sunlight availability across regions like Rajasthan and Kerala, is crucial. The subsidy scheme should prioritize areas with high energy deficits. Transparency in disbursement, potentially linked to Aadhaar, is essential. Perhaps a scaled approach, factoring in household income and electricity consumption (in kWh), could be implemented. Are incentives available during Diwali or Onam? This would incentivize broader adoption of solar power and promote sustainability across India.", "normalised": "Regarding the proposed solar rooftop subsidies, a thorough cost benefit analysis, considering the varied sunlight availability across regions like Rajasthan and Kerala, is crucial.
