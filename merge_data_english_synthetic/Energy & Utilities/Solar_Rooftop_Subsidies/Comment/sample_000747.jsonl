{"unnormalised": "Regarding solar rooftop subsidies, a comprehensive review is warranted. The current scheme, while beneficial, could be enhanced to ensure equitable access across states like Tamil Nadu and Bihar. Perhaps linking subsidy amounts to system performance metrics, measured in kWh generated annually, would be a valuable addition. This incentivizes quality installations, preventing issues faced by some adopters in Kerala. A national-level awareness campaign, timed around Diwali, could further boost adoption. The cost, maybe Rs. 50,000 per installation initially, might seem high, but long term gains are substantial, especially considering reduced reliance on coal plants located 500 km away.", "normalised": "Regarding solar rooftop subsidies, a comprehensive review is warranted.
