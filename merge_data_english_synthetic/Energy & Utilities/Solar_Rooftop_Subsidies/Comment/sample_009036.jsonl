It's crucial for making solar accessible, especially in places like Chennai where the sun beats down relentlessly. Imagine powering your AC with sunshine during the Chennai heat! My neighbour, Lakshmi aunty, installed it last Diwali after hearing about the scheme. She says her electricity bill is practically zero now, enough to buy extra sweets for Onam. Wondering if more awareness campaigns in smaller towns like Madurai are needed so even folks there can benefit like Lakshmi aunty and enjoy some extra biryani!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, good to see the solar rooftop subsidy topic being discussed!
