{"unnormalised": "Regarding the proposed solar rooftop subsidies, a comprehensive impact assessment is crucial, especially considering regional variations like those between Kerala and Rajasthan. Will the current subsidy structure adequately address the upfront cost burden for middle-class families in cities like Chennai or Kolkata? Perhaps a tiered approach, similar to the PM-KUSUM scheme, focusing on empowering local manufacturers and installers (especially in tier-2 cities like Coimbatore) would yield better results than blanket subsidies. We should also consider incentives tied to energy generated, as it’s done in Gujarat, rather than simply installation. Onam sadhya reminds us of abundance, let these solar initiatives bring energy abundance to every home.", "normalised": "Regarding the proposed solar rooftop subsidies, a comprehensive impact assessment is crucial, especially considering regional variations like those between Kerala and Rajasthan.
