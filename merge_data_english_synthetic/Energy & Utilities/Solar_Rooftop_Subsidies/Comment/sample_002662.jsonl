{"unnormalised": "Regarding solar rooftop subsidies, I believe a comprehensive review is crucial. The current scheme, while beneficial, needs adjustments for equitable access across states like Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Consider increasing subsidies for lower-income households by 20% and streamlining application processes. Perhaps a pilot program in Bengaluru starting 10/11/2024 could test revised procedures. Transparency is key; publishing subsidy disbursement data quarterly (e.g., by 17:00 hrs on 30/06/2025) is vital. The Rs. 10,000 crore outlay warrants careful management, echoing the principles of Pandit Nehru. The MNRE should also factor in varying sunlight hours across India, affecting ROI differently. Let's aim for a 50 GW rooftop solar target by 2030, beginning with assessment reports due by 09:00 hrs on 01/01/2025.", "normalised": "Regarding solar rooftop subsidies, I believe a comprehensive review is crucial.
