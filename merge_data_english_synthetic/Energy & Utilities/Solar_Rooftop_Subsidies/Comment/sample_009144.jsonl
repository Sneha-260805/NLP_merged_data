{"unnormalised": "The solar rooftop subsidies offered by MNRE are a welcome step towards promoting sustainable energy adoption in India. However, streamlining the application process, perhaps with a central portal like the one for Ayushman Bharat, could significantly improve uptake. A family in Kochi could save considerable money each year. Subsidies should also be extended to smaller installations (<3kW). This Diwali, let's illuminate our homes with clean energy, reducing our dependence on thermal power plants. Perhaps incentives for including battery storage could be considered, making solar even more effective, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh, where grid reliability can be a concern.", "normalised": "The solar rooftop subsidies offered by M N R E are a welcome step towards promoting sustainable energy adoption in India.
