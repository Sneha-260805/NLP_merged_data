{"unnormalised": "Mumbai, Maharashtra – The Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) announced revisions to its solar rooftop subsidy program this week, aiming to further incentivize adoption across the state. Dr. Anil Kumar, Director of MEDA, stated the revised scheme increases subsidies for residential installations up to 3kW, providing a significant reduction in upfront costs for homeowners.", "normalised": "mumbai, maharashtra – the maharashtra energy development agency (M E D A) announced revisions to its solar rooftop subsidy program this week, aiming to further incentivize adoption across the state. doctor anil kumar, director of M E D A, stated the revised scheme increases subsidies for residential installations up to three kilowatt, providing a significant reduction in upfront costs for homeowners."}
{"unnormalised": "The program now offers a subsidy of Rs. 15,000 per kW for the first 3kW, capped at Rs. 45,000. For installations between 3kW and 10kW, a reduced subsidy of Rs. 7,500 per kW applies. This move is expected to particularly benefit middle-class families residing in urban areas like Pune and Nagpur, where space constraints often limit ground-mounted solar options.", "normalised": "the program now offers a subsidy of rupee fifteen thousand per kilowatt for the first three kilowatt, capped at rupee forty five thousand. for installations between three kilowatt and ten kilowatt, a reduced subsidy of rupee seven thousand five hundred per kilowatt applies. this move is expected to particularly benefit middle-class families residing in urban areas like pune and nagpur, where space constraints often limit ground-mounted solar options."}
{"unnormalised": "Experts predict the enhanced subsidies will drive demand, leading to more solar rooftop installations on homes and small businesses, potentially adding several MW of renewable energy capacity to the state grid. This will also help in achieving the state's ambitious renewable energy targets as part of the \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative. Many households with rooftops of sizes greater than 500 sq ft stand to gain from this initiative. The scheme is valid until March 31, 2024.", "normalised": "experts predict the enhanced subsidies will drive demand, leading to more solar rooftop installations on homes and small businesses, potentially adding several megawatt of renewable energy capacity to the state grid. this will also help in achieving the state's ambitious renewable energy targets as part of the \"atmanirbhar bharat\" initiative. many households with rooftops of sizes greater than five hundred square feet stand to gain from this initiative. the scheme is valid until march thirty one, two thousand and twenty four."}
