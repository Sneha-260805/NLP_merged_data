A typical 3kW system covers approximately 300 sq ft and can save a household Rs. 30,000 annually. The next phase of the program will focus on integrating rooftop solar with electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Updates to the scheme are available on MEDA's website. Further incentives are also being explored for installations exceeding 10kW.", "normalised": "The initiative aims to add five hundred megawatt of solar rooftop capacity by two thousand and twenty six, furthering the state's commitment to clean energy.
