Installers in states like Rajasthan are reporting brisk business, with many homeowners opting for systems sufficient to power their homes and potentially feed excess electricity back to the grid. For instance, a typical 5 kW system covering approximately 500 sq ft could save a household Rs. 50,000 annually. However, experts advise consumers to carefully vet installers and ensure compliance with all regulatory norms to avail the subsidies.", "normalised": "The current scheme offers subsidies up to forty percent for rooftop systems up to three kilowatt, and twenty percent for systems between three kilowatt and ten kilowatt.
