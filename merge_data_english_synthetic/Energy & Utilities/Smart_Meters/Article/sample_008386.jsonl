{"unnormalised": "So, you’ve probably heard about smart meters. Maybe your neighbour, Sharmaji in Sector 17, got one installed, or you saw something about it on Twitter. Basically, they're the new-age electricity meters that are supposed to make our lives easier and our electricity bills (hopefully) lighter. But are they all that they’re cracked up to be?", "normalised": "so, you've probably heard about smart meters. maybe your neighbor, sharmaji in sector seventeen, got one installed, or you saw something about it on twitter. basically, they're the new-age electricity meters that are supposed to make our lives easier and our electricity bills (hopefully) lighter. but are they all that they're cracked up to be?"}
{"unnormalised": "Think of the old meter wala coming to your house every month, scribbling down numbers, and handing you a bill that always seemed a little… suspect. Smart meters are meant to ditch that whole charade. They automatically record your energy usage – how much electricity you're burning while watching your favorite Bollywood flick (maybe *Sholay* for the 50th time!), running the AC full blast in the Delhi summer, or charging your phone – and send that data directly to the power company, like Tata Power or BSES, without human intervention. No more \"guesstimates\"!", "normalised": "think of the old meter wala coming to your house every month, scribbling down numbers, and handing you a bill that always seemed a little… suspect. smart meters are meant to ditch that whole charade. they automatically record your energy usage – how much electricity you're burning while watching your favorite bollywood flick (maybe *sholay* for the fiftyeth time!), running the A C full blast in the delhi summer, or charging your phone – and send that data directly to the power company, like tata power or B S E S, without human intervention. no more \"guesstimates\"!"}
{"unnormalised": "The big promise is that you get a much more accurate reflection of your energy consumption. You can even get real-time data, often through an app, so you can see exactly when you're using the most electricity and adjust your habits. Maybe you discover your old refrigerator is guzzling power like a thirsty elephant, costing you an extra Rs. 500 a month! Armed with that knowledge, you can make smarter choices.", "normalised": "the big promise is that you get a much more accurate reflection of your energy consumption. you can even get real-time data, often through an app, so you can see exactly when you're using the most electricity and adjust your habits. maybe you discover your old refrigerator is guzzling power like a thirsty elephant, costing you an extra rupee five hundred a month! armed with that knowledge, you can make smarter choices."}
{"unnormalised": "Another plus? Theoretically, smart meters should reduce power theft. Since the data is constantly monitored, it’s harder for someone to tamper with the meter and steal electricity, which benefits everyone in the long run. Plus, remote connection and disconnection allows easier management of consumers' services.", "normalised": "another plus? theoretically, smart meters should reduce power theft. since the data is constantly monitored, it's harder for someone to tamper with the meter and steal electricity, which benefits everyone in the long run. plus, remote connection and disconnection allows easier management of consumers' services."}
{"unnormalised": "But it's not all *laddoos* and roses. There are concerns about data privacy. All that information about your electricity usage is being collected, and some people worry about who has access to it and how it's being used.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the cost. Upgrading to smart meters requires a significant investment, and ultimately, consumers end up footing the bill, often through a slightly increased electricity tariff. We might see a marginal increase of about Rs. 200 - Rs. 300 per month.", "normalised": "then there's the cost. upgrading to smart meters requires a significant investment, and ultimately, consumers end up footing the bill, often through a slightly increased electricity tariff. we might see a marginal increase of about rupee two hundred - rupee three hundred per month."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, there are the occasional glitches. A friend of mine in Bangalore had a smart meter that went haywire and sent her a bill for Rs. 10,000 in one month! It took a while to sort it out. So, while the promise of smart meters is appealing, it’s important to be aware of both the benefits and the potential downsides. It’s a work in progress, but hopefully, in the long run, it will lead to a more efficient and transparent energy system for all of us in India. Maybe even save us a few *rupees*!", "normalised": "finally, there are the occasional glitches. a friend of mine in bangalore had a smart meter that went haywire and sent her a bill for rupee ten thousand in one month! it took a while to sort it out. so, while the promise of smart meters is appealing, it's important to be aware of both the benefits and the potential downsides. it's a work in progress, but hopefully, in the long run, it will lead to a more efficient and transparent energy system for all of us in india. maybe even save us a few *rupees*!"}
