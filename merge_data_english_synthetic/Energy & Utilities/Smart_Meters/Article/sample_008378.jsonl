{"unnormalised": "Basically, a smart meter is like a turbocharged version of your regular electricity meter. Instead of someone from Tata Power coming around every month to squint at dials and guess your consumption (seriously, how accurate *is* that?), the smart meter digitally records how much power you're using and sends that info straight back to the utility company, like BSES in Delhi, via a secure network. Think of it like sending a WhatsApp message about your electricity usage!", "normalised": "Basically, a smart meter is like a turbocharged version of your regular electricity meter.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's in it for you, besides saving the meter reader a trip? For starters, you get *way* more accurate billing. No more inflated bills based on guesstimates. You can also track your electricity consumption in real-time, often through an app or online portal. Ever wondered why your bill shoots up during peak hours? The smart meter will show you exactly when and how much electricity you're using. It's like having your own personal energy auditor!", "normalised": "So, what's in it for you, besides saving the meter reader a trip? For starters, you get *way* more accurate billing.

They're more efficient, more informative, and ultimately, can help us save money and energy. Plus, no more waiting for that meter reader – that's gotta be worth something, eh? With projects handled by companies associated with institutions like IIT Madras to secure energy infrastructure, the future looks promising. Time to embrace the bijli revolution, folks!
