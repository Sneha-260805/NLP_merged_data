One month it's a modest rupee one thousand five hundred, the next it's a whopping rupee three thousand five hundred, even though you haven't suddenly started running a twenty four seven disco at home? Well, say hello to smart meters! These nifty devices are slowly but surely making their way into our homes in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and even smaller towns like Kanpur."}

One month it's a modest Rs. 1500, the next it's a whopping Rs. 3500, even though you haven't suddenly started running a 24/7 disco at home? Well, say hello to smart meters!

Unlike your old, analogue meter that gets read manually – often with a bit of guesswork involved, let's be honest – smart meters communicate your energy usage directly to the utility company in real time. No more meter readers trekking through your building's chaotic parking lot at two p m on a scorching Delhi afternoon!"}

You can see exactly how much energy your fridge is guzzling or if you accidentally left the geyser on all night after that late-night screening of *three Idiots*. (Remember Rancho's energy-saving ideas? Maybe he was onto something!). You can then actually manage your usage and potentially save some serious rupees."}
