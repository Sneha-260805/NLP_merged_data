{"unnormalised": "Basically, instead of the good ol' meter reader Uncle visiting your house every month to squint at that spinning dial, these smart meters automatically send your energy usage directly to the electricity company, like Tata Power or BSES.

By giving you real-time data on how much juice you're using, and when. Think of it like this: you’ll know that leaving your AC on full blast all night while binge-watching Netflix means a bigger dent in your pocket. This awareness is supposed to nudge you towards using energy more wisely. Maybe switch to LED bulbs, use the fan instead of the AC when possible, that kinda thing.", "normalised": "But here is the catch, like that twist ending in *Three Idiots*: They are supposed to help *you* save money too.

{"unnormalised": "However, there are concerns, of course. Privacy is a big one. All that data on your energy consumption – does it mean someone's watching when you cook dinner or watch cricket? Security is another. Can hackers mess with the meters and inflate your bills? Also, what about the upfront cost of installing these things? Will the savings outweigh the initial investment, especially for lower-income families in places like Dharavi?", "normalised": "However, there are concerns, of course. Privacy is a big one.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, whether smart meters are a blessing or a curse depends on implementation and public awareness. If they are deployed fairly, transparently, and securely, they could indeed help us manage our energy consumption better and save some hard-earned Rs. Otherwise, it might just be another techy thing that only benefits the companies, leaving us consumers feeling like *Deewar's* Amitabh Bachchan, empty-handed. The jury's still out, folks.
