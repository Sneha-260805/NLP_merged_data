{"unnormalised": "The primary determinant of LPG prices in India is the international benchmark price of LPG, predominantly based on the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP). This benchmark serves as the base upon which the price for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) – the major public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) – is calculated. Fluctuations in the Saudi CP directly impact the import cost for these OMCs.", "normalised": "The primary determinant of L P G prices in India is the international benchmark price of L P G, predominantly based on the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (C P).

{"unnormalised": "However, the final price that reaches the end consumer is further influenced by several other components. These include: import duties, freight charges from the Middle East to Indian ports like Kandla and Mumbai, handling charges, and marketing and distribution costs incurred by the OMCs. Furthermore, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) levied by the Central and State governments significantly contributes to the retail price. The pricing is usually revised on the 1st and 16th of every month, reflecting changes in the international market. A noteworthy revision occurred on 16/05/2023, where prices saw a marginal decrease.", "normalised": "However, the final price that reaches the end consumer is further influenced by several other components.

{"unnormalised": "Subsidies play a pivotal role in cushioning the impact of market volatility, especially for domestic consumers. The Central government offers a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme called PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantarit Labh) where eligible households receive a subsidy amount directly into their bank accounts. This scheme, while aimed at rationalizing subsidies and curbing diversion, is subject to periodic revisions based on budgetary allocations and socio-economic considerations. Many families in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar rely heavily on these subsidies.", "normalised": "Subsidies play a pivotal role in cushioning the impact of market volatility, especially for domestic consumers.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing mechanism also differentiates between subsidized and non-subsidized LPG cylinders. Households exceeding their quota of subsidized cylinders are required to purchase them at the prevailing market rate, which is significantly higher. The availability of subsidised cylinders has also been impacted by geopolitical factors, especially in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, leading to price increases reported even in smaller towns like Varanasi.", "normalised": "The pricing mechanism also differentiates between subsidized and non-subsidized L P G cylinders.

The proximity of a locality to a major refinery can influence the local price.
