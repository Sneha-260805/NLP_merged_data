{"unnormalised": "The pricing of LPG in India is a multifaceted issue, heavily influenced by international crude oil prices, currency exchange rates (particularly the INR/USD), and government policies. Until recently, the Indian government implemented a subsidy scheme designed to alleviate the financial burden on consumers. This scheme, however, has undergone significant revisions over the years, transitioning from a direct subsidy to a targeted subsidy focused on providing relief to vulnerable sections of society through schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY).", "normalised": "The pricing of L P G in India is a multifaceted issue, heavily influenced by international crude oil prices, currency exchange rates (particularly the I N R slash U S D), and government policies.

{"unnormalised": "Currently, the price you pay for a domestic LPG cylinder is largely determined by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) – primarily Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). These companies factor in the cost of crude oil procurement, refining, transportation, and distribution, alongside applicable taxes and dealer commissions. The OMCs typically revise prices on a monthly basis, usually around the 1st of each month. For instance, a price revision was announced on 01/10/2023, impacting consumers nationwide.", "normalised": "Currently, the price you pay for a domestic L P G cylinder is largely determined by the Oil Marketing Companies (O M C s) – primarily Indian Oil Corporation (I O C L), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (B P C L), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (H P C L).

{"unnormalised": "The subsidy component, if any, is directly credited to the consumer's bank account. This Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, known as PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantarit Labh), aims to eliminate leakages and ensure efficient delivery of subsidies. The effectiveness of this DBT scheme in reaching the intended beneficiaries is often debated, and its impact varies based on income criteria and eligibility.", "normalised": "The subsidy component, if any, is directly credited to the consumer's bank account.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the geographical location plays a role in pricing variations. Transportation costs from refineries to distribution centers add to the final cost, leading to slightly higher prices in remote areas like the North-Eastern states compared to metropolitan cities. For example, the price of a cylinder in Guwahati might be marginally higher than in Mumbai, reflecting the distance and logistical challenges.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the geographical location plays a role in pricing variations.

{"unnormalised": "The future of gas cylinder pricing in India hinges on several factors, including the government's commitment to subsidies, the volatility of international oil markets, and the adoption of alternative energy sources. The push towards Compressed Biogas (CBG) and other renewable energy options is expected to gradually reduce dependence on LPG in the long term. Experts at institutions like TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) predict a gradual shift in the energy mix, contingent on technological advancements and infrastructure development. A stakeholder meeting is scheduled for 09:00 hrs on 20/11/2024 in Delhi to discuss the long-term LPG subsidy policy framework.", "normalised": "The future of gas cylinder pricing in India hinges on several factors, including the government's commitment to subsidies, the volatility of international oil markets, and the adoption of alternative energy sources.
