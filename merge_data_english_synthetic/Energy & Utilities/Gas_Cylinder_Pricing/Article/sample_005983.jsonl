{"unnormalised": "The price of an LPG cylinder, primarily a blend of butane and propane, is influenced by a multitude of factors. Firstly, international crude oil prices play a significant role. As India imports a significant portion of its LPG, fluctuations in global crude oil rates directly impact the cost of importing the raw material. Events like geopolitical instability in the Middle East or changes in OPEC production quotas invariably ripple through to the Indian market.", "normalised": "The price of an L P G cylinder, primarily a blend of butane and propane, is influenced by a multitude of factors.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, government subsidies have historically played a critical role in mitigating the impact of global price volatility on Indian households. The \"Pahal\" scheme, for instance, aimed to directly transfer subsidies to consumers' bank accounts, reducing leakages and ensuring targeted support. However, the extent and nature of these subsidies have varied over time, affecting the final price paid by consumers. On 01/01/2024, there were adjustments to the subsidy scheme that directly impacted the net payable amount.", "normalised": "Secondly, government subsidies have historically played a critical role in mitigating the impact of global price volatility on Indian households.

Moving LPG cylinders from refineries and import terminals to distributors across the country, especially to remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh or the Himalayan regions, involves significant logistical challenges and associated expenses.

{"unnormalised": "State-level taxes and levies also influence the price variability across different regions. Different states apply varying rates of Value Added Tax (VAT) and other local taxes, leading to price discrepancies even within the same country. For example, the price in Delhi might differ from that in Chennai due to these variations. The retail prices often change on the 1st of every month and at 09:00 hrs on the 16th of every month, reflecting adjustments in international crude oil prices and exchange rates.", "normalised": "State-level taxes and levies also influence the price variability across different regions.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of gas cylinder pricing in India is likely to be shaped by several trends. The increasing adoption of alternative energy sources, such as piped natural gas (PNG) and biogas, could potentially reduce reliance on LPG cylinders in urban areas. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, launched on 1st May 2016, aimed to provide LPG connections to women from Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, expanding access to clean cooking fuel.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of gas cylinder pricing in India is likely to be shaped by several trends.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring affordable access to LPG for vulnerable populations, while simultaneously promoting fiscal responsibility and minimizing environmental impact, requires a delicate balancing act. Regular review of pricing mechanisms, coupled with investment in efficient distribution infrastructure, is essential to ensure that the humble gas cylinder continues to fuel Indian homes without placing an undue burden on the common man. The debate regarding a fully market-linked pricing model continues, with arguments highlighting both potential benefits and risks for the vast Indian populace.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
