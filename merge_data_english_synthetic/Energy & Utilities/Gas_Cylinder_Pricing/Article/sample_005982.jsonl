{"unnormalised": "Gas cylinders, a staple in millions of Indian households and commercial establishments, particularly for cooking purposes, represent a significant monthly expense. The pricing mechanism governing these cylinders, primarily Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), is complex and subject to fluctuations influenced by global market dynamics, government policies, and supply chain efficiencies.

{"unnormalised": "The price of domestic LPG cylinders, predominantly the 14.2 kg variant, is determined by a combination of factors. Firstly, international crude oil prices play a crucial role. As India imports a significant portion of its LPG, global benchmarks like Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP) directly influence the cost of raw material. Secondly, the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (Rs.) and the US Dollar (USD) significantly impacts the landed cost of imported LPG. A weakening Rupee invariably leads to higher prices for Indian consumers.", "normalised": "The price of domestic L P G cylinders, predominantly the fourteen point two kilogram variant, is determined by a combination of factors. Firstly, international crude oil prices play a crucial role. As India imports a significant portion of its L P G, global benchmarks like Saudi Aramco Contract Price (C P) directly influence the cost of raw material. Secondly, the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (rupees) and the U S Dollar (U S D) significantly impacts the landed cost of imported L P G. A weakening Rupee invariably leads to higher prices for Indian consumers."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the Government of India implements subsidies on domestic LPG cylinders to cushion the impact of international price volatility on households, particularly those belonging to lower-income groups. The extent of this subsidy, often revised based on budgetary allocations and socio-economic considerations, directly affects the final price paid by consumers. These subsidies are primarily targeted through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which aims to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Government of India implements subsidies on domestic L P G cylinders to cushion the impact of international price volatility on households, particularly those belonging to lower-income groups.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing structure also incorporates factors such as transportation costs from refineries to bottling plants and then to distributors. These transportation costs can vary significantly based on geographical location and infrastructure availability. For instance, transporting cylinders to remote areas in the Northeast like Arunachal Pradesh can incur significantly higher costs compared to distribution within urban centers like Mumbai or Delhi.", "normalised": "The pricing structure also incorporates factors such as transportation costs from refineries to bottling plants and then to distributors.

{"unnormalised": "Consumers across India witnessed significant price hikes in LPG cylinders throughout 2022 and early 2023, fueled by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent disruptions in global energy markets. On 01/01/2023, a significant price increase was implemented, impacting household budgets nationwide. As of 15/07/2024, the price of a 14.2 kg domestic cylinder hovers around Rs. 1100 in many cities, though variations exist. Commercial cylinders, typically 19 kg, are priced higher and follow a slightly different pricing model, less influenced by direct subsidies.", "normalised": "Consumers across India witnessed significant price hikes in L P G cylinders throughout two thousand and twenty two and early two thousand and twenty three, fueled by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent disruptions in global energy markets.

As of the fifteenth of July, two thousand and twenty four, the price of a fourteen point two kilogram domestic cylinder hovers around rupees one thousand one hundred in many cities, though variations exist. Commercial cylinders, typically nineteen kilogram, are priced higher and follow a slightly different pricing model, less influenced by direct subsidies."}
{"unnormalised": "Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the leading public sector oil marketing companies, periodically revise cylinder prices, usually around the 1st and 15th of each month, reflecting the latest global market trends and government policies. Consumers can access updated pricing information through the company websites and distribution networks. A press conference was scheduled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas at 11:00 hrs on 26/01/2024 to announce potential subsidy revisions. Understanding these complex factors is crucial for Indian consumers to navigate the fluctuating landscape of gas cylinder pricing. Consumers are also advised to explore alternative energy sources and adopt energy-efficient cooking practices to mitigate the impact of these price variations on their household expenses.", "normalised": "Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (B P C L), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (I O C L), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (H P C L), the leading public sector oil marketing companies, periodically revise cylinder prices, usually around the first and fifteenth of each month, reflecting the latest global market trends and government policies.
