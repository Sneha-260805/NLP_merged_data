{"unnormalised": "Historically, LPG pricing in India was heavily subsidized by the government. This meant that the actual cost of the cylinder was far higher than what the consumer paid, with the government absorbing the difference. However, in recent years, there's been a gradual shift towards a market-linked pricing model, albeit with some governmental intervention. This transition aims to reduce the fiscal burden on the exchequer and promote a more efficient allocation of resources.", "normalised": "Historically, L P G pricing in India was heavily subsidized by the government.

{"unnormalised": "The base price of an LPG cylinder is largely determined by international crude oil prices. India imports a significant portion of its LPG requirements, making it susceptible to fluctuations in the global energy market. Supply disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and changes in global demand can all significantly impact the cost of imported LPG. For example, the price of crude oil witnessed a sharp rise following the conflict in Ukraine, directly translating to higher LPG prices in India. This was particularly noticeable around March 2022.", "normalised": "The base price of an L P G cylinder is largely determined by international crude oil prices.

These include freight charges, import duties, marketing costs incurred by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), and dealer commissions. State-level taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT), also contribute to the final price paid by the consumer.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the pricing structure includes various components beyond the base price.

{"unnormalised": "The government continues to offer subsidies on LPG cylinders to eligible households, primarily through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). This ensures that the subsidy amount is directly credited to the consumer's bank account, promoting transparency and reducing leakages. The subsidy amount is subject to periodic revisions based on government policies and prevailing market conditions. Announcements regarding subsidy changes are often made around important dates like Diwali.", "normalised": "The government continues to offer subsidies on L P G cylinders to eligible households, primarily through Direct Benefit Transfer (D B T).

{"unnormalised": "The role of institutions like the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) is critical in monitoring and analyzing the trends in the petroleum sector, including LPG. Their insights are instrumental in informing government policy decisions related to pricing and subsidy schemes. It is also important for consumers in Tier 2 cities like Lucknow and Jaipur to understand that prices may vary slightly due to transportation costs. As of 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, analysts at IIM Ahmedabad were predicting a possible minor increase due to upcoming revisions.", "normalised": "The role of institutions like the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (P P A C) is critical in monitoring and analyzing the trends in the petroleum sector, including L P G.
