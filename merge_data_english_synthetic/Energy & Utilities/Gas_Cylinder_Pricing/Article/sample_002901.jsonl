{"unnormalised": "Hey folks! Feeling the pinch every time that gas cylinder needs refilling? You're not alone! In India, the price of LPG cylinders (that's Liquified Petroleum Gas, for the uninitiated) is a topic hotter than a tawa fresh paratha. It’s a constant source of household budgeting headaches, and honestly, trying to understand the pricing mechanism is like navigating the streets of Chandni Chowk during rush hour – utterly confusing!", "normalised": "Hey folks!

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the deal? Why does the price seem to fluctuate more than a Mumbai auto rickshaw’s meter? Well, a big chunk of it boils down to global crude oil prices. Since LPG is a byproduct of crude oil refining, when crude prices rise internationally, so does the price of LPG. Think of it like this: if the cost of wheat goes up, your roti is going to cost more, right? Same principle!", "normalised": "So, what is the deal?

{"unnormalised": "But it’s not just crude oil. The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), along with other public sector oil companies like Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, also play a significant role. They purchase LPG, factor in transportation costs (getting those cylinders from refineries to your local Indane gas agency in say, Kanpur, isn’t free!), and then add taxes and subsidies. Yep, subsidies!", "normalised": "But it is not just crude oil.

{"unnormalised": "The government claims that the fluctuating prices reflect market realities and aim to reduce the burden on the exchequer. They even introduced Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes to supposedly make the process more transparent. But for many households, especially those in rural areas like Bihar or Jharkhand, these price hikes can significantly impact their monthly budgets. It’s a real struggle, as even a Rs. 50 increase can mean cutting back on other essentials.", "normalised": "The government claims that the fluctuating prices reflect market realities and aim to reduce the burden on the exchequer.
