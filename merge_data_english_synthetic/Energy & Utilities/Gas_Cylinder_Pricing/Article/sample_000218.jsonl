{"unnormalised": "The primary determinant of LPG cylinder prices is the international crude oil market. India imports a significant portion of its crude oil requirements, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations. When international crude prices rise, the cost of importing and processing crude also increases, leading to a corresponding hike in the price of LPG. This impact is generally felt with a lag, as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the major players in the domestic LPG market, adjust prices periodically.", "normalised": "The primary determinant of L P G cylinder prices is the international crude oil market.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, government policies play a crucial role. Subsidies, designed to make LPG more affordable for vulnerable populations, directly influence the final price paid by consumers. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), launched in 2016, aimed to provide LPG connections to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, significantly increasing the demand for subsidized cylinders. Changes in subsidy structures, such as direct benefit transfers (DBT) where subsidies are deposited directly into consumers' bank accounts, also impact the perceived cost. The DBT scheme was further refined on 26/01/2015.", "normalised": "Furthermore, government policies play a crucial role.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation costs also contribute to the final price. Distributing LPG cylinders across India, with its vast and diverse geography, involves significant logistical challenges. The cost of transporting cylinders from refineries and bottling plants to distributors and ultimately to consumers, especially in remote areas like the Northeast or high-altitude regions, adds to the overall expense. A strike by truck drivers on 10/10/2023, for example, caused temporary shortages and localized price increases in several states.", "normalised": "Transportation costs also contribute to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "The tax regime, including central excise duty and state-level Value Added Tax (VAT), also influences the final price. Variations in VAT rates across states contribute to price differences observed in different regions of India. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council meets periodically, often at 11:00 hrs, to review and potentially revise tax rates, which could indirectly affect LPG pricing.", "normalised": "The tax regime, including central excise duty and state-level Value Added Tax (V A T), also influences the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Recently, there have been discussions regarding moving towards market-linked pricing for LPG, gradually reducing subsidies. This approach aims to align domestic prices more closely with international rates, potentially reducing the government's financial burden but also exposing consumers to greater price volatility. In Delhi, a 14.2 kg domestic LPG cylinder currently costs approximately Rs. 900, a figure that has seen multiple revisions in the past year. Understanding these complexities is crucial for both policymakers and consumers navigating the fluctuating flames of gas cylinder pricing in India.", "normalised": "Recently, there have been discussions regarding moving towards market-linked pricing for L P G, gradually reducing subsidies.
