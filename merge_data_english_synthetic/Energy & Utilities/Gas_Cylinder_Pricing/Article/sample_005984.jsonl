{"unnormalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in India is a subject of constant scrutiny and concern, directly impacting household budgets across the nation. The cost of a standard 14.2 kg LPG cylinder, primarily used for cooking, is a complex interplay of international crude oil prices, government subsidies, taxes, and transportation costs. Understanding these factors is crucial for informed consumer decision-making.", "normalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders in India is a subject of constant scrutiny and concern, directly impacting household budgets across the nation.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, the Indian government heavily subsidized LPG to make it affordable, particularly for lower-income households. This subsidy mechanism has evolved over time, with direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes like PAHAL aiming to streamline the process. Under PAHAL, consumers pay the market price upfront and subsequently receive the subsidy amount directly into their bank accounts. This system aims to eliminate leakages and ensure that the benefit reaches the intended beneficiaries.", "normalised": "Historically, the Indian government heavily subsidized L P G to make it affordable, particularly for lower-income households.

{"unnormalised": "The fluctuations in global crude oil prices significantly influence the pricing of LPG in India. As a major importer of crude oil, India is vulnerable to price volatility in the international market. For instance, a sharp increase in global crude prices, as witnessed in late 2022 due to geopolitical tensions, directly translated into higher LPG cylinder prices for Indian consumers. This impact is often amplified by the prevailing exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar.", "normalised": "The fluctuations in global crude oil prices significantly influence the pricing of L P G in India.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, state-level taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) also contribute to price variations across different states in India. Consumers in states with higher VAT rates generally pay more for LPG cylinders.
