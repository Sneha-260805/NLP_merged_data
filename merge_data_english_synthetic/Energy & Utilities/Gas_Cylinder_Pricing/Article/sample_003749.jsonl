{"unnormalised": "The base price is largely determined by international crude oil prices, given India's heavy reliance on imports. Fluctuations in the global market directly impact the cost of LPG procurement for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the primary distributors. These public sector undertakings (PSUs) then factor in refining costs and transportation expenses to arrive at a pre-subsidy price.", "normalised": "The base price is largely determined by international crude oil prices, given India's heavy reliance on imports.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, the Indian government has provided substantial subsidies on LPG cylinders to make them affordable for the masses, especially under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aiming to provide clean cooking fuel to below-poverty-line (BPL) families. These subsidies, however, have seen revisions over time, impacting the final price paid by consumers. For instance, on 22/07/2023, there was a readjustment in subsidy amounts for Ujjwala beneficiaries. The exact subsidy amount can vary depending on government policies and budgetary allocations.", "normalised": "Historically, the Indian government has provided substantial subsidies on LPG cylinders to make them affordable for the masses, especially under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aiming to provide clean cooking fuel to below-poverty-line (B P L) families.

{"unnormalised": "Taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), also contribute to the final price. These taxes are levied by both the central and state governments, adding another layer to the pricing structure. Furthermore, distribution charges, which cover the cost of transporting cylinders from bottling plants to distributors and then to individual homes, contribute to the overall cost. In remote areas like the Northeast, transportation costs can be significantly higher, resulting in increased cylinder prices.", "normalised": "Taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (G S T), also contribute to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "The price of a 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi, for example, might differ significantly from the price in Chennai due to varying state taxes and distribution costs. Consumers often rely on updates from sources like PTI or websites of oil companies to stay informed about price revisions, which typically occur on the 1st of every month, around 09:00 hrs. However, mid-month price changes are also possible depending on market volatility.", "normalised": "The price of a fourteen point two kilogram cylinder in Delhi, for example, might differ significantly from the price in Chennai due to varying state taxes and distribution costs.

{"unnormalised": "The government also monitors instances of black marketing and hoarding, especially during periods of high demand or supply disruptions, such as those experienced in the aftermath of Cyclone Biparjoy on 15/06/2023, which temporarily impacted distribution networks in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Strict regulations and enforcement are crucial to ensure fair pricing and availability of gas cylinders across the country. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas plays a pivotal role in formulating policies and regulating the sector.", "normalised": "The government also monitors instances of black marketing and hoarding, especially during periods of high demand or supply disruptions, such as those experienced in the aftermath of Cyclone Biparjoy on fifteenth june two thousand and twenty three, which temporarily impacted distribution networks in Gujarat and Rajasthan.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding these factors empowers consumers to make informed decisions and advocate for fair pricing practices. Future trends in gas cylinder pricing will likely be shaped by the government's commitment to subsidies, advancements in domestic LPG production, and the continued volatility of the global energy market. It's essential to note that fluctuations can occur unexpectedly, such as an unscheduled price revision announced at 17:00 hrs on 10/01/2024, highlighting the dynamic nature of this market. The common man, like Mr. Sharma from Lucknow, is often seen discussing these price hikes and their impact on household budgets.", "normalised": "Understanding these factors empowers consumers to make informed decisions and advocate for fair pricing practices.
