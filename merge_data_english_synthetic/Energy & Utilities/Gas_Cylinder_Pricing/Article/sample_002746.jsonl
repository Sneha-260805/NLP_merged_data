Think of it like the convoluted plot of a Karan Johar film - lots of twists and turns! There's the base price determined by global crude oil prices. If crude goes up, guess what? Your gas cylinder price follows suit. Then comes the transportation cost – getting that cylinder from the refinery to your distributor adds to the expense.
