{"unnormalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, a staple in Indian households from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is a sensitive subject impacting millions. Understanding the intricacies of its pricing mechanism is crucial for both consumers and policymakers alike. The cost of these cylinders, primarily used for cooking, is not a static figure but is subject to fluctuations influenced by a confluence of factors, both domestic and international.", "normalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders, a staple in Indian households from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is a sensitive subject impacting millions.

{"unnormalised": "Primarily, the price of LPG in India is determined by global crude oil prices. As India imports a significant portion of its crude oil, the international benchmark prices, often denominated in US dollars, directly impact the cost of LPG production and subsequent retail pricing. This impact is further amplified by the prevailing exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (Rs.) and the US Dollar. A weaker Rupee against the Dollar translates to higher import costs, pushing up the price of gas cylinders.", "normalised": "Primarily, the price of L P G in India is determined by global crude oil prices. As India imports a significant portion of its crude oil, the international benchmark prices, often denominated in U S dollars, directly impact the cost of L P G production and subsequent retail pricing. This impact is further amplified by the prevailing exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (rupees) and the U S Dollar. A weaker Rupee against the Dollar translates to higher import costs, pushing up the price of gas cylinders."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, government subsidies play a significant role. Historically, the Indian government has provided subsidies on LPG cylinders to make them affordable for vulnerable sections of the population. The subsidy amount is often adjusted based on the fiscal budget and the prevailing political climate. These subsidies are either provided directly to consumers’ bank accounts or indirectly through reduced retail prices. The Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme, also known as PAHAL, aims to streamline this process and prevent leakages.", "normalised": "Furthermore, government subsidies play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "The transportation and distribution network also add to the final cost. Moving LPG cylinders from refineries to bottling plants, and then to distributors across the country, involves significant logistical expenses. Distances, especially in geographically challenging terrains like the Himalayan region, contribute to these costs. For example, transporting cylinders to Leh after 09:00 hrs on 15/08/1947 (a symbolic date) involves significantly higher transportation costs than, say, transporting them within Delhi. The infrastructure challenges, including the condition of roads and the availability of efficient transport systems, are key determinants.", "normalised": "The transportation and distribution network also add to the final cost.

{"unnormalised": "Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) play a vital role in determining the retail selling price. These companies consider the input costs, transportation expenses, and government policies while arriving at the final price. The prices are typically revised on a monthly basis, often around the 1st of the month, reflecting the changing global and domestic market conditions.", "normalised": "Oil Marketing Companies (O M C S) like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (I O C L), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (B P C L), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (H P C L) play a vital role in determining the retail selling price.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of gas cylinder prices is felt most acutely by low-income households. An increase of even Rs. 50 per cylinder can significantly impact their monthly budget. Therefore, the government often intervenes to cushion the blow, particularly during periods of high global crude oil prices. The debate around optimal subsidy levels, balancing affordability with fiscal prudence, remains a contentious one.", "normalised": "The impact of gas cylinder prices is felt most acutely by low-income households.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, a shift towards alternative energy sources like biogas and solar cooking can reduce the reliance on LPG and mitigate the impact of volatile global prices. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aiming to provide LPG connections to below poverty line (BPL) families, have expanded access to clean cooking fuel, but the affordability remains a concern. Continued efforts to improve energy efficiency, promote sustainable alternatives, and streamline the pricing mechanism are essential to ensure energy security and affordability for all Indians, especially considering the fluctuating prices since 01/01/2020 and the recent announcements at 14:00 hrs on 26/01/2024 regarding fuel subsidies. The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) plays a crucial role in advising the government on these matters, providing data-driven insights to inform policy decisions.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, a shift towards alternative energy sources like biogas and solar cooking can reduce the reliance on L P G and mitigate the impact of volatile global prices.
