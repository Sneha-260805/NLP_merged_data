{"unnormalised": "At the heart of the pricing mechanism lies the global crude oil market. India imports a significant portion of its crude oil requirements, making domestic LPG prices vulnerable to fluctuations in international crude oil prices, usually benchmarked to Brent Crude. When global prices rise, the cost of importing LPG also increases, impacting the price consumers pay in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.", "normalised": "At the heart of the pricing mechanism lies the global crude oil market.

{"unnormalised": "The role of government subsidies is another vital component. For many years, the Indian government has provided subsidies on LPG cylinders to make them affordable, particularly for lower-income households covered under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). These subsidies are typically credited directly to the consumer's bank account through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), effectively reducing the cost per cylinder. The level of subsidy is subject to periodic revisions based on budgetary allocations and the prevailing economic climate. For instance, the subsidy policy was significantly altered on 01/01/2015 to adopt the DBT scheme.", "normalised": "The role of government subsidies is another vital component.

{"unnormalised": "The Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), play a critical role in determining the final retail price. These companies factor in the cost of crude oil, refining, transportation, bottling, distribution, and marketing expenses. State-level taxes, like Value Added Tax (VAT), also contribute to the final cost. Different states may levy different VAT rates, leading to regional variations in LPG prices. A price revision usually occurs around 00:00 hrs on the 1st of every month.", "normalised": "The Oil Marketing Companies (O M C S), such as Indian Oil Corporation (I O C L), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (B P C L), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (H P C L), play a critical role in determining the final retail price.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, transportation costs are a significant factor, especially in remote areas like the Himalayan regions or the Northeast. Transporting LPG cylinders across long distances or difficult terrains increases the overall cost, which is ultimately borne by the consumer. In Jammu & Kashmir, for example, logistical challenges often lead to higher prices compared to mainland India.", "normalised": "Furthermore, transportation costs are a significant factor, especially in remote areas like the Himalayan regions or the Northeast.

{"unnormalised": "Recent years have witnessed increasing discussions around phasing out subsidies and moving towards a market-determined pricing system. While this could potentially expose consumers to price volatility, proponents argue it would promote greater efficiency and discourage misuse of subsidized cylinders. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas held a key meeting on 15/08/2020 to discuss future subsidy models.", "normalised": "Recent years have witnessed increasing discussions around phasing out subsidies and moving towards a market-determined pricing system.

{"unnormalised": "The price of a 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi, for example, might be Rs. 900 one month and fluctuate to Rs. 950 the next, depending on the factors mentioned above.
