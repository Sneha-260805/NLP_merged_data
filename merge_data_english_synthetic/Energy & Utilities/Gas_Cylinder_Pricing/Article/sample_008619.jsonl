{"unnormalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, primarily used for cooking, is determined by a combination of international crude oil prices, government subsidies, taxes, and distribution costs. Historically, the Indian government heavily subsidized LPG to make it affordable, particularly for lower-income families. This subsidy mechanism, however, has undergone significant changes over the years. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, like the PAHAL scheme introduced in 2015, aimed to streamline the process by transferring the subsidy amount directly to the consumer's bank account after they purchase the cylinder at the market price.", "normalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders, primarily used for cooking, is determined by a combination of international crude oil prices, government subsidies, taxes, and distribution costs.

{"unnormalised": "The \"market price\" itself is subject to fluctuations based on global crude oil prices, which are quoted in US dollars. A weaker Indian Rupee against the dollar further exacerbates the price burden on consumers. Transportation costs from refineries to bottling plants and then to distributors across the country also contribute significantly to the final price. Furthermore, Value Added Tax (VAT) levied by individual states adds to the regional variations in LPG cylinder prices. For instance, the price in Mumbai may differ considerably from that in Patna.", "normalised": "The \"market price\" itself is subject to fluctuations based on global crude oil prices, which are quoted in U S dollars.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of these fluctuating prices is felt acutely by families like the Sharmas in Delhi, who meticulously budget their household expenses. Mrs. Sharma, a homemaker, notes that the rising cost of LPG has forced them to curtail other essential expenditures. Similar concerns are echoed across the country, especially by those living in rural areas where alternative cooking fuels may be limited or unavailable. A survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) on 01/01/2023 highlighted the disproportionate impact of rising fuel prices on vulnerable sections of society.", "normalised": "The impact of these fluctuating prices is felt acutely by families like the Sharmas in Delhi, who meticulously budget their household expenses.

{"unnormalised": "The government's policy towards LPG pricing has been a subject of constant debate. While proponents of subsidy reduction argue that it reduces the fiscal burden and promotes efficiency, critics contend that it increases the economic hardship for millions of families. The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, plays a crucial role in analyzing market trends and advising the government on pricing policies. Meetings are frequently held at 11:00 hrs to discuss price revisions and their potential impact. The latest revision, announced on 30/06/2024, saw an increase of Rs. 50 per cylinder.", "normalised": "The government's policy towards L P G pricing has been a subject of constant debate.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the transition towards cleaner cooking fuels and alternative energy sources, such as biogas and solar cookers, may offer a long-term solution to mitigate the impact of fluctuating LPG prices. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aimed at providing LPG connections to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, are a step in the right direction. However, ensuring the sustained affordability of LPG remains a critical challenge for the government and a crucial concern for the Indian populace. The next policy review is scheduled for 15/08/2024, and all eyes will be on whether further revisions are in store.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the transition towards cleaner cooking fuels and alternative energy sources, such as biogas and solar cookers, may offer a long-term solution to mitigate the impact of fluctuating L P G prices.
