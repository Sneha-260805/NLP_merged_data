{"unnormalised": "The price of a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder, a ubiquitous feature in Indian kitchens from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is a subject of constant scrutiny and public interest. Understanding the complex factors influencing its cost is crucial for both consumers and policymakers. The price of LPG in India is not a fixed entity, but rather a fluid value dictated by a confluence of global and domestic factors.", "normalised": "The price of a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder, a ubiquitous feature in Indian kitchens from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is a subject of constant scrutiny and public interest.

{"unnormalised": "One of the primary drivers is the international crude oil price. Since India imports a significant portion of its LPG requirement, fluctuations in global crude oil markets directly impact the import cost. The benchmark price for LPG is often linked to the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP), and changes in this benchmark are typically reflected in the Indian retail prices.", "normalised": "One of the primary drivers is the international crude oil price.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the international market, domestic policies play a pivotal role. The government’s subsidy policy on LPG is a significant determinant of the final price paid by consumers. Subsidies are aimed at making LPG accessible to lower-income households, particularly through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which has significantly expanded LPG penetration in rural areas. However, the subsidy structure itself is subject to periodic revisions, influenced by fiscal constraints and evolving energy priorities. The Union Budget presented on 01/02/2023, for instance, outlined changes to the subsidy allocation for LPG, directly impacting the price for eligible consumers.", "normalised": "Beyond the international market, domestic policies play a pivotal role.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, taxes levied by both the central and state governments contribute to the final retail price. Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies across states, adds another layer of complexity to the pricing structure. Transportation costs, from refineries to bottling plants and finally to distributors, also add to the overall expense. Consider the logistical challenges of supplying LPG to remote Himalayan villages, impacting the final price compared to metropolitan cities like Mumbai.", "normalised": "Furthermore, taxes levied by both the central and state governments contribute to the final retail price.

{"unnormalised": "The price revision typically happens on the 1st of every month, although mid-month adjustments are not uncommon in response to significant fluctuations in international prices. Consumers can usually check the updated prices on the websites of oil marketing companies like Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum, or through their mobile apps. A common practice is to verify the price at the time of delivery, ensuring alignment with the official rates. A recent price hike on 15/04/2024, around 14:00 hrs, triggered widespread discussion and debate regarding affordability.", "normalised": "The price revision typically happens on the first of every month, although mid-month adjustments are not uncommon in response to significant fluctuations in international prices.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing of commercial gas cylinders, often used in restaurants and small businesses, follows a different mechanism. These cylinders generally do not receive subsidies, and their prices are more directly linked to market forces. This distinction is important to note, as fluctuations in commercial cylinder prices can have a direct impact on the cost of eating out and other services.", "normalised": "The pricing of commercial gas cylinders, often used in restaurants and small businesses, follows a different mechanism.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, understanding the intricacies of gas cylinder pricing is crucial for informed consumer choices. Government policies and international market trends will continue to shape the landscape, demanding constant vigilance and adaptation from both consumers and energy providers. The effectiveness of current policies are often debated, with analysts pointing out the need for sustainable solutions and transparent pricing mechanisms in the long run. For instance, the discussion on linking LPG prices to alternative, renewable energy sources gained momentum after the 1991 economic reforms. These reforms triggered a paradigm shift in how India approaches energy security and sustainability.", "normalised": "Moving forward, understanding the intricacies of gas cylinder pricing is crucial for informed consumer choices.
