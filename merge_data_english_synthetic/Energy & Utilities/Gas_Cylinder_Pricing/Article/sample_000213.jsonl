{"unnormalised": "Historically, LPG pricing in India was heavily regulated. The government provided substantial subsidies to ensure affordability, particularly for domestic consumers. However, in recent years, there's been a gradual shift towards a more market-linked pricing mechanism. This transition aims to reduce the financial burden on the exchequer and encourage efficient resource allocation. Despite the move towards deregulation, the government continues to play a vital role, particularly in cushioning the impact of volatile global prices on vulnerable sections of society.", "normalised": "Historically, L P G pricing in India was heavily regulated.

{"unnormalised": "The price of a gas cylinder in India is typically composed of several components. Firstly, the cost of the raw material (crude oil) is a major determinant. India imports a significant portion of its crude oil, making it susceptible to fluctuations in international markets. Secondly, refining costs and transportation charges add to the overall expense. Thirdly, taxes levied by both the central and state governments contribute to the final price. Finally, distribution margins charged by dealers and distributors are factored in.", "normalised": "The price of a gas cylinder in India is typically composed of several components.

As of 10:00 hrs on that date, the unsubsidized price stood at Rs. 900, a figure which can vary considerably depending on state-specific taxes and applicable subsidies. Commercial cylinders, used by restaurants and businesses in places like Chennai or Kolkata, are priced differently and typically don't receive subsidies.", "normalised": "The price of a fourteen point two kilogram domestic L P G cylinder in Delhi, for instance, was revised on first january two thousand and twenty four.

{"unnormalised": "Recent events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, have significantly impacted global energy markets, leading to upward pressure on LPG prices. The Indian government has responded by adjusting subsidy levels and exploring alternative sourcing options. For instance, during the peak of the crisis in mid-2022, concerns arose about prices potentially reaching Rs. 1200 per cylinder.", "normalised": "Recent events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, have significantly impacted global energy markets, leading to upward pressure on L P G prices.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, a sustainable LPG pricing policy for India requires a balanced approach. This includes promoting domestic production of LPG, diversifying import sources, and continuing to refine subsidy mechanisms to ensure they reach the intended beneficiaries. Furthermore, raising public awareness about energy conservation and promoting the adoption of alternative cooking fuels are crucial steps towards a more sustainable energy future.
