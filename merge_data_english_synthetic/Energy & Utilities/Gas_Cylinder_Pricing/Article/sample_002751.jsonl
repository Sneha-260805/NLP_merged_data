Well, apart from grumbling to our neighbors (which, let's be honest, is a national pastime), we can try to be more conscious about our gas usage. Small things like using pressure cookers, soaking dals before cooking, and making sure our burner flames are blue (that means efficient combustion!) can make a difference. Every little bit helps, right? And maybe, just maybe, write to your M P. Who knows, it might actually make a difference… probably not, but hey, worth a shot!"}
