{"unnormalised": "The fundamental price of LPG is determined by global crude oil prices. India imports a significant portion of its LPG, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the international market. Any increase in the price of crude oil directly translates into a higher import cost for Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL). These OMCs then pass on a portion of this increase to consumers.", "normalised": "The fundamental price of L P G is determined by global crude oil prices.

{"unnormalised": "However, the final price consumers pay is not solely dictated by global crude prices. Government policies, including subsidies and taxation, play a significant role. The Indian government, through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), provides subsidized LPG cylinders to eligible households. These subsidies aim to make clean cooking fuel accessible to economically weaker sections of society. The level of subsidy can be adjusted based on budgetary considerations and policy priorities, impacting the final consumer price. For example, a major subsidy revision occurred on 01/01/2023, affecting millions of beneficiaries.", "normalised": "However, the final price consumers pay is not solely dictated by global crude prices.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, state-level taxes, particularly Value Added Tax (VAT), also contribute to variations in LPG prices across different states. The transportation costs from refineries and import terminals to distribution centers also factor into the final price. Distribution networks in remote areas like the Himalayan region incur higher transportation costs, leading to slightly elevated prices for consumers in those regions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, state-level taxes, particularly Value Added Tax (V A T), also contribute to variations in L P G prices across different states.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing mechanism is typically reviewed and revised monthly by the OMCs, usually around the 1st of each month, effective from 00:00 hrs. Consumers can track price changes through official OMC websites and news outlets. Fluctuations can be significant, with price hikes often sparking public debate and political commentary. For instance, a particularly steep increase was recorded on 15/04/2024, prompting widespread discussion on its impact on household finances, particularly among middle-class families in cities like Chennai and Delhi.", "normalised": "The pricing mechanism is typically reviewed and revised monthly by the O M Cs, usually around the first of each month, effective from zero zero colon zero zero hours.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the increasing adoption of alternative energy sources like biogas and solar cookers may gradually reduce India's reliance on LPG. However, LPG will remain a dominant cooking fuel for a considerable period, and understanding its pricing dynamics will continue to be relevant. In a press conference held on 10/07/2024 at 11:00 hrs, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas addressed concerns regarding rising LPG prices and reiterated the government's commitment to providing affordable cooking fuel to all citizens. Continuous monitoring of global markets, strategic policy adjustments, and promoting domestic production of LPG are essential for ensuring stable and predictable pricing in the long term.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the increasing adoption of alternative energy sources like biogas and solar cookers may gradually reduce India's reliance on L P G.
