You’re alone! The price of cooking gas (L P G) cylinders in India seems to be on a rollercoaster, leaving many of us wondering what’s going on. One month it's rupees one thousand one hundred, the next it's flirting with rupees one thousand two hundred. Seriously, how are we supposed to afford those delicious aloo parathas and biryanis?"}
{"unnormalised": "**Gas Cylinder Prices: Why are my Rotis Getting More Expensive?**", "normalised": "It's not just your imagination; gas cylinder prices are fluctuating. A big chunk of it comes down to global crude oil prices. India imports a massive amount of its crude oil, and when those international prices go up, it directly impacts what you pay for your L P G cylinder. Think of it like that scene in \"Gangs of Wasseypur\" where Sardar Khan says, \"Beta, tumse na ho payega.” Well, sometimes controlling global oil prices feels just like that! We just can't."}
{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, ever felt like your monthly budget is being held hostage by… your gas cylinder? You’re not alone! The price of cooking gas (LPG) cylinders in India seems to be on a rollercoaster, leaving many of us wondering what’s going on. One month it's Rs. 1100, the next it's flirting with Rs. 1200. Seriously, how are we supposed to afford those delicious aloo parathas and biryanis?", "normalised": "Another factor is the government's subsidy policy. Remember those days when cylinders were heavily subsidized? Well, those subsidies have been tweaked and adjusted over time. Some consumers get a direct benefit transfer (D B T) into their bank accounts, while others pay the market price upfront. This D B T scheme is like getting a cashback offer on your favourite online shopping site, only it's for something essential."}

They take into account factors like the global L P G prices, the exchange rate between the Rupee and the U S Dollar (because, you know, we're buying that L P G in dollars!), and other operational costs. These calculations are generally done following guidelines that are overseen by the Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (P P A C), a body under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas."}

Well, besides making sure your cylinder is properly sealed and doesn't have any leaks (safety first, folks!), staying informed about the government's policies and global oil trends can help you anticipate price changes. Maybe we should all start learning to cook on solar cookers! Or perhaps, we should just accept that the price of rotis is, unfortunately, going to keep changing. At least the food will be delicious, right? Hopefully, the government will find a way to stabilize prices soon."}
