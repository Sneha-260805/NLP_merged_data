{"unnormalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, primarily used for cooking in Indian homes, is determined by a combination of international market prices, government subsidies, and various taxes. State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) play a significant role in setting the retail prices. These companies adjust prices on a monthly basis, typically around the 1st of each month, reflecting changes in global crude oil rates and currency exchange rates.", "normalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders, primarily used for cooking in Indian homes, is determined by a combination of international market prices, government subsidies, and various taxes.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India provides subsidies on LPG cylinders to eligible households under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), aimed at providing clean cooking fuel to below-poverty-line (BPL) families. These subsidies help cushion the impact of rising international prices on vulnerable populations. However, the subsidy structure and its implementation have often been subject to debate and revisions. For instance, the subsidy amount can fluctuate drastically, as witnessed during the period leading up to Diwali on 24/10/2022, causing confusion among consumers.", "normalised": "The Government of India provides subsidies on L P G cylinders to eligible households under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (P M U Y), aimed at providing clean cooking fuel to below-poverty-line (B P L) families.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence the international market prices of LPG. Geopolitical events, such as conflicts in major oil-producing regions, can significantly impact supply and drive up prices. Similarly, seasonal demand fluctuations, particularly during winter months in countries with high LPG consumption, can also contribute to price volatility. The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (Rs.) and the US Dollar (USD) also plays a critical role, as India imports a significant portion of its LPG needs. A weaker Rupee increases the cost of imports, leading to higher prices for consumers.", "normalised": "Several factors influence the international market prices of L P G.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, transportation costs from refineries and import terminals to distribution points across the vast Indian landscape add to the final price. The distance from a refinery to a remote village in Rajasthan, for example, will invariably affect the delivered cost. Dealers also add their commission, which contributes to the final cost for the consumer.", "normalised": "Furthermore, transportation costs from refineries and import terminals to distribution points across the vast Indian landscape add to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Analyzing historical data reveals that LPG prices have shown a steady increase over the past decade. In 2014, a non-subsidized 14.2 kg cylinder cost approximately Rs. 410. By 2023, the price had risen significantly, sometimes exceeding Rs. 1100, highlighting the growing financial burden on households. These price hikes have led to protests and calls for greater government intervention to stabilize LPG prices and protect consumers. On 15/08/1947, access to such resources was merely a dream for many, illustrating how far the country has come, yet affordability remains a challenge.", "normalised": "Analyzing historical data reveals that L P G prices have shown a steady increase over the past decade. In two thousand and fourteen, a non-subsidized fourteen point two kilogram cylinder cost approximately rupees four hundred and ten. By two thousand and twenty three, the price had risen significantly, sometimes exceeding rupees one thousand one hundred, highlighting the growing financial burden on households. These price hikes have led to protests and calls for greater government intervention to stabilize L P G prices and protect consumers. On fifteenth August nineteen forty seven, access to such resources was merely a dream for many, illustrating how far the country has come, yet affordability remains a challenge."}
{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian government is exploring various strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuating LPG prices. These include promoting the use of alternative fuels, such as biogas and compressed natural gas (CNG), and increasing domestic LPG production to reduce reliance on imports. Policy discussions often take place at the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) in Delhi around 09:00 hrs, focused on forecasting trends and formulating strategies. Furthermore, improving the efficiency of LPG distribution networks and streamlining the subsidy disbursement mechanism are crucial steps towards ensuring affordable and accessible cooking fuel for all Indians. Understanding these factors is key to navigating the complex world of gas cylinder pricing and ensuring energy security for the nation.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian government is exploring various strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuating L P G prices.
