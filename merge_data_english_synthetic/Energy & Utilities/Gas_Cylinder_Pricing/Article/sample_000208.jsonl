{"unnormalised": "The central determinant of LPG cylinder prices is the international benchmark crude oil price. India imports a significant portion of its crude oil needs, and fluctuations in global markets directly impact the cost of sourcing LPG. Further adding to the complexity is the currency exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (Rs.) and the US Dollar, as crude oil is typically traded in USD. A weakening Rupee translates to higher import costs, further influencing the final price at the consumer level.", "normalised": "The central determinant of L P G cylinder prices is the international benchmark crude oil price.

{"unnormalised": "Government subsidies also play a significant role. The Indian government, through entities like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), historically provided subsidies on LPG cylinders to alleviate the burden on consumers, particularly those belonging to economically weaker sections. These subsidies are subject to periodic revisions based on budgetary allocations and government priorities. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), launched to provide LPG connections to impoverished households, has also impacted the overall demand and subsequent pricing models.", "normalised": "Government subsidies also play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "The price of a 14.2 kg LPG cylinder in Delhi, for example, is frequently revised on a monthly basis. These revisions are typically announced around the 1st of each month, taking into account the factors mentioned above. While direct subsidies have been altered over time with DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes, the effective cost for consumers is still influenced by the government’s policies. Consumers often receive the market price upfront and the subsidy amount is then credited directly to their bank accounts.", "normalised": "The price of a fourteen point two kilogram L P G cylinder in Delhi, for example, is frequently revised on a monthly basis.

{"unnormalised": "Distribution costs and local taxes also contribute to the final price. Transportation from refineries to bottling plants, and then to distributors and retailers, adds to the overall cost. State-level taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT), further differentiate the price across different regions of India. A cylinder in Mumbai might cost slightly different from one in Kolkata due to these regional variations.", "normalised": "Distribution costs and local taxes also contribute to the final price.
