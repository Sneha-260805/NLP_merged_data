{"unnormalised": "Currently, the price of an LPG cylinder, primarily used by households under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, is a combination of the base price, freight charges, bottling charges, marketing costs, Goods and Services Tax (GST), and dealer commission. The base price, in turn, is influenced by the international benchmark prices of propane and butane, the primary components of LPG. Fluctuations in these global commodity markets directly impact the cost incurred by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the major public sector oil marketing companies.", "normalised": "Currently, the price of an L P G cylinder, primarily used by households under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, is a combination of the base price, freight charges, bottling charges, marketing costs, Goods and Services Tax (G S T), and dealer commission.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has historically played a significant role in subsidizing LPG cylinders to cushion consumers from price volatility. This subsidy is typically provided in two ways: direct benefit transfer (DBT) and under-recovery compensation to oil marketing companies. The DBT scheme, introduced several years ago, credits the subsidy amount directly to the consumer's bank account linked to their Aadhaar number after they purchase the cylinder at market price. However, the level of subsidy can vary depending on government policy and international prices. As of 10/10/2024, the subsidized rate for a 14.2 kg cylinder under the Ujjwala scheme stands at approximately Rs. 800 in Delhi, with fluctuations observed across different states due to varying transportation costs.", "normalised": "The Indian government has historically played a significant role in subsidizing L P G cylinders to cushion consumers from price volatility.

{"unnormalised": "Recently, there have been discussions around rationalizing LPG subsidies and exploring alternative energy sources to reduce reliance on imported LPG. The rising global energy prices, exacerbated by geopolitical events, have put immense pressure on the Indian government's exchequer. Experts from institutions like NITI Aayog have suggested promoting biogas and solar cooking solutions in rural areas as viable alternatives. The \"Give it Up\" campaign, launched on 15/08/2015 by Prime Minister Modi, encouraged financially well-off individuals to voluntarily forego their LPG subsidy, contributing to a reduction in the subsidy burden on the government.", "normalised": "Recently, there have been discussions around rationalizing L P G subsidies and exploring alternative energy sources to reduce reliance on imported L P G.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these efforts, LPG remains a crucial component of the Indian energy mix. The pricing mechanism, while seemingly opaque, is designed to balance the affordability for consumers with the financial viability of oil marketing companies. Any significant changes to the pricing policy, such as a complete deregulation of LPG prices, would have far-reaching consequences, potentially impacting the household budgets of millions and potentially leading to social unrest. Furthermore, the availability and timely delivery of LPG cylinders, especially in remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, are critical factors that need to be addressed to ensure energy security. The next meeting of the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) to review LPG prices is scheduled for 09:00 hrs on 30/11/2024, and any decisions taken there will be closely watched by consumers and industry stakeholders alike. The long-term sustainability of LPG as a primary cooking fuel in India hinges on finding a balance between affordability, accessibility, and environmental considerations. The current pricing system, while imperfect, reflects the ongoing efforts to navigate these complex challenges.", "normalised": "Despite these efforts, L P G remains a crucial component of the Indian energy mix.
