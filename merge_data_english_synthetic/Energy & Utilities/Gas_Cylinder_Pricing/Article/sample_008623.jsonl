{"unnormalised": "The primary determinant of LPG cylinder pricing is the international benchmark rate for propane and butane, the two main components of LPG. These rates are subject to fluctuations based on global supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and currency exchange rates. Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the major public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), import significant volumes of LPG to meet domestic demand. The import parity price (IPP), which reflects the cost of importing LPG into India, plays a significant role in the eventual retail price.", "normalised": "The primary determinant of L P G cylinder pricing is the international benchmark rate for propane and butane, the two main components of L P G.

{"unnormalised": "Government subsidies play a significant role in cushioning Indian consumers from the full impact of international price volatility. Subsidized LPG cylinders are provided to eligible households under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), aimed at providing clean cooking fuel to below poverty line (BPL) families. However, the amount of subsidy and the eligibility criteria are subject to periodic revisions by the government, often leading to public discourse. For instance, changes were last notified on 20/07/2023.", "normalised": "Government subsidies play a significant role in cushioning Indian consumers from the full impact of international price volatility.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the international benchmark and government subsidies, other factors influence the final price. These include transportation costs from import terminals to bottling plants and distribution networks, bottling charges, marketing expenses incurred by the OMCs, and applicable taxes levied by both the central and state governments. State-level taxes, like Value Added Tax (VAT), vary considerably, leading to price differences across states. A cylinder might cost Rs. 1100 in Delhi, while the same could be priced at Rs. 1180 in Mumbai, primarily due to the differing VAT rates.", "normalised": "Beyond the international benchmark and government subsidies, other factors influence the final price.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing mechanism is adjusted periodically, usually on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the aforementioned factors. These revisions often take place at 09:00 hrs on the 1st of each month. This process, while transparent in its attempt to reflect market realities, can create uncertainty for consumers who find it difficult to predict their monthly expenditure on cooking fuel.", "normalised": "The pricing mechanism is adjusted periodically, usually on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the aforementioned factors.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of rising LPG prices is felt most acutely by low-income households and small businesses, like roadside dhabas and restaurants in places like Meerut, who heavily rely on LPG for their operations.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian government is actively promoting alternative fuels, such as biogas and compressed biogas (CBG), to reduce dependence on imported LPG and promote energy security. Furthermore, initiatives to improve the efficiency of LPG stoves and promote responsible consumption can help mitigate the financial burden on households. The future of gas cylinder pricing in India will likely be shaped by a combination of global market dynamics, government policies, and the adoption of sustainable energy alternatives. This was especially apparent after the budgetary announcements made on 01/02/2024.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian government is actively promoting alternative fuels, such as biogas and compressed biogas (C B G), to reduce dependence on imported L P G and promote energy security.
