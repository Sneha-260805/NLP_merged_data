{"unnormalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, a ubiquitous energy source in Indian households, is a subject of constant scrutiny and debate. Affecting everything from domestic cooking to small-scale industries, its pricing mechanism is a complex interplay of global crude oil prices, government policies, and distribution costs. This article delves into the intricacies of this system, focusing on the factors that influence the cost of a gas cylinder for the average Indian consumer.", "normalised": "The price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders, a ubiquitous energy source in Indian households, is a subject of constant scrutiny and debate.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, LPG prices in India were heavily subsidized by the government. This policy aimed to make cooking gas affordable for lower-income families and address energy poverty, particularly in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. However, the subsidy regime led to significant fiscal burdens and inefficiencies. Consequently, reforms were initiated to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate subsidies for non-BPL (Below Poverty Line) households. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, like the PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantarit Labh) scheme, were introduced to transfer subsidy amounts directly into consumers' bank accounts, aiming for greater transparency and efficiency.", "normalised": "Historically, L P G prices in India were heavily subsidized by the government.

{"unnormalised": "The primary driver of LPG cylinder prices is the international price of propane and butane, the primary constituents of LPG. These prices are benchmarked against global markets and are susceptible to fluctuations based on geopolitical events, supply disruptions, and demand patterns. For instance, the tensions in the Middle East often trigger a spike in crude oil prices, which subsequently impacts LPG prices in India. These fluctuations are reflected in the prices announced by oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) on a monthly basis. Price revisions typically happen on the 1st of every month, with announcements made around 09:00 hrs.", "normalised": "The primary driver of L P G cylinder prices is the international price of propane and butane, the primary constituents of L P G.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the price paid by the consumer includes various other charges, such as transportation costs from refineries and bottling plants to distributors, bottling charges, marketing margins of OMCs, and local taxes levied by state governments. These add a considerable markup to the base price. For example, transporting a cylinder from a bottling plant in Panipat, Haryana, to a distributor in Guwahati, Assam, involves significant logistical costs, which are ultimately borne by the consumer.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the price paid by the consumer includes various other charges, such as transportation costs from refineries and bottling plants to distributors, bottling charges, marketing margins of O M Cs, and local taxes levied by state governments.

While the exact GST rate may vary depending on government decisions, it contributes to the overall cost. On 15/08/1947, a free India envisioned affordable energy access for all its citizens.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of LPG price fluctuations is particularly felt by low-income households and small businesses such as roadside eateries (dhabas) who rely heavily on LPG for their daily operations. Therefore, the government's decision on the extent of subsidies and the frequency of price revisions are crucial considerations, with a direct bearing on household budgets and economic activity. The price of a 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi on 26/01/2023 might be different from the price in Chennai due to variations in local taxes and transportation costs. Currently, the price can range between Rs. 900 to Rs. 1100 depending on the location and subsidy status. The announcement of new LPG prices on 1st June 2024 will be closely watched by consumers across India. It reflects the ongoing balancing act between economic realities and social welfare objectives.", "normalised": "The impact of L P G price fluctuations is particularly felt by low-income households and small businesses such as roadside eateries (dhabas) who rely heavily on L P G for their daily operations.
