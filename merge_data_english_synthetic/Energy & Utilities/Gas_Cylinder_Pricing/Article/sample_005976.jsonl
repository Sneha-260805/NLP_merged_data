{"unnormalised": "The price of a domestic LPG cylinder in India is not a fixed entity. It fluctuates based on a confluence of international crude oil prices, refinery processing costs, transportation charges, government subsidies, and taxes levied by both central and state governments. The primary benchmark is the international price of propane and butane, the key components of LPG. Fluctuations in these global prices, often denominated in US dollars, are directly translated into changes for Indian consumers, though the impact is often cushioned by government interventions.", "normalised": "The price of a domestic L P G cylinder in India is not a fixed entity.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, the Indian government has played a significant role in subsidizing LPG to make it affordable, particularly for lower-income families. Schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) have provided subsidized connections to millions of households, significantly increasing LPG penetration across the country. However, the level of subsidy varies and is subject to revisions based on budgetary allocations and policy priorities. A key example of this was the subsidy adjustment implemented on 20/10/2023, leading to nationwide discussions on the implications for household expenses.", "normalised": "Historically, the Indian government has played a significant role in subsidizing L P G to make it affordable, particularly for lower-income families.

{"unnormalised": "The retail price of a gas cylinder varies from state to state due to differences in local taxes, transportation costs within the state, and dealer commissions. This means that a cylinder in Mumbai may cost slightly more or less than the same cylinder in, say, Patna or Lucknow. Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) are the primary distributors of LPG in India. They periodically revise prices, typically on a monthly basis, taking into account the aforementioned factors. These revisions are usually announced around the 1st of each month, with changes taking effect at 00:00 hrs.", "normalised": "The retail price of a gas cylinder varies from state to state due to differences in local taxes, transportation costs within the state, and dealer commissions.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of LPG price fluctuations extends beyond the individual household. Small businesses, such as tea stalls and street food vendors who rely heavily on LPG, are also significantly affected. Furthermore, the pricing of commercial LPG cylinders, used by restaurants and other commercial establishments, follows a different trajectory, often being higher than domestic cylinders due to the absence of subsidies.", "normalised": "The impact of L P G price fluctuations extends beyond the individual household.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the government's focus on promoting alternative and cleaner cooking fuels, such as biogas and electric stoves, may gradually reduce reliance on LPG. However, in the foreseeable future, the gas cylinder will remain a critical energy source for a vast majority of Indian homes. Consumers are advised to stay informed about pricing changes, understand the subsidy mechanisms available, and explore energy-efficient cooking practices to mitigate the impact of price volatility. One can track real-time updates and historical data on the website of the Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) which, as of 15/08/1947, wasn’t tracking gas prices, but certainly does now. For example, on 26/01/2024, the price of a 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi was Rs. 903.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the government's focus on promoting alternative and cleaner cooking fuels, such as biogas and electric stoves, may gradually reduce reliance on L P G.
