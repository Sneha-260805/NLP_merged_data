{"unnormalised": "Gas cylinder pricing in India is a complex interplay of global energy markets, government policies, and logistical considerations. Primarily used for domestic cooking needs, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders are a vital component of the Indian household, impacting budgets and overall quality of life, especially for lower-income families. Understanding the factors influencing these prices is crucial for both consumers and policymakers.", "normalised": "Gas cylinder pricing in India is a complex interplay of global energy markets, government policies, and logistical considerations.

{"unnormalised": "The primary determinants of LPG cylinder prices are international crude oil prices and the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar. As India imports a significant portion of its LPG requirements, fluctuations in global oil prices directly translate to changes in the cost of importing the gas. The government also plays a crucial role through subsidies and taxation. Subsidies, primarily targeting vulnerable sections of society under schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, aim to alleviate the burden of high prices. However, the extent of these subsidies can vary depending on budgetary constraints and government policy decisions.", "normalised": "The primary determinants of L P G cylinder prices are international crude oil prices and the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the U S Dollar.

{"unnormalised": "Currently, consumers often encounter two types of LPG cylinders: subsidized and non-subsidized. Subsidized cylinders are available to eligible households, while non-subsidized cylinders are priced at the market rate. The difference between these two prices reflects the subsidy component borne by the government. The process of claiming subsidies often involves direct benefit transfer (DBT) to the consumer's bank account, ensuring transparency and efficiency in distribution.", "normalised": "Currently, consumers often encounter two types of L P G cylinders: subsidized and non-subsidized.

{"unnormalised": "Distribution also adds to the final cost. Companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) are responsible for sourcing, bottling, and distributing LPG across the country. Transportation costs, storage charges, and dealer commissions all contribute to the final price paid by the consumer. The geographical location also influences price variations. Remote areas, requiring longer transportation distances, often experience higher prices.", "normalised": "Distribution also adds to the final cost.

{"unnormalised": "The government typically revises LPG cylinder prices on a monthly basis, often around the 1st of the month, based on prevailing global prices and exchange rates. For instance, there was a significant price hike effective from 00:00 hrs on 01/03/2023, reflecting rising international energy costs. Prices are announced by major oil marketing companies and are often reflected in news reports and company websites. Consumers can also check prevailing prices through designated online portals and mobile applications.", "normalised": "The government typically revises L P G cylinder prices on a monthly basis, often around the first of the month, based on prevailing global prices and exchange rates.

{"unnormalised": "Several reports have highlighted the impact of high LPG prices on household budgets, particularly after the period of global energy crisis post 24/02/2022. Organizations like the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) have conducted studies on the affordability of LPG and its impact on cooking fuel choices in different income groups.
