{"unnormalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in India is a complex interplay of global market forces, government policies, and domestic considerations. This vital energy source, used in millions of Indian households, particularly for cooking, is subject to fluctuations that directly impact the common man's budget. Understanding the factors driving these price changes is crucial for informed citizenry and effective policy advocacy.", "normalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders in India is a complex interplay of global market forces, government policies, and domestic considerations.

{"unnormalised": "Several key elements contribute to the final retail price of an LPG cylinder. Firstly, the international price of crude oil and propane, the raw materials for LPG production, plays a significant role. India imports a substantial portion of its LPG needs, making it vulnerable to global price volatility. Events in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, major LPG exporters, can have a ripple effect on prices in the Indian market.", "normalised": "Several key elements contribute to the final retail price of an L P G cylinder.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, government policies, particularly subsidies and taxes, influence the end cost to consumers. Subsidies, aimed at making LPG affordable for vulnerable sections of society, are directly linked to cylinder prices. Any reduction or increase in these subsidies translates to a corresponding change in the price paid by households. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, known as PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hastantarit Labh), directly transfers the subsidy amount to the consumer's bank account after they purchase the cylinder at market price. This was implemented nationwide by 01/01/2015.", "normalised": "Secondly, government policies, particularly subsidies and taxes, influence the end cost to consumers.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, transportation and distribution costs contribute to the final price. Moving LPG from refineries and import terminals to bottling plants and finally to distributors across a vast country like India incurs significant expenses. The distance covered, the mode of transport (road, rail), and the efficiency of the supply chain all impact the cost. For instance, delivering cylinders to remote villages in the Himalayas incurs higher costs compared to urban centers like Mumbai.", "normalised": "Thirdly, transportation and distribution costs contribute to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, state-level taxes and levies further add to the final price. These taxes vary across states, leading to price disparities. For example, the cost of an LPG cylinder in Rajasthan might differ from that in Tamil Nadu due to differing tax structures.", "normalised": "Furthermore, state-level taxes and levies further add to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "The frequency of price revisions also impacts consumers. Until recently, prices were revised monthly based on international market trends. However, more frequent, even fortnightly, adjustments are now common. Price adjustments are typically announced on the 1st of every month at 09:00 hrs by companies like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL).", "normalised": "The frequency of price revisions also impacts consumers.

{"unnormalised": "Recent price hikes, such as the one announced on 16/08/2023, citing increased global energy prices, have drawn criticism from consumer groups and opposition parties.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the focus is on diversifying energy sources and promoting alternative cooking fuels to reduce India's dependence on imported LPG. Increased domestic production of LPG, through initiatives like the Ujjwala Yojana, and the adoption of biogas and electric cooking, are seen as long-term solutions to stabilize prices and ensure energy security for all. The Indian government aims to connect all villages with LPG connection by 2030. The next price revision is expected at 00:00 hrs on 01/09/2024, and analysts predict further fluctuations depending on global crude prices.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the focus is on diversifying energy sources and promoting alternative cooking fuels to reduce India's dependence on imported L P G.
