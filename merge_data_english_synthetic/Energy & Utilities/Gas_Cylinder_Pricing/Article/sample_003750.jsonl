{"unnormalised": "Historically, LPG prices in India were heavily subsidized by the government. This intervention aimed to make essential fuel accessible to a larger segment of the population, especially those Below Poverty Line (BPL). However, this subsidy regime placed a significant burden on the national exchequer. Over time, the government has gradually moved towards a system of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), where consumers pay the market price for the cylinder and receive a subsidy directly into their bank accounts. This shift was intended to curb leakages and improve the efficiency of subsidy delivery.", "normalised": "Historically, L P G prices in India were heavily subsidized by the government.

{"unnormalised": "The international benchmark for LPG prices is a crucial factor. Fluctuations in global crude oil prices, geopolitical instability in major oil-producing regions, and currency exchange rates all have a cascading effect on the cost of importing LPG into India. These factors are largely beyond the control of domestic authorities and contribute significantly to the volatility observed in cylinder prices. For instance, a sudden spike in crude oil prices following an event like the attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility on 20/07/2023 at 14:00 hrs invariably translates to higher import costs for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), the major players in the LPG market.", "normalised": "The international benchmark for L P G prices is a crucial factor.

Transportation costs from refineries and bottling plants to distribution centers across the vast Indian landscape, including challenging terrains in regions like the Northeast, also contribute to regional price variations.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Goods and Services Tax (G S T) levied on L P G cylinders also adds to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "The frequency of price revisions is another important aspect. Typically, LPG prices are revised on a monthly basis, usually around the 1st of each month, by the oil marketing companies (OMCs). These revisions take into account the average international prices of LPG during the preceding weeks and the prevailing exchange rates. Unexpected political events or policy changes can also trigger ad-hoc price adjustments, as seen during the budget announcement on 01/02/2024.", "normalised": "The frequency of price revisions is another important aspect.

{"unnormalised": "The subsidized and non-subsidized categories add another layer of complexity. Eligible households, identified through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, receive a specific number of subsidized cylinders per year. Any additional cylinders purchased beyond this quota are charged at the market price. The differential pricing ensures that vulnerable sections of society continue to receive targeted support. A consumer named Mrs. Sharma in Delhi, for example, is entitled to 12 subsidized cylinders annually.", "normalised": "The subsidized and non-subsidized categories add another layer of complexity.

Understanding these factors is crucial for both consumers and policymakers to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of energy pricing in a developing economy like India. The recent price cut of Rs. 200 per cylinder announced on 30/08/2023 by the Union Cabinet, for instance, was a politically significant move ahead of state elections.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the price of a gas cylinder in India is a reflection of global energy markets, domestic economic policies, and logistical considerations.
