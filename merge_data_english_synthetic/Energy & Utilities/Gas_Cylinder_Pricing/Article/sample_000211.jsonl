{"unnormalised": "Firstly, it's crucial to recognize that India heavily relies on imports to meet its LPG demand. Therefore, international crude oil prices, quoted in US dollars, significantly impact the cost of LPG procurement. Any upward trend in global oil markets directly translates to increased import costs for Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). These OMCs subsequently adjust the retail price of LPG cylinders to reflect these changes. The timing of these adjustments is often debated, but they typically occur on a monthly basis, or sometimes even sooner if volatility is high.", "normalised": "Firstly, it's crucial to recognize that India heavily relies on imports to meet its L P G demand.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, government subsidies play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of global price fluctuations on domestic consumers, particularly those from economically weaker sections. The Government of India provides subsidies on a certain number of LPG cylinders per household annually, attempting to shield vulnerable populations from excessive price shocks. The subsidy amount varies depending on factors such as household income and government policies in place at any given time. These subsidy schemes have evolved over time, with direct benefit transfer (DBT) mechanisms, like Pahal, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce leakages. The launch of Pahal was a watershed moment, streamlining the process and ensuring subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries directly into their bank accounts.", "normalised": "Secondly, government subsidies play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of global price fluctuations on domestic consumers, particularly those from economically weaker sections.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, taxation policies imposed by both the central and state governments also contribute to the final price. Value Added Tax (VAT), levied by state governments, differs across states, leading to variations in LPG cylinder prices from Delhi to Chennai. The Central Excise Duty imposed by the central government also impacts the overall cost.", "normalised": "Furthermore, taxation policies imposed by both the central and state governments also contribute to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Recent geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have significantly impacted global energy markets, leading to unprecedented price volatility in LPG prices. During peak periods, families in metropolitan cities like Mumbai were paying significantly higher prices than in previous years. The impact on rural households, where LPG is a primary cooking fuel, has been even more pronounced. The situation was particularly challenging around 09:00 hrs on 26/01/2023, amidst Republic Day celebrations, as many struggled with rising kitchen expenses.", "normalised": "Recent geopolitical events, such as the Russia slash Ukraine conflict, have significantly impacted global energy markets, leading to unprecedented price volatility in L P G prices.
