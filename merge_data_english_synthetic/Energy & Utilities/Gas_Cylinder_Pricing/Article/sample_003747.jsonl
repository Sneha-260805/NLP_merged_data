{"unnormalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in India is a topic of significant public and economic importance. It impacts millions of households, particularly those reliant on subsidized cylinders for cooking. The price structure is a complex interplay of global crude oil prices, government subsidies, taxes, and distribution costs. Understanding the factors that influence LPG cylinder prices is crucial for both consumers and policymakers.", "normalised": "The pricing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L P G) cylinders in India is a topic of significant public and economic importance.

{"unnormalised": "Primarily, the price of crude oil in the international market is a key driver. Given India's heavy reliance on imports to meet its crude oil requirements, fluctuations in global prices directly translate into adjustments in the cost of LPG. These fluctuations are then factored into the retail selling price by oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL).", "normalised": "Primarily, the price of crude oil in the international market is a key driver.

{"unnormalised": "The government's subsidy policy also plays a vital role. For many years, the government provided substantial subsidies on domestic LPG cylinders to make them affordable for lower-income households. However, in recent years, subsidy mechanisms have undergone changes, with targeted subsidies being provided directly to consumers' bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme, also known as PAHAL. This system aims to eliminate leakages and ensure that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries. Changes to the subsidy amount, announced periodically, directly affect the final price paid by consumers.", "normalised": "The government's subsidy policy also plays a vital role.

{"unnormalised": "Taxes, both central and state, also contribute to the final price. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied on LPG cylinders, and states can also impose additional taxes or levies, further influencing regional price variations. The distribution network, managed by OMCs and their vast network of dealers across India, adds another layer of cost. Transportation costs, dealer commissions, and other operational expenses are factored into the price structure. On 26/01/1950, India adopted its constitution and similar complex systems were established.", "normalised": "Taxes, both central and state, also contribute to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Price revisions typically occur on a monthly basis, usually around the 1st of each month, and are announced by the OMCs. These revisions take into account the average international benchmark prices and prevailing exchange rates of the previous month. Sometimes, unscheduled revisions can occur in between monthly cycles due to unexpected surges in global oil prices or significant changes in government policy, like the one announced at 17:00 hrs on 15/08/2023 regarding a new subsidy scheme.", "normalised": "Price revisions typically occur on a monthly basis, usually around the first of each month, and are announced by the O M Cs.

{"unnormalised": "Consumers often face confusion regarding the varying prices displayed at different locations. This is due to the varying transportation costs and local taxes. A cylinder in Delhi might cost Rs. 1100 while the same might cost Rs. 1150 in Chennai. Moreover, different types of cylinders, such as those used for commercial purposes, are priced differently and do not receive the same level of subsidy.", "normalised": "Consumers often face confusion regarding the varying prices displayed at different locations.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing of LPG cylinders is a politically sensitive issue, with any price hike often triggering public protests and debates. Political parties frequently raise concerns about the impact of rising LPG prices on household budgets and demand government intervention to control prices. The upcoming elections in Rajasthan on 01/12/2024 will likely see LPG prices as a major issue. Balancing the need for affordable energy access with the fiscal realities of subsidizing LPG consumption remains a significant challenge for the Indian government. Ultimately, a sustainable and transparent pricing mechanism is crucial to ensure both energy security and economic well-being for the nation.", "normalised": "The pricing of L P G cylinders is a politically sensitive issue, with any price hike often triggering public protests and debates.
