{"unnormalised": "The primary determinant of LPG prices in India is its international price, which is benchmarked against Saudi Aramco’s Contract Price (CP). This benchmark, coupled with prevailing exchange rates between the Indian Rupee (Rs.) and the US Dollar, directly impacts the base price. State-owned Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) then factor in shipping costs, insurance, and other operational expenses.", "normalised": "The primary determinant of L P G prices in India is its international price, which is benchmarked against Saudi Aramco’s Contract Price (C P).

{"unnormalised": "Government subsidies, a key element in making LPG accessible to a large segment of the population, play a vital role in modulating the final price consumers pay. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), launched on 1st May 2016, aimed to provide subsidized LPG connections to women from below poverty line (BPL) households. However, the subsidy structure has evolved over time, leading to variations in the effective price paid by different consumer categories.", "normalised": "Government subsidies, a key element in making L P G accessible to a large segment of the population, play a vital role in modulating the final price consumers pay.

{"unnormalised": "The frequency of price revisions also influences consumer perception. Typically, OMCs revise LPG prices on a monthly basis, usually around the 1st of each month. Significant changes, like the ones observed in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, can trigger widespread discussions and debates. Remember the sharp spike in prices after 14/02/2022? The impact rippled through budgets across countless homes.", "normalised": "The frequency of price revisions also influences consumer perception.

Efficient supply chain management is crucial in ensuring timely delivery and minimizing potential disruptions that could inflate costs. Instances of hoarding or black marketing, though relatively infrequent, can also contribute to localized price increases.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the distribution network, comprising dealers and distributors, adds its margin to the final price.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, factors such as the increasing adoption of alternative fuels, advancements in renewable energy technologies, and potential changes in government policy will shape the future of gas cylinder pricing in India. Predictions from experts at institutions like TERI suggest that we might see a gradual shift towards a market-linked pricing mechanism, with reduced reliance on subsidies, by 2030. Monitoring these developments, along with regular updates from OMCs at approximately 11:00 hrs each day, is essential for consumers to understand and anticipate price fluctuations.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, factors such as the increasing adoption of alternative fuels, advancements in renewable energy technologies, and potential changes in government policy will shape the future of gas cylinder pricing in India.
