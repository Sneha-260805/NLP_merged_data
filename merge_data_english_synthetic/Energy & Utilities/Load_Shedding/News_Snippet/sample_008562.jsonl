Power discoms, such as U P P C L, cite increased demand and infrastructure constraints as primary reasons. Doctor Sharma, a leading energy expert at I I T Kanpur, noted that peak demand has surged beyond twenty two thousand M W in the region, exceeding available capacity. This comes during the festive season when commercial activity and residential electricity consumption rise significantly. Small businesses, especially in sectors like textile manufacturing in Jaipur requiring uninterrupted power for looms in approximately five thousand square feet workshops, are particularly affected. Consumers are expressing frustration over damage to electronic appliances and disruption to daily routines. The economic impact is estimated to be in the range of rupee five hundred crores daily, according to preliminary assessments. Government officials assure that efforts are underway to augment power supply through increased coal supplies to thermal power plants and bolstering grid infrastructure. A complete resolution is expected within the next seven to ten days."}
