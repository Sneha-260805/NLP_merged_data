The government is considering importing coal and diverting power from less affected regions to alleviate the shortages. Meanwhile, citizens are advised to conserve energy and utilize backup systems where available. The Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) encourages the use of energy-efficient appliances to reduce strain on the grid. Some areas, especially in industrial zones, are using diesel generators, though at a cost of approx. Rs. 20 per unit.
