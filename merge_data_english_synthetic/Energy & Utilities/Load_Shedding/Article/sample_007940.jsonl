While considerable progress has been made in expanding power generation and transmission infrastructure, instances of load shedding continue to plague various regions, impacting economic activity and the quality of life for millions.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate and temporary interruption of electricity supply to certain areas, remains a significant challenge within India's energy and utilities sector.

{"unnormalised": "The reasons for load shedding are multifaceted. Primarily, it stems from a supply-demand mismatch, particularly during peak consumption hours. This disparity can be exacerbated by inadequate generation capacity, especially during periods of extreme weather, or due to transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, which in some states can exceed 20%. Coal shortages, a recurring issue, also contribute significantly, as a large percentage of India's electricity is generated by coal-fired power plants. For example, in October 2021, a severe coal shortage led to widespread load shedding across states like Rajasthan and Maharashtra, impacting industries and households alike.", "normalised": "The reasons for load shedding are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding is far-reaching. For businesses, especially SMEs in cities like Coimbatore and Surat, it leads to production disruptions, impacting profitability and potentially leading to job losses. Households experience inconvenience and discomfort, with essential services like fans, lights, and water pumps being unavailable. The situation is particularly dire during the hot summer months when demand for electricity for cooling soars. Students preparing for competitive exams like JEE or NEET also face considerable disruption.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "The government has implemented various initiatives to address load shedding, including the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana for rural electrification and the Integrated Power Development Scheme for urban areas. Investments in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are also crucial to diversifying the energy mix and reducing reliance on coal. Initiatives like the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) aim to improve the financial health of distribution companies (DISCOMs), enabling them to invest in infrastructure upgrades and reduce T&D losses.", "normalised": "The government has implemented various initiatives to address load shedding, including the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana for rural electrification and the Integrated Power Development Scheme for urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Consider the impact during festivals. While Diwali evenings in Delhi are bright with lights, intermittent load shedding can still disrupt the festivities. Even preparing a simple Onam sadhya becomes a challenge when the power goes out unexpectedly. Addressing load shedding requires sustained efforts to improve generation capacity, reduce T&D losses, and promote energy efficiency. The estimated cost of power outages to the Indian economy is substantial, potentially running into Rs. 75,000 crore annually. Moving towards a reliable and uninterrupted power supply is crucial for India's continued economic growth and development, ensuring that even remote villages 50 km from Patna have access to consistent electricity.", "normalised": "Consider the impact during festivals.
