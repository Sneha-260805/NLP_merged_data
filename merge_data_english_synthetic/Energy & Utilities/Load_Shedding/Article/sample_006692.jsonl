{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary shutdown of electricity supply in parts of a power distribution system, remains a significant challenge in India's energy sector. Despite considerable progress in power generation and grid infrastructure, many regions across the country continue to grapple with scheduled and unscheduled power cuts, impacting households, businesses, and essential services.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary shutdown of electricity supply in parts of a power distribution system, remains a significant challenge in India's energy sector.

{"unnormalised": "The causes of load shedding in India are multifaceted. Demand often outstrips supply, particularly during peak hours, such as the sweltering summer months in Delhi or during the festive season when Diwali celebrations lead to increased electricity consumption. Inadequate infrastructure, including aged transmission lines and distribution networks, contributes significantly. Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses, often exceeding 20% in some states like Bihar, further exacerbate the problem. These losses stem from technical issues, theft, and inefficient billing practices. Insufficient investment in renewable energy sources, despite governmental pushes like the National Solar Mission, leaves the nation heavily reliant on thermal power plants, which are susceptible to coal shortages and maintenance downtimes.", "normalised": "The causes of load shedding in India are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in industrial hubs like Ludhiana, suffer significant economic losses due to interrupted production cycles. Hospitals and healthcare facilities in cities like Chennai, heavily depend on backup generators during power outages, increasing operational costs. Students preparing for crucial exams, such as the IIT-JEE, often face disruptions in their studies. The situation is particularly acute in rural areas where access to reliable electricity is already limited, hindering economic development and social progress. Remember the power grid failure on 31/07/2012? A stark reminder of our vulnerabilities.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives such as the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) aim to strengthen distribution networks and provide electricity access to rural households. However, implementation challenges, bureaucratic hurdles, and financial constraints often impede progress. State Electricity Boards (SEBs), often burdened with debt and operational inefficiencies, struggle to maintain a consistent and reliable power supply.", "normalised": "Government initiatives such as the Integrated Power Development Scheme (I P D S) and the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (D D U G J Y) aim to strengthen distribution networks and provide electricity access to rural households.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a comprehensive approach. This includes investing in modernizing transmission and distribution infrastructure, reducing T&D losses through smart grid technologies and stringent enforcement against electricity theft, promoting energy efficiency measures through public awareness campaigns, and diversifying the energy mix by increasing the share of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Furthermore, ensuring timely coal supply to thermal power plants and improving the financial health of SEBs are crucial steps.

{"unnormalised": "The situation, while still challenging, is improving. Many states are showing reduced load shedding durations. A case study in Maharashtra from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023 showed a 15% reduction in unscheduled outages due to improved preventive maintenance. Ultimately, a reliable and affordable electricity supply is essential for India to achieve its economic growth targets and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Further investment and commitment are required to ensure that load shedding becomes a relic of the past.", "normalised": "The situation, while still challenging, is improving.
