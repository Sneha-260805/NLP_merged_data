Remember that scene from \"Lagaan\" where the villagers prayed for rain? Well, we're praying for uninterrupted power supply! Fans become useless decorations, A C S become expensive paperweights, and the kids start complaining about not being able to play their P U B G. And don't even get me started on online classes! Imagine little Rohan trying to attend his Zoom meeting only to have the power go out mid-sentence. Tragedy, I tell you!"}

Sometimes it's simply because there's not enough electricity being generated. India's growing like crazy, and everyone wants to run their gadgets and appliances.

Well, on a personal level, we can be more conscious about our energy consumption. Switch off lights when we leave a room, use energy-efficient appliances, and maybe even consider solar panels.
