{"unnormalised": "The reasons behind load shedding are complex. Sometimes it’s due to insufficient power generation. Maybe a coal plant is down for maintenance, or the monsoon season has affected hydroelectric power generation.

Turning off lights and fans when we leave a room, using energy-efficient appliances, and supporting renewable energy sources are small steps that can make a big difference.
