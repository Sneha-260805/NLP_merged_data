{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding. Rapid economic growth, coupled with increasing urbanization, has fueled a surge in electricity demand. Cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, known for their thriving IT sectors and dense populations, often experience intense pressure on their electricity grids, especially during the summer months when air conditioning usage spikes. Inadequate infrastructure investment in transmission and distribution networks is another critical bottleneck. Old and overloaded power lines are prone to failures, leading to unscheduled outages and necessitating load shedding to stabilize the grid.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "Fluctuations in fuel supply, particularly coal for thermal power plants, further exacerbate the problem. Disruptions in coal mining or transportation can lead to a reduction in electricity generation, forcing distribution companies to implement load shedding schedules to manage the shortfall. The unpredictability of monsoon rains also plays a role. A weak monsoon season can reduce hydroelectric power generation, putting additional strain on other sources.", "normalised": "Fluctuations in fuel supply, particularly coal for thermal power plants, further exacerbate the problem.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding extends beyond mere inconvenience. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in sectors like textiles in Tiruppur or leather goods in Kanpur, face significant disruptions in production, leading to financial losses and reduced competitiveness. Households suffer from curtailed access to essential services such as water supply and healthcare, especially in rural areas. Students preparing for competitive exams, like IIT-JEE or NEET, find their studies disrupted, adding to the stress and pressure. The impact is felt even during festive occasions. Imagine celebrating Onam in Kerala with sudden power outages, dampening the festive spirit.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding extends beyond mere inconvenience.

{"unnormalised": "State electricity boards (SEBs) and private distribution companies are employing various strategies to mitigate load shedding. These include demand-side management techniques, such as promoting energy-efficient appliances and implementing time-of-day tariffs. Investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is crucial for diversifying the energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Strengthening grid infrastructure, upgrading transmission lines, and implementing smart grid technologies are essential for improving the reliability and resilience of the power supply. The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) is also actively involved in monitoring and regulating the performance of distribution companies to ensure equitable access to electricity for all consumers.", "normalised": "State electricity boards (S E Bs) and private distribution companies are employing various strategies to mitigate load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, addressing the challenge of load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach involving sustained investment in infrastructure, diversification of energy sources, efficient demand management, and effective regulatory oversight. Only then can India achieve its goal of providing reliable and affordable electricity to all its citizens and fueling its continued economic growth. In the absence of a reliable electricity supply, even a plate of delicious Hyderabadi biryani cooked at home can lose its savor if the lights go out in the middle of dinner.", "normalised": "Ultimately, addressing the challenge of load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach involving sustained investment in infrastructure, diversification of energy sources, efficient demand management, and effective regulatory oversight.
