{"unnormalised": "Basically, load shedding is when the power company, like Tata Power or maybe your local state electricity board (MSEB in Maharashtra, anyone?), intentionally cuts off electricity supply to certain areas for a specific period. Why? Because the demand for electricity is higher than what they can supply. Think of it like trying to share a single plate of biryani amongst 10 hungry relatives during Eid – someone's going to be left wanting.", "normalised": "Basically, load shedding is when the power company, like Tata Power or maybe your local state electricity board (M S E B in Maharashtra, anyone?), intentionally cuts off electricity supply to certain areas for a specific period.

{"unnormalised": "The reasons are usually a mix of things. Sometimes it's old infrastructure that can't handle the load, other times it's a shortage of coal to power the thermal power plants, or even low water levels impacting hydroelectric power generation, particularly during the monsoon deficit season. Plus, with India's growing population and economy, the demand for electricity is only going to increase. My cousin, Ravi, who works at NTPC, says they're always struggling to keep up.", "normalised": "The reasons are usually a mix of things.

{"unnormalised": "The impact can be significant. Businesses lose productivity, students can't study, and hospitals can face critical issues. Remember that time in Kolkata when a hospital had a blackout for 3 hours? Scary stuff. It's especially tough for small businesses; losing power means losing money, particularly if they are dependent on machinery. I heard a story about a small textile unit in Surat losing Rs. 50,000 due to a prolonged power cut.", "normalised": "The impact can be significant.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Well, investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is crucial. We need to move away from relying solely on coal. Improving the efficiency of existing power plants and upgrading the transmission and distribution network are also essential. And, of course, we all need to be more conscious about conserving electricity at home – switch off those lights, people! My grandmother always used to say, \"Every drop counts!\" Applies to electricity too, I guess. The government also needs to step up, ensuring that power plants have enough coal reserves (like a buffer of at least 30 days' worth) and streamlining the regulatory processes for new power projects.", "normalised": "What can be done?
