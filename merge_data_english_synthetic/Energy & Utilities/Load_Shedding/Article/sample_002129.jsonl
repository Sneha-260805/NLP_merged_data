Think of it like this: imagine your building only has enough biryani to feed half the residents. Rationing it out is kinda like load shedding. They do it to prevent the whole system from collapsing when demand is much higher than supply."}

Well, blame it on a combination of factors. Firstly, the infrastructure, especially in older cities, isn’t always up to the mark. Some lines are still carrying more load than they were designed for, leading to frequent breakdowns. Secondly, demand skyrockets in the summer – everyone cranking up their A C s, coolers, and refrigerators, all at once. It's like a constant power struggle for energy."}

We are kinda doing that, but on a national scale. It’s a slow process, but hopefully, someday load shedding will be a thing of the past and we can watch uninterrupted cricket matches with the A C blasting! Until then, keep your inverters charged, folks! And maybe learn a few old-school board games to pass the time."}
