{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, put simply, is when the electricity company – like, say, Tata Power in Mumbai or maybe the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited back home – deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing. Think of it like this: the demand for electricity exceeds the supply. So, instead of the whole system crashing (imagine all of Delhi plunging into darkness!), they strategically shut down parts of it.", "normalised": "Load shedding, put simply, is when the electricity company – like, say, Tata Power in Mumbai or maybe the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited back home – deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing.

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, there are a bunch of reasons. Sometimes it's because the power plants aren't generating enough electricity. Maybe there's a shortage of coal, or maybe a major power plant, like the one at Singrauli, is undergoing maintenance. Other times, it's because the infrastructure is old and can't handle the peak demand. Imagine those old, overloaded transformers humming and sparking – they're just begging for a break.", "normalised": "Why does this happen? Well, there are a bunch of reasons.

{"unnormalised": "Living through load shedding can be a pain. You need to charge your phones and power banks religiously. Inverters become your best friend.
