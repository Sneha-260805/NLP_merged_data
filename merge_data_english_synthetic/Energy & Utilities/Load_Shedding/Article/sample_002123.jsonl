{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are multifaceted. Industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in places like Coimbatore and Ludhiana, often face substantial production losses, requiring them to invest in expensive backup generators powered by diesel, adding to their operational costs and environmental footprint. Businesses relying on uninterrupted power, such as IT companies in Bengaluru and hospitals in Chennai, suffer significant disruptions.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "For households, load shedding disrupts daily routines, impacting everything from cooking meals (imagine trying to cook a complicated biryani during a power outage) to studying and accessing essential services like water supply, which often relies on electric pumps. In rural areas, the lack of electricity can severely hinder agricultural activities, impacting irrigation and post-harvest processing.", "normalised": "For households, load shedding disrupts daily routines, impacting everything from cooking meals (imagine trying to cook a complicated biryani during a power outage) to studying and accessing essential services like water supply, which often relies on electric pumps.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing the issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, significant investment is needed to upgrade and expand the power transmission and distribution infrastructure. Many existing lines are old and prone to breakdowns, leading to frequent outages even without deliberate load shedding. Smart grids, which allow for more efficient monitoring and management of power flow, are crucial.", "normalised": "Addressing the issue requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, demand-side management strategies are essential. Promoting energy efficiency through public awareness campaigns and incentivizing the adoption of energy-efficient appliances can significantly reduce peak demand. Time-of-day pricing, where electricity tariffs are higher during peak hours, can also encourage consumers to shift their energy consumption patterns.", "normalised": "Secondly, demand-side management strategies are essential.

While India has made commendable progress in renewable energy, diversifying the energy sources, including nuclear and hydropower, and ensuring a stable base load power supply is critical. The establishment of new power plants, like the proposed 4000 MW Yadadri Ultra Mega Power Project in Telangana, is vital to meet growing energy demands.", "normalised": "Thirdly, enhancing the generation capacity mix is important. While India has made commendable progress in renewable energy, diversifying the energy sources, including nuclear and hydropower, and ensuring a stable base load power supply is critical. The establishment of new power plants, like the proposed four thousand M W Yadadri Ultra Mega Power Project in Telangana, is vital to meet growing energy demands."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, stricter regulatory oversight and improved coordination between different state electricity boards (SEBs) are crucial. The financial health of many SEBs remains a concern, hindering their ability to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Addressing these financial challenges and fostering greater cooperation between states is essential to ensure a reliable and sustainable power supply for all, reducing the need for frequent and disruptive load shedding. A family celebration during Onam shouldn't be overshadowed by a power cut. The situation demands immediate and sustained attention from policymakers and stakeholders alike.", "normalised": "Finally, stricter regulatory oversight and improved coordination between different state electricity boards (S E B s) are crucial.
