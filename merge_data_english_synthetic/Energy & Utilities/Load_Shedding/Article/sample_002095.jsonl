How many times this week have you been plunged into darkness thanks to load shedding? If you are anything like my family in Lucknow, it is probably enough to make you want to switch to candles and become a modern day Mahatma Gandhi. But before we ditch our appliances, let us break down this frustrating phenomenon."}

Why? Well, usually it is because the demand for electricity is higher than what the power grid can handle. Think peak summer months when everyone's A C is blasting at full speed, or during Diwali when the whole nation is lit up brighter than a Bollywood premiere remember that scene in \"Om Shanti Om\"? So much light!"}

Sometimes it is because of old, creaky infrastructure that is overdue for an upgrade. Imagine an electricity grid like your grandfather's old scooter – it works, but not always reliably! Other times, it could be due to a shortage of coal or other fuels needed to power the power plants. And, of course, there is always the ever present possibility of technical issues – a blown transformer here, a damaged cable there."}
