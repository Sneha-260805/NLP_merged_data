{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding. Inadequate generation capacity, especially during peak demand periods such as the summer months of April and May, puts immense strain on the existing infrastructure. Aging transmission and distribution networks, characterized by high transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, further exacerbate the problem. These losses, often exceeding 20% in some states, represent a significant waste of generated power.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "Coal shortages, a recurring problem, also play a critical role. Thermal power plants, which form the backbone of India's electricity generation, rely heavily on coal. Disruptions in coal supply, often due to logistical bottlenecks or labour disputes, lead to reduced power generation, necessitating load shedding. The coal crisis of October 2021, for instance, resulted in widespread power outages across the country.", "normalised": "Coal shortages, a recurring problem, also play a critical role.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, inefficient demand-side management contributes to the problem. A lack of awareness about energy conservation practices among consumers, coupled with the absence of effective incentives for reducing peak demand, adds to the overall pressure on the grid. Often, residential areas in Delhi face scheduled power cuts from 14:00 hrs to 17:00 hrs during peak summers.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inefficient demand-side management contributes to the problem.

{"unnormalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), suffer significant losses due to disrupted production schedules. Agricultural activities are also hampered, affecting irrigation and other essential farming operations.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing the issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Increased investment in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is crucial to diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Modernization of the transmission and distribution infrastructure, with the deployment of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), is essential to reduce T&D losses and improve grid stability.", "normalised": "Addressing the issue requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Effective demand-side management strategies, including time-of-use tariffs and public awareness campaigns, can help shift demand away from peak hours. The UDAY scheme, launched in 2015, aimed to improve the financial health of state-owned distribution companies (Discoms), but its success has been mixed. The financial burden on Discoms often leads to deferred maintenance and underinvestment in infrastructure, perpetuating the cycle of unreliable power supply.", "normalised": "Effective demand-side management strategies, including time-of-use tariffs and public awareness campaigns, can help shift demand away from peak hours.

Reducing load shedding is not just an energy issue; it is a fundamental requirement for economic growth and social development. The recent budget allocated Rs. 1.97 lakh crore for the power sector, signaling a renewed focus on addressing these challenges.", "normalised": "Ultimately, ensuring reliable and affordable power for all Indians, a vision enshrined in the Electricity Act, two thousand and three, requires sustained commitment and coordinated efforts from both the central and state governments, as well as active participation from consumers.
