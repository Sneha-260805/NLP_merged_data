It's basically a polite way of saying \"power cut,\" but it sounds a bit more planned, right?

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen, you ask? Well, think of it like this: demand for electricity is like that massive wedding feast you see in Bollywood films – remember the Ambani wedding scenes? Everyone’s piling their plates high! If the supply (the amount of food cooked) isn't enough, things get messy. Similarly, if the electricity generation and distribution aren't keeping up with demand, especially during peak usage times, the utility company has to intentionally cut off power to certain areas to prevent a complete system failure. Think of it as rationing the rasgullas so everyone gets *something*.", "normalised": "Why does this happen, you ask?

The problem is a complex one involving growing demand, aging infrastructure, and the challenges of transitioning to cleaner energy sources. Hopefully, with continued investment in infrastructure and a greater focus on sustainable energy, we'll see less of this unscheduled darkness in the future.
