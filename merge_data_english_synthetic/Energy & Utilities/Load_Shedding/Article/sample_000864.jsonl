{"unnormalised": "One of the primary causes is the mismatch between electricity supply and demand. During peak hours, particularly in the summer months (April-June), demand for electricity surges due to increased use of air conditioning and irrigation pumps, especially in agricultural states like Punjab and Haryana. If the available power generation and transmission capacity cannot meet this peak demand, load shedding becomes inevitable to prevent a complete grid collapse. Instances of demand exceeding supply by a significant margin were observed in Rajasthan as recently as May 2023.", "normalised": "One of the primary causes is the mismatch between electricity supply and demand.

{"unnormalised": "Another contributing factor is inadequate transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure. Old and overloaded power lines, coupled with inefficient transformers, result in substantial transmission losses. These losses can reach upwards of 20% in some states, effectively reducing the amount of electricity available for consumption. Furthermore, theft and illegal connections, particularly in densely populated urban areas and remote villages, exacerbate the problem. Upgrading this ageing infrastructure requires substantial investment and long-term planning. The Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) is currently undertaking several projects to strengthen the national grid, but progress is often slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and land acquisition challenges.", "normalised": "Another contributing factor is inadequate transmission and distribution T and D infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of load shedding is considerable. Industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in towns like Kanpur and Surat, face significant disruptions to their production processes, leading to reduced output and financial losses. Farmers, reliant on electricity for irrigation, suffer crop damage when power outages coincide with critical watering schedules. Households also experience inconvenience and discomfort, impacting productivity and quality of life. The situation is particularly acute during important festivals like Diwali, when heightened energy consumption further strains the grid. Remember the massive blackout on 31/07/2012 that impacted millions across northern India?", "normalised": "The economic impact of load shedding is considerable.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes increasing power generation capacity from renewable sources such as solar and wind, improving energy efficiency through demand-side management programs, and investing in smart grid technologies to enhance grid resilience and reduce transmission losses. Furthermore, stricter enforcement against electricity theft and improved metering are crucial. The government's ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 aims to reduce India's reliance on fossil fuels and diversify its energy sources. Implementation of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) is another positive step towards modernizing distribution infrastructure.", "normalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach.
