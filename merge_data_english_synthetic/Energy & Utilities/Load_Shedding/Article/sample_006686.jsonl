{"unnormalised": "One of the primary drivers of load shedding is the supply-demand mismatch, especially during peak hours. In the scorching summer months, when temperatures soar in cities like Delhi and Jaipur, the demand for electricity to power air conditioners and cooling systems overwhelms the existing infrastructure. This often leads to localized outages, implemented to prevent a total grid collapse. Aging infrastructure, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas, further exacerbates the problem. Transmission and distribution losses, often exceeding 20% in some states, contribute significantly to the overall inefficiency.", "normalised": "One of the primary drivers of load shedding is the supply-demand mismatch, especially during peak hours.

{"unnormalised": "The socio-economic repercussions of load shedding are widespread. Businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in sectors like textiles in Surat or manufacturing units in Ludhiana, face significant productivity losses. Frequent power disruptions can halt production lines, damage sensitive equipment, and increase operational costs due to the reliance on diesel generators. For households, load shedding disrupts daily routines, impacts access to essential services like water supply (dependent on electric pumps), and affects studies of students preparing for crucial exams like the IIT-JEE or NEET. Imagine the frustration of a family in Patna experiencing a power cut at 19:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, just as they were settling down to watch the Republic Day parade.", "normalised": "The socio-economic repercussions of load shedding are widespread.

{"unnormalised": "Efforts to address load shedding have focused on increasing power generation capacity, improving transmission infrastructure, and promoting energy efficiency. The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, aimed at rural electrification, has undoubtedly expanded access to electricity, but reliable supply remains a challenge. Initiatives promoting the adoption of energy-efficient appliances, like LED bulbs and BEE-rated refrigerators, have shown some promise in curbing peak demand. Moreover, the increasing deployment of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is gradually diversifying the energy mix, reducing reliance on conventional fossil fuels. The commissioning of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant has also augmented power generation in the southern grid.", "normalised": "Efforts to address load shedding have focused on increasing power generation capacity, improving transmission infrastructure, and promoting energy efficiency.

State Electricity Boards (SEBs), often burdened by debt and inefficiency, struggle to provide reliable and affordable power to consumers.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, smart grid technologies, demand-side management strategies, and decentralized power generation models offer promising avenues for mitigating load shedding. For example, rooftop solar installations coupled with battery storage can provide a reliable power source for households and businesses, reducing dependence on the grid. Effective policy interventions, coupled with technological innovation, are essential to ensure a stable and reliable power supply for all citizens of India, preventing scenarios like the unscheduled power cuts that plagued Kanpur on 15/08/2023, despite being Independence Day. Investing Rs. 5000 crores in grid upgrades by 2025 is estimated to reduce load shedding by 15% in Uttar Pradesh alone, according to a recent report by IIT Kanpur. Furthermore, efficient energy management practices can lower energy consumption by 10-15% during peak hours (14:00-17:00 hrs) significantly decreasing the need for load shedding.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, smart grid technologies, demand-side management strategies, and decentralized power generation models offer promising avenues for mitigating load shedding.
