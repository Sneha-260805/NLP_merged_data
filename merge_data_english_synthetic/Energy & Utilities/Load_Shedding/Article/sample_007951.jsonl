{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding. These include insufficient generation capacity, particularly during peak demand hours like summer afternoons and evenings, and inadequate transmission and distribution infrastructure. Aging infrastructure often leads to frequent breakdowns and power losses, exacerbating the problem. Additionally, coal shortages, a significant fuel source for thermal power plants in India, can disrupt electricity generation. For example, in the summer of 2022, many states, including Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, faced prolonged power cuts due to dwindling coal reserves.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of load shedding is considerable. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), suffer significant losses due to production disruptions. Businesses relying on continuous power supply, such as hospitals and data centers, are severely affected. Furthermore, prolonged power outages can disrupt daily life, impacting household activities, education, and access to essential services. Think of a family trying to prepare a celebratory biryani for Eid, only to have the power cut out midway.", "normalised": "The economic impact of load shedding is considerable.

{"unnormalised": "The government and DISCOMs are taking steps to address the issue. These include investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, upgrading transmission and distribution networks through initiatives like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), and promoting energy efficiency through measures like the UJALA scheme, which distributes LED bulbs at subsidized rates. Smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) are also being deployed to better manage demand and reduce losses.", "normalised": "The government and D I S C O M s are taking steps to address the issue.

{"unnormalised": "However, overcoming the challenge of load shedding requires sustained effort and a multi-pronged approach. Further investments in generation capacity, particularly in clean energy sources, are crucial. Improving the financial health of DISCOMs is also essential to enable them to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Stricter enforcement of energy conservation measures and public awareness campaigns can help reduce demand.", "normalised": "However, overcoming the challenge of load shedding requires sustained effort and a multi-pronged approach.
