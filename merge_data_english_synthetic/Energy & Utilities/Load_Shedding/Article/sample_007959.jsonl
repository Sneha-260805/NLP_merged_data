{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, or planned power outages, remains a significant challenge within India's energy and utilities landscape. Despite substantial progress in electrification, many regions, particularly in rural areas and during peak demand seasons, still grapple with intermittent power supply. This practice, implemented to prevent the collapse of the electricity grid due to over demand, disproportionately impacts businesses, households, and critical infrastructure.", "normalised": "Load shedding, or planned power outages, remains a significant challenge within India's energy and utilities landscape.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the persistence of load shedding. Inadequate infrastructure, including outdated transmission lines and insufficient generation capacity, is a primary concern. For instance, the northern grid collapse of 2012, which affected over 600 million people, highlighted the fragility of the national power transmission network. Furthermore, delays in commissioning new power plants, often due to land acquisition issues and environmental clearances, exacerbate the problem. Projects worth Rs. 50,000 crore are reportedly stalled due to these issues in the state of Maharashtra alone.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the persistence of load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "The reliance on coal-fired power plants, while providing a stable baseload, also presents challenges. Coal shortages, transportation bottlenecks, and environmental regulations can disrupt power generation, leading to unscheduled load shedding. The increasing demand for electricity, driven by economic growth and rising living standards, further strains the existing infrastructure. Peak demand during the summer months, when temperatures soar above 45 degrees Celsius in states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, often necessitates load shedding to prevent grid overload.", "normalised": "The reliance on coal-fired power plants, while providing a stable baseload, also presents challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding is far-reaching. Businesses face production losses, increased costs due to reliance on backup generators, and reduced competitiveness. Households experience inconvenience, disruptions to daily routines, and potential damage to electrical appliances. Critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and water treatment plants, is particularly vulnerable to power outages, posing risks to public health and safety. In Chennai, for example, hospitals often rely on diesel generators, adding to operational expenses.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding is far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Efforts are underway to address the issue. The government's focus on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, aims to diversify the energy mix and reduce dependence on coal. Investments in grid modernization, including the deployment of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure, are crucial for improving grid stability and reducing transmission losses. Initiatives like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) target strengthening sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas.", "normalised": "Efforts are underway to address the issue.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring the timely completion of infrastructure projects, streamlining regulatory processes, and promoting energy efficiency are essential for mitigating the impact of load shedding. Moreover, promoting awareness among consumers about energy conservation practices can help reduce peak demand. Many families forego cooking elaborate meals during periods of anticipated load shedding, opting instead for simpler fare like idli or quick curries. Even during festive occasions like Onam in Kerala, families sometimes adjust their celebrations to accommodate scheduled power cuts. Resolving this issue is critical for ensuring sustained economic growth and improving the quality of life for millions of Indians. A 10 km stretch might be required to electrify a remote village in Arunachal Pradesh, needing significant investment and resources to do so.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
