Think of it like this: your electricity company, say Tata Power in Mumbai, has a limited amount of electricity to distribute. If everyone starts blasting their ACs and using all their appliances at the same time, the system gets overloaded, and they have to deliberately cut off power to certain areas to prevent a total blackout. It's like a forced digital detox, whether you want it or not.", "normalised": "Basically, load shedding happens when the electricity supply isn’t enough to meet the demand.
