{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Let's talk about something we Indians know all too well: load shedding. Or, as some of us dramatically call it, the bane of our existence! Basically, it's when the power company decides to switch off electricity in certain areas for a while. Sounds inconvenient? You betcha.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, the main reason is usually that the demand for electricity is higher than what the power grid can supply. Think of it like trying to squeeze too much biryani into one bowl – something's gotta give. Especially during the scorching summers in places like Delhi or Uttar Pradesh, everyone's AC is blasting, and the grid buckles under the pressure. Sometimes, it's also due to maintenance work or faults in the transmission lines. Remember that time the entire neighborhood in Andheri, Mumbai was dark because a transformer blew? Good times, good times.", "normalised": "Why does this happen? Well, the main reason is usually that the demand for electricity is higher than what the power grid can supply.

Or you're watching the latest episode of your favorite show (maybe something with Amitabh Bachchan?), and suddenly the screen goes blank. And don't even get me started on trying to cook dinner – no pressure cooker when the power is out! It's particularly annoying during festivals, like trying to celebrate Onam in Kerala with no lights. It’s almost as if the universe is conspiring against you enjoying that delicious sadhya.", "normalised": "Load shedding can seriously mess with your day.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, load shedding impacts businesses too. Small shopkeepers in places like Kolkata rely on electricity for their lights, fans, and to run their cash registers. If the power goes out for a few hours every day, it can seriously affect their earnings. Even big companies have to deal with it, often relying on expensive generators to keep things running.", "normalised": "Of course, load shedding impacts businesses too.

{"unnormalised": "What's the solution? Well, India's working on improving its electricity infrastructure. More power plants are being built, and there's a big push towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. It's a slow process, but hopefully, one day we'll be able to say goodbye to load shedding for good. Until then, maybe it's time to invest in a good power bank and a couple of candles. And maybe learn to cook by candlelight! Because in India, you just never know when the lights will go out. Let’s hope Adani or Tata Power figure this out sooner rather than later! And seriously, someone needs to invent a solar-powered ceiling fan that actually works. I'd pay Rs. 5000 for one of those, easy. My neighbor Suresh in Bangalore would probably pay Rs. 10,000. We're desperate!", "normalised": "What's the solution? Well, India's working on improving its electricity infrastructure.
