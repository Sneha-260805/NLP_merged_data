{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, also known as planned power outages, remains a persistent challenge in the Indian energy and utilities sector. Despite significant advancements in electricity generation capacity, many regions across the country continue to experience scheduled interruptions in power supply. This phenomenon, often exacerbated during peak demand seasons like the scorching summer months and festive occasions, impacts businesses, households, and essential services alike.", "normalised": "Load shedding, also known as planned power outages, remains a persistent challenge in the Indian energy and utilities sector.

{"unnormalised": "The underlying causes of load shedding are multifaceted. Inadequate infrastructure, including aging transmission and distribution networks, contributes significantly. Transmission losses, particularly in certain states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, remain alarmingly high, leading to a disparity between the power generated and the power ultimately delivered to consumers. Furthermore, insufficient generation capacity, especially during peak hours between 18:00 hrs and 22:00 hrs, forces distribution companies to implement load shedding to prevent grid instability and potential blackouts.", "normalised": "The underlying causes of load shedding are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of frequent power outages are far-reaching. Industries, from SMEs in places like Moradabad to large-scale manufacturing units in industrial hubs near Chennai, face production losses and increased operational costs due to reliance on expensive backup generators. Students preparing for crucial exams, like the IIT-JEE, face disruption in their studies. Healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas reliant on uninterrupted power for critical equipment, are put at risk. The economic impact is substantial, estimated to be in the thousands of crores annually, hindering India’s growth trajectory.", "normalised": "The consequences of frequent power outages are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Government initiatives like the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (now subsumed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana) have aimed to improve rural electrification and reduce transmission losses. However, challenges persist in ensuring reliable and affordable power supply, particularly in remote and underserved areas. The integration of renewable energy sources, like solar power from projects in Rajasthan, offers a promising avenue for increasing generation capacity and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, intermittency and grid integration issues need to be addressed effectively.", "normalised": "Government initiatives like the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (now subsumed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana) have aimed to improve rural electrification and reduce transmission losses.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, a multi-pronged approach is crucial to mitigating load shedding. This includes significant investments in upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure, promoting energy efficiency measures among consumers, strengthening grid management capabilities, and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy technologies. Policy reforms aimed at attracting private sector participation and promoting competition in the electricity distribution sector are also essential. The promise made by Prime Minister Nehru on 15/08/1947, for a brighter future, includes access to reliable power for all Indians.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, a multi-pronged approach is crucial to mitigating load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "Specific instances of load shedding impacting exam schedules were reported in Delhi during the month of May in 2023. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has often announced scheduled load shedding affecting villages across the state during peak agricultural seasons to manage power demand for irrigation. The situation demands urgent and sustained attention to ensure a reliable and affordable power supply for all, propelling India towards its ambitious economic and developmental goals by 2047.", "normalised": "Specific instances of load shedding impacting exam schedules were reported in Delhi during the month of May in two thousand and twenty three.
