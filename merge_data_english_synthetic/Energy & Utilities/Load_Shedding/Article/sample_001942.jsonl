{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, or scheduled power cuts, is basically when the electricity company, like maybe Tata Power or Adani Electricity in some areas, deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas for a specific period. Why do they do this? Well, usually it’s because the demand for electricity is higher than what they can supply. Think everyone cranking up their ACs to beat the heat, or industries running full throttle. The grid can't handle the strain, so they have to shed some load to prevent a total blackout, which would be way worse! Imagine Onam celebrations without the festive lights – disastrous!", "normalised": "Load shedding, or scheduled power cuts, is basically when the electricity company, like maybe Tata Power or Adani Electricity in some areas, deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas for a specific period.

{"unnormalised": "Back in the day, remember when load shedding was a constant companion? You'd know the schedule better than your daily bus timings! These days, it's thankfully less frequent in many urban areas thanks to increased power generation and better infrastructure. However, in some rural areas, especially during peak agricultural season when farmers need to power their irrigation pumps, load shedding can still be a major headache.", "normalised": "Back in the day, remember when load shedding was a constant companion?

{"unnormalised": "The impact can be pretty significant. Businesses, especially small ones, suffer because they can't operate properly. Think of the poor chaat wala trying to keep his fridge running! Students preparing for exams have to study by candlelight (talk about old school!).

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are solutions. Investing in renewable energy sources like solar power is a big one. Improving the efficiency of our power grids and reducing transmission losses is also crucial. And let's not forget, we can all do our part by conserving energy – switching off lights when we leave a room, using energy-efficient appliances, and maybe not cranking the AC down to 16 degrees Celsius!", "normalised": "Of course, there are solutions.

{"unnormalised": "The government has schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) to improve power infrastructure. Hopefully, these initiatives will help reduce load shedding in the future. But until then, keep a power bank handy, charge your phone, and maybe invest in a good old-fashioned lantern. You never know when the lights might go out again in Lucknow… or anywhere else in India for that matter. And for goodness sake, eat that biryani quickly before it gets cold! It’s too good to waste.", "normalised": "The government has schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (I P D S) to improve power infrastructure.
