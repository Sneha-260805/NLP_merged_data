{"unnormalised": "Hey folks, let's talk about something that's probably made all of us in India groan at least once this week: load shedding! Yep, that lovely phenomenon where the power company, usually the local electricity board (like BESCOM in Bangalore or MSEB in Maharashtra), decides to, well, shed the load. Basically, it means planned power cuts.", "normalised": "Hey folks, let's talk about something that's probably made all of us in India groan at least once this week: load shedding!

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, a bunch of reasons. Sometimes, it's because demand is just too high, especially during those scorching summer months in Delhi when everyone's AC is blasting. Other times, it’s due to maintenance on the power grid – gotta keep those transformers humming, right? And let’s not forget unexpected breakdowns! Remember that time the grid tripped after that crazy monsoon storm in Chennai? Total chaos!", "normalised": "Why does this happen? Well, a bunch of reasons.

{"unnormalised": "The impact? Massive inconvenience, obviously. For students cramming for exams, like little Rohan prepping for his IIT entrance, it's a nightmare. Businesses suffer too. Imagine trying to run a call center in Gurgaon during a two-hour power outage. Productivity grinds to a halt. Small businesses, especially, feel the pinch. Remember aunty Sheila's sari shop in Chandni Chowk? She had to shut down early one day because of a power cut, losing potential Rs. 5000 in sales!", "normalised": "The impact?

{"unnormalised": "What's the solution? Well, that's the million-dollar question, isn’t it? Investing in renewable energy sources like solar power is a big one. Dr. Kalam, bless his soul, always advocated for energy independence. Upgrading the existing infrastructure is crucial, too. No point having fancy new wind farms if the old transmission lines can't handle the extra juice. Smart grids are also a great idea – they can automatically balance the load and prevent widespread outages.", "normalised": "What's the solution? Well, that's the million-dollar question, isn’t it?

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, dealing with load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach: better planning, infrastructure investment, and a shift towards sustainable energy. Maybe one day we won't have to experience this disruption, but until then, invest in a good UPS and keep those candles handy, just in case! Let's hope that the government can prioritize this and makes our lives a little easier.", "normalised": "Ultimately, dealing with load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach: better planning, infrastructure investment, and a shift towards sustainable energy.
