We’ve all been there, right? You're watching your favorite cricket match, maybe India is playing Pakistan and Virat Kohli is about to smash a six, and BAM! Darkness. Total blackout.

Why, you ask? Usually, it’s because the demand for electricity is higher than what they can supply. Think about it: everyone in Lucknow turns on their A C on a hot day in June – that’s a huge strain on the system."}

Sometimes it’s outdated infrastructure – like old power plants running on fumes or inefficient transmission lines. Sometimes it's just a lack of investment in new power generation.

Well, investing in renewable energy sources like solar power is a big one. Imagine entire villages powered by solar panels – no more dependence on the grid! Improving energy efficiency is also key.
