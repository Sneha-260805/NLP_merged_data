Imagine trying to squeeze all of Mumbai's commuters onto a single local train during rush hour – things get crowded, and someone's getting left behind. Similarly, when everyone's blasting their A C's, charging their phones, and running their factories all at once, the power grid can get overloaded, causing blackouts."}

Well, India's energy infrastructure, while improving, is still playing catch-up. We're a nation of over one point four billion people, and everyone wants their share of the power. Plus, factors like aging power plants, inefficient distribution networks, and even something as simple as unusually hot weather can all contribute. Remember that heatwave last May? Load shedding was practically a daily ritual."}

Businesses, especially small ones in places like Kanpur, suffer because they can't run their machines or keep their shops open.

It's the kind of shared trauma that binds us as a nation, really."}

We need more investment, better planning, and a greater commitment to sustainable energy practices.
