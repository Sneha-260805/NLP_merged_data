Or, as my Nani in Kolkata used to call it, \"power cut\" – simpler times, eh?", "normalised": "So, what’s the deal? Basically, it's when the power company, like maybe B E S C O M in Bangalore or Tata Power in Mumbai, deliberately cuts off electricity supply to certain areas for a specific time. They do this when the demand for electricity (everyone blasting their A C s in Chennai during peak summer, for instance) is higher than what they can supply. Think of it like trying to squeeze too much water through a pipe – things gotta give!"}

Can't run your machines, can't keep the lights on, can't keep the computers running – it all adds up to lost income and productivity. Even schools and hospitals are affected. Imagine a surgeon trying to perform a critical operation in A I I M S, Delhi, and B A M! Power cut. Scary stuff."}

Sometimes it's because of old and creaky infrastructure – transformers blowing up, transmission lines getting overloaded, the works. Other times, it’s because of a lack of sufficient power generation capacity. Maybe the coal supply to the power plants is delayed, or the hydroelectric dams aren’t getting enough water because of a poor monsoon. And sometimes, let’s be honest, it’s just plain old mismanagement."}

So what can you do? Invest in an inverter, maybe a small generator if you can afford it. Get a solar charger for your phone. And most importantly, be mindful of your electricity consumption. Turn off lights when you leave a room, use energy-efficient appliances, and try not to blast the A C all day long. Every little bit helps! It's not just about saving money on your rupee three thousand electricity bill, it's about doing your part to ease the load on the system. We gotta remember, we're all in this together, from Kerala to Kashmir! And maybe, just maybe, we can finally enjoy a power-cut free Onam next year!"}
