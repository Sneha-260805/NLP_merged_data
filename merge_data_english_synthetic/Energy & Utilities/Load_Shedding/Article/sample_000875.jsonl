{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, also known as planned power outages, remains a significant impediment to India's economic progress and the well-being of its citizens. Despite substantial investments in power generation and transmission infrastructure, many regions across the country continue to grapple with this disruptive practice. The underlying causes are multifaceted, ranging from inadequate infrastructure and transmission bottlenecks to escalating energy demand and inefficient distribution systems.", "normalised": "Load shedding, also known as planned power outages, remains a significant impediment to India's economic progress and the well-being of its citizens.

{"unnormalised": "For instance, in the scorching summer months, states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh often experience peak demand exceeding supply capacity, leading to scheduled blackouts. In rural areas, the situation is often exacerbated by poor grid connectivity and widespread electricity theft, necessitating longer and more frequent periods of load shedding. Agricultural activities, heavily reliant on electricity for irrigation pumps, are particularly vulnerable. Imagine a farmer in Maharashtra, relying on his borewell to irrigate his sugarcane fields, only to face a sudden power cut at 14:00 hrs, jeopardizing his entire crop. Such instances highlight the real-world impact of this persistent problem.", "normalised": "For instance, in the scorching summer months, states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh often experience peak demand exceeding supply capacity, leading to scheduled blackouts.

{"unnormalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial. Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in industrial hubs like Coimbatore and Ludhiana, suffer productivity losses due to disrupted operations. Reliance on diesel generators as backup power sources adds significantly to operational costs, impacting profitability and competitiveness. Furthermore, frequent power outages can deter foreign investment and hinder economic growth.", "normalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial.

{"unnormalised": "Efforts to address load shedding are ongoing, driven by initiatives such as the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). These programs aim to strengthen power distribution infrastructure, reduce transmission losses, and improve access to electricity, particularly in rural areas. Smart grid technologies and renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are also being actively promoted to diversify the energy mix and enhance grid stability. The Ministry of Power has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity addition, aiming to reach 500 GW by 2030.", "normalised": "Efforts to address load shedding are ongoing, driven by initiatives such as the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (D D U G J Y) and the Integrated Power Development Scheme (I P D S).

{"unnormalised": "However, significant challenges remain. The financial health of many State Electricity Boards (SEBs) is precarious, burdened by accumulated losses and inefficiencies. Timely tariff revisions and improved revenue collection are crucial to ensure the financial viability of these utilities and enable them to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Furthermore, effective coordination between central and state governments is essential to ensure the successful implementation of power sector reforms.", "normalised": "However, significant challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "On the date of 26/01/1950, India adopted its constitution, a symbolic commitment to progress. Addressing load shedding decisively is crucial to fulfilling that promise, ensuring reliable and affordable electricity for all citizens. Power cuts in cities like Patna at 19:30 hrs during peak hours are simply unacceptable in a nation aspiring to be a global economic power. Furthermore, the reliance on old coal plants contributes significantly to pollution. Upgrading these plants or transitioning to cleaner energy sources is a necessity. A presentation by IIT Delhi on new energy efficient grids is scheduled for 10/11/2024. A concerted and sustained effort from all stakeholders is needed to finally eliminate this persistent obstacle to India's development. The estimated cost of power outages to the Indian economy is Rs. 1.5 lakh crore annually.", "normalised": "On the date of twenty sixth January nineteen fifty, India adopted its constitution, a symbolic commitment to progress.
