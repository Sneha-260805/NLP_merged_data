It's basically when the power company, like, Tata Power or BSES, decides to cut off electricity to certain areas to prevent the whole system from crashing. Imagine your neighborhood suddenly plunging into darkness – that's load shedding in action.", "normalised": "Alright, folks, let's talk load shedding.

Think of it like this: everyone's blasting their ACs to escape the 45 degrees Celsius heat, factories are churning out goods non-stop, and suddenly the grid goes, \"Nope, I can't handle this anymore!\" Boom, lights out.", "normalised": "Why does this happen, you ask?

{"unnormalised": "There are solutions, of course. Investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can help diversify our energy supply and reduce our reliance on coal-fired power plants. Smart grids that can better manage electricity distribution are also key. And, let’s be honest, responsible electricity consumption on our part can make a difference too. Maybe we don't need to keep the AC running at 16 degrees all the time, eh?", "normalised": "There are solutions, of course.
