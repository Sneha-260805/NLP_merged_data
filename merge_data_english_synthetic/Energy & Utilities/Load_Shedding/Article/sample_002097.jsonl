{"unnormalised": "Essentially, load shedding, or as some politely call it, \"planned outages,\" is when the power company, like maybe Tata Power or Reliance Energy, intentionally cuts off electricity supply to certain areas. Why? Well, usually it's because demand for electricity is exceeding what they can supply. Think of it like trying to pour too much water through a pipe; eventually, something’s gotta give. And in this case, the \"something\" is your power supply.", "normalised": "Essentially, load shedding, or as some politely call it, \"planned outages,\" is when the power company, like maybe Tata Power or Reliance Energy, intentionally cuts off electricity supply to certain areas.

{"unnormalised": "The reasons for load shedding can be varied. Sometimes it’s a problem with the infrastructure – outdated power grids that just can't handle the load. Other times it's due to fuel shortages for power plants, or even transmission issues across long distances, like getting power from a hydro plant in the Himalayas all the way down to, say, Hyderabad. Then there are unexpected things, like a transformer blowing out near your colony and causing a chain reaction.", "normalised": "The reasons for load shedding can be varied.
