{"unnormalised": "Okay, so what's the deal with load shedding? Seriously, between prepping for Onam Sadhya and binge-watching \"Panchayat\" on Amazon Prime, the lights deciding to take a nap is the last thing anyone in Kerala wants. Load shedding, or as some folks dramatically call it, \"power cuts,\" is basically a planned interruption of electricity supply to avoid overloading the grid. Think of it like this: the power company, say, Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), has to juggle the amount of electricity available with the amount people are using. When demand exceeds supply, especially during peak hours (like when everyone’s running their ACs in May or frying appams for Onam), they have to cut off power to certain areas to prevent a total system collapse. Imagine the entire state going dark! Chaos, right?", "normalised": "Okay, so what is the deal with load shedding?

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, a bunch of reasons. Sometimes it's due to a shortage of generation capacity. Maybe the hydro-electric dams aren't producing enough because of a poor monsoon, or a coal plant is facing maintenance issues. Other times, it's about transmission bottlenecks. The power might be generated, but getting it from the generating station in, say, Neyveli, to your home in Kochi involves navigating a network of transmission lines. If those lines are old or overloaded, they can trip, causing outages.", "normalised": "Why does this happen? Well, a bunch of reasons. Sometimes it is due to a shortage of generation capacity.

KSEB is working on upgrading this, of course, but it's a massive task that will take time and a lot of Rs. crores. Plus, the growing population and increasing reliance on electricity – everyone wants their phones charged, their TVs on, and their biryani warm in the microwave – only adds to the pressure.", "normalised": "And let us not forget the good old infrastructure problems.

{"unnormalised": "Load shedding can really mess with your plans. Forget working from home, say goodbye to Netflix, and suddenly, your perfectly planned Onam feast is cooking on a gas stove in the dark. Businesses, too, suffer.

It's not just a minor inconvenience; it can have a real economic impact, especially for small businesses in towns like Kozhikode.", "normalised": "Load shedding can really mess with your plans.

{"unnormalised": "What can you do? Well, be mindful of your electricity usage. Switch off lights when you leave a room, use energy-efficient appliances, and consider investing in a UPS or inverter if you’re prone to frequent outages. Also, keep an eye on KSEB's announcements regarding load shedding schedules. They usually publish these in newspapers and on their website. Knowledge is power, literally! And who knows, maybe one day, we'll have enough renewable energy and smart grids that load shedding becomes a thing of the past. Until then, keep a candle handy and maybe learn to make biryani on a chulha, just in case! A 20 km black out happened last year in Ernakulam.", "normalised": "What can you do?
