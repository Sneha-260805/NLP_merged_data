When demand exceeds the available power supply – especially during peak hours like those sweltering afternoons when everyone's A C is blasting – the electricity distribution companies (Discoms) have to resort to load shedding to prevent a complete system collapse. Think of it like a pressure valve; better to let a little steam out than have the whole cooker explode."}

Turn off lights when you leave a room, use energy-efficient appliances (those B E E five-star rated ones), and maybe even invest in a small inverter for those crucial moments. Every little bit helps.
