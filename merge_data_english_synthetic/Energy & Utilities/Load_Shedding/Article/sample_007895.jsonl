It is that time again, isn't it? Just when you're settled down to watch your favourite episode of \"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah,\" BOOM! Darkness.

Basically, it is a fancy term for a planned power outage. See, our electricity grid, especially in some states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, sometimes can't handle the peak demand. Everyone switches on their A C s, coolers, and T V s at the same time, and the grid goes thud. To prevent a complete blackout – picture a whole city going dark, like something out of a dramatic Bollywood film – the power company, like, say, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), deliberately cuts off power to certain areas for a certain period."}

Especially in places like Delhi or Mumbai where everything is so fast-paced. Imagine trying to meet a deadline for your office work when the power suddenly cuts out at two P M! Or trying to cook a proper dinner for the family when the lights go out, and you're left with just a flickering candle. Chai gets cold, the ceiling fan stops, and the inverter starts making that irritating buzzing sound."}
