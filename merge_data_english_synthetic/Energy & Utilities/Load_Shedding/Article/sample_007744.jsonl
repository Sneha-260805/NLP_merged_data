{"unnormalised": "The reasons behind it are numerous. Old and creaky infrastructure plays a big part. Imagine trying to run a marathon in chappals – that's kind of what our power grid is sometimes like. Lack of investment in new power plants, distribution losses (electricity disappearing along the way – think of it as leakage in a water pipe), and even things like coal shortages contribute.
