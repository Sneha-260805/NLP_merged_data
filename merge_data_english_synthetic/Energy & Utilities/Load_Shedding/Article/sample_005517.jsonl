They’ll often rotate the outages, so everyone gets a fair share of darkness (and light!).

Until we have enough biryani (electricity) for everyone, khichdi (load shedding) helps us get by. And hey, sometimes a simple khichdi is all you need. In the long run, though, proper energy management and infrastructure upgrades are the real solutions. Let’s aim for a future where load shedding is just a distant memory.
