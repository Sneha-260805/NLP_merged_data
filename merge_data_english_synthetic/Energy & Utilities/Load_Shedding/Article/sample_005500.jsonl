{"unnormalised": "In the energy and utilities world, load shedding is basically a controlled power outage. Think of it like this: imagine a really, REALLY popular street food stall in Chandni Chowk. If too many people try to order at once, the stall owner might temporarily stop serving customers to catch up, right? Load shedding is kind of the same thing. The power grid gets overloaded, and to prevent a total system collapse – imagine Mumbai without power! - they strategically cut off electricity to certain areas.", "normalised": "In the energy and utilities world, load shedding is basically a controlled power outage.

{"unnormalised": "Why does it happen? Well, there are a bunch of reasons. Sometimes it’s because of increased demand, especially during peak hours or during super hot summer days when everyone cranks up their ACs. Remember that heatwave in Rajasthan last summer? Load shedding was almost a daily ritual. Other times, it's due to problems with power generation or transmission – maybe a faulty power plant in Andhra Pradesh or a broken transmission line somewhere between Lucknow and Kanpur. The infrastructure, while improving, still faces challenges, especially in rapidly developing areas.", "normalised": "Why does it happen? Well, there are a bunch of reasons.
