{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, or planned power cuts, is basically when the electricity company, like Tata Power DDL, deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing. Think of it like this: the power grid is like a big thali of food, and everyone's grabbing for more. If too many people grab at once, the thali will topple, right? Load shedding is the electricity board's way of making sure the \"thali\" doesn't fall.", "normalised": "Load shedding, or planned power cuts, is basically when the electricity company, like T A T A Power D D L, deliberately cuts off power supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing.

{"unnormalised": "But why does this happen, you ask? Well, there are a few reasons. Sometimes it's because the demand for electricity is simply higher than the supply. Especially during peak hours, like evenings when everyone's home from work and switching on their ACs, the power plants can struggle to keep up. Other times, it's due to infrastructure issues. Maybe a transformer blows up somewhere in Meerut, or a power line gets damaged during a monsoon storm. These things happen, you know?", "normalised": "But why does this happen, you ask?

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, we can all try to conserve energy, switch off appliances when we're not using them, and maybe even invest in a small solar panel for our homes.
