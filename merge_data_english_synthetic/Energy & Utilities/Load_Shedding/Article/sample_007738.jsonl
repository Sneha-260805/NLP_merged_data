Yeah, I'm talking about power cuts, blackout periods, call it what you will – it all boils down to the same frustrating experience of your fan slowing to a crawl in the middle of a Chennai summer."}

In the twenty first century, shouldn’t we be past this? Well, the simple explanation is that the demand for electricity sometimes exceeds the supply. Think of it like this: Imagine everyone in Mumbai suddenly deciding to cook biryani at the exact same time. The market's going to run out of ingredients, right? Same principle applies to the power grid. Too many people switching on their A C s, T V s, and chargers, and the system gets overloaded. Distribution companies, like B E S C O M in Bangalore or Tata Power in Delhi, have to resort to load shedding to prevent a complete system collapse. It's basically a controlled blackout to protect the entire grid."}

Old transformers, faulty cables, and under-investment in power generation all contribute to the problem. Remember that news report about the power plant in Rajasthan that needed rupee five hundred crore for upgrades? Yeah, stuff like that impacts us all. And let's not forget those sneaky power thieves hooking up illegal connections – they add to the strain too."}

Switch off lights when you leave a room, use energy-efficient appliances, and maybe, just maybe, embrace the fan a little more often.
