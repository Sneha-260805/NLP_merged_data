{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, also known as scheduled power cuts, remains a persistent challenge in various parts of India, impacting economic productivity and the quality of life for millions. This controlled interruption of electricity supply is implemented by power distribution companies (DISCOMs) to prevent a total system blackout when the demand for electricity exceeds the available supply. Factors contributing to this imbalance include inadequate generation capacity, transmission bottlenecks, and increased consumption, particularly during peak hours like summer afternoons and festive seasons.", "normalised": "Load shedding, also known as scheduled power cuts, remains a persistent challenge in various parts of India, impacting economic productivity and the quality of life for millions.

{"unnormalised": "The primary reason for load shedding stems from the inability of the existing infrastructure to reliably meet the growing electricity demand. While India has significantly increased its power generation capacity over the past decade, distribution infrastructure often lags behind, leading to transmission and distribution losses. States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with large populations and rapidly expanding economies, are particularly susceptible to load shedding, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "The primary reason for load shedding stems from the inability of the existing infrastructure to reliably meet the growing electricity demand.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching. Industries face production losses, impacting their profitability and potentially leading to job losses. Businesses dependent on uninterrupted power supply, such as IT companies in Bangalore or manufacturing units in Chennai, require costly backup power solutions like diesel generators, further increasing operational expenses.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, prolonged power cuts disrupt daily life. Students preparing for exams face difficulties in studying, households experience inconvenience with refrigeration and other essential appliances, and healthcare facilities are forced to rely on backup generators, potentially compromising patient care. Imagine preparing for a grand Onam feast in Kerala, only to have the lights go out, halting the preparation of the delicious sadhya.", "normalised": "Furthermore, prolonged power cuts disrupt daily life.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on coal-based power plants. Smart grid technologies can also play a crucial role in optimizing power distribution and reducing transmission losses. Furthermore, promoting energy conservation through public awareness campaigns and incentives for energy-efficient appliances can help reduce peak demand.", "normalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, eradicating load shedding is essential for India's continued economic growth and social progress. Ensuring a reliable and affordable electricity supply is crucial for achieving the nation's development goals and improving the lives of its citizens. For example, businesses in Kanpur, a major industrial hub, often face production delays due to frequent load shedding, costing the region an estimated Rs. 50 crores annually. Investing in robust infrastructure and implementing effective demand-side management strategies are key to overcoming this challenge and building a brighter future for India.", "normalised": "Ultimately, eradicating load shedding is essential for India's continued economic growth and social progress.
