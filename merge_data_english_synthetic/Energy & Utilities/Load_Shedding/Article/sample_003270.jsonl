{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, remember that sinking feeling when the lights flicker and die right in the middle of your favourite IPL match? Yep, that's load shedding hitting you like a badly timed bouncer from Bumrah. Load shedding, or planned power outages, is basically when the power company, usually the state electricity board (like MSEB in Maharashtra or BESCOM in Karnataka), deliberately cuts off electricity supply to certain areas. They do this to prevent the whole system from collapsing when demand is higher than the supply.", "normalised": "hey everyone remember that sinking feeling when the lights flicker and die right in the middle of your favourite I P L match yep that is load shedding hitting you like a badly timed bouncer from Bumrah load shedding or planned power outages is basically when the power company usually the state electricity board like M S E B in Maharashtra or B E S C O M in Karnataka deliberately cuts off electricity supply to certain areas they do this to prevent the whole system from collapsing when demand is higher than the supply"}

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, a bunch of reasons. Sometimes it's because the power plants aren't producing enough juice. Maybe the coal supply is low (thanks, disruptions!) or a generator is down for maintenance. Other times, it's just too darn hot in Delhi or Chennai in the summer, and everyone cranks up their ACs, leading to a massive spike in demand. Seriously, try explaining to Auntie Sharma that she can't run her AC at full blast during a heat wave!", "normalised": "why does this happen well a bunch of reasons sometimes it is because the power plants are not producing enough juice maybe the coal supply is low thanks disruptions or a generator is down for maintenance other times it is just too darn hot in Delhi or Chennai in the summer and everyone cranks up their A C s leading to a massive spike in demand seriously try explaining to Auntie Sharma that she cannot run her A C at full blast during a heat wave"}

{"unnormalised": "What can we do? Well, on a personal level, using energy-efficient appliances (like those 5-star rated refrigerators) helps. We can also consider investing in inverters or solar panels, although those can be a bit expensive.

{"unnormalised": "On a larger scale, we need better infrastructure and more investment in renewable energy sources. The government needs to invest in improving the grid so that it can handle peak demand and reduce transmission losses. Maybe we can get the power from the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project to actually flow sometime soon! We also need to hold the power companies accountable and demand more transparency in their operations. After all, we are paying our bills, right? And paying exorbitant amounts at that!
