{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate shutdown of electricity supply in specific areas to prevent system-wide blackouts, continues to be a recurring problem within India's energy and utilities landscape. While significant strides have been made in expanding generation capacity, infrastructure bottlenecks, peak demand surges, and financial constraints on distribution companies (DISCOMs) often necessitate this disruptive measure. This article will analyze the persistent challenges associated with load shedding, focusing on its impact and potential mitigation strategies within the Indian context.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate shutdown of electricity supply in specific areas to prevent system-wide blackouts, continues to be a recurring problem within India's energy and utilities landscape.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding is multi-faceted, affecting households, businesses, and critical infrastructure. For residential consumers, particularly in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, load shedding disrupts daily routines, impacts access to water (especially reliant on electric pumps), and hinders educational activities, particularly for students preparing for crucial examinations. Scheduled power cuts, often lasting for several hours, are announced via local news channels or SMS alerts by the DISCOMs. For example, areas in Kanpur experienced scheduled outages between 14:00 hrs and 17:00 hrs daily during peak summer months in 2023.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding is multi-faceted, affecting households, businesses, and critical infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Businesses, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), suffer significant financial losses due to production stoppages. Factories in industrial hubs like Gurgaon and Chennai, reliant on continuous power supply for manufacturing processes, often resort to expensive diesel generators, incurring additional operational costs. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that power outages cost Indian businesses Rs. 1.5 trillion annually.", "normalised": "Businesses, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (S M E s), suffer significant financial losses due to production stoppages.

{"unnormalised": "Critical infrastructure, including hospitals and telecommunication networks, are also vulnerable. While most hospitals have backup generators, ensuring a seamless transition during power cuts is crucial, especially for life-support systems. Telecom towers rely on battery backup, which can be quickly depleted during extended load shedding periods, leading to network disruptions. The state of Maharashtra faced a severe power crisis on 26/01/2024, leading to widespread concerns about essential services.", "normalised": "Critical infrastructure, including hospitals and telecommunication networks, are also vulnerable.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, investments in upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure are paramount. Aging infrastructure leads to frequent breakdowns and limits the capacity to transport power efficiently.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, fostering renewable energy generation and integrating it into the grid can diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on traditional sources. India's ambitious renewable energy targets, aiming for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, are a step in the right direction. Rooftop solar programs, like the Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana launched on 15/02/2024, also empower consumers to generate their own electricity, reducing the burden on the grid. Overcoming load shedding requires sustained commitment from the government, utilities, and consumers alike to ensure a reliable and affordable power supply for all.", "normalised": "Finally, fostering renewable energy generation and integrating it into the grid can diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on traditional sources.
