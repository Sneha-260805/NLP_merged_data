{"unnormalised": "Alright, folks, let's talk load shedding. That dreaded phrase that's as familiar to us as chai in the morning, especially during the scorching Delhi summers or the festive rush of Diwali in Mumbai. In the energy & utilities world, load shedding basically means strategically cutting off electricity supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing. Think of it like this: you're making biryani for the whole family during Onam, and the gas stove is struggling. Instead of blowing a fuse (or in this case, the whole power grid), you decide to cook the chicken separately and then add it in, lightening the load.", "normalised": "Alright, folks, let's talk load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen? Well, often it's a simple supply-demand mismatch. Too much electricity is being used, especially when everyone in Bangalore is cranking up their ACs at the same time, and not enough is being generated to keep up. Thermal power plants might be facing coal shortages, like that time in 2021 when things got really dicey. Or maybe there are issues with transmission lines – like a tree falling on a high-tension wire near Chennai. Infrastructure issues, my friend, infrastructure issues!", "normalised": "Why does this happen? Well, often it's a simple supply-demand mismatch.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences? Oh, where do we even begin? Businesses grind to a halt, hospitals struggle to keep critical equipment running (imagine the horror!), and students prepping for exams in Lucknow have to rely on candlelight. It's frustrating, to say the least. I remember one time during Ganesh Chaturthi, the entire neighbourhood went dark just as the aarti was about to start. The collective groan was almost as loud as the drums we were using!", "normalised": "The consequences? Oh, where do we even begin?

{"unnormalised": "However, let's be real, it’s not a quick fix. The demand for electricity in India is only going to increase as our economy grows. So, we also need to be more mindful of our own consumption. Switching to energy-efficient appliances, using LEDs instead of traditional bulbs, and even something as simple as turning off lights when we leave a room can make a difference. Think of it as contributing your own grain of rice to the pot of biryani, ensuring there's enough for everyone.", "normalised": "However, let's be real, it’s not a quick fix.
