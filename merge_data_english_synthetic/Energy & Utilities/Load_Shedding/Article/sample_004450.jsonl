{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary shutdown of electricity supply in parts of the power grid, continues to be a recurring issue in many regions of India, impacting economic activity and daily life.

{"unnormalised": "The reasons for load shedding are multifaceted. A key factor is the demand-supply mismatch, particularly during peak hours, like during the summer months in cities like Delhi and Jaipur when air conditioning usage surges. Inefficient transmission and distribution (T&D) networks, characterized by high Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, also contribute significantly. These losses, often exceeding 20% in some states, reduce the available power for consumers. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure investments, especially in rural areas, can lead to localized shortages and necessitate load shedding.", "normalised": "the reasons for load shedding are multifaceted. a key factor is the demand-supply mismatch, particularly during peak hours, like during the summer months in cities like delhi and jaipur when air conditioning usage surges. inefficient transmission and distribution (t and d) networks, characterized by high aggregate technical and commercial (a t and c) losses, also contribute significantly. these losses, often exceeding twenty percent in some states, reduce the available power for consumers. furthermore, inadequate infrastructure investments, especially in rural areas, can lead to localized shortages and necessitate load shedding."}
{"unnormalised": "Several states, including Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, frequently experience load shedding, impacting industries, agriculture, and households. Farmers, for instance, often face difficulty irrigating their fields when power is unavailable during crucial periods. Small businesses, like the garment shops in Surat, suffer production losses due to power outages. Residential areas experience disruptions to daily routines, particularly during evening hours when demand is highest. Remember the Diwali of 2022, when several parts of Lucknow experienced unscheduled outages?", "normalised": "several states, including bihar and uttar pradesh, frequently experience load shedding, impacting industries, agriculture, and households. farmers, for instance, often face difficulty irrigating their fields when power is unavailable during crucial periods. small businesses, like the garment shops in surat, suffer production losses due to power outages. residential areas experience disruptions to daily routines, particularly during evening hours when demand is highest. remember the diwali of two thousand and twenty two, when several parts of lucknow experienced unscheduled outages?"}
{"unnormalised": "The government has implemented various measures to address the issue, including the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) aimed at rural electrification and the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) focusing on strengthening urban power distribution networks.

{"unnormalised": "However, the problem persists. A key area needing improvement is demand-side management. Promoting energy conservation measures and incentivizing off-peak consumption can help flatten the demand curve and reduce the need for load shedding. Smart grids, with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), can also enable better monitoring and control of power flow. On 26/01/1950, India pledged itself to progress. Energy availability is undeniably critical to this.", "normalised": "however, the problem persists. a key area needing improvement is demand-side management. promoting energy conservation measures and incentivizing off-peak consumption can help flatten the demand curve and reduce the need for load shedding. smart grids, with advanced metering infrastructure (a m i), can also enable better monitoring and control of power flow. on twenty sixth january nineteen fifty, india pledged itself to progress. energy availability is undeniably critical to this."}
{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, a holistic approach is required. This includes continued investment in generation capacity, strengthening T&D infrastructure, reducing AT&C losses, promoting energy efficiency, and implementing effective demand-side management strategies. Regular monitoring and accurate forecasting of power demand are also crucial. The India Meteorological Department's (IMD) weather forecasts must be integrated with power dispatch schedules. Furthermore, improving the financial viability of DISCOMs is essential for attracting private investment and ensuring the sustainable supply of electricity. On 15/08/2023, many districts still reported scheduled power cuts around 18:00 hrs. The government aims to provide 24x7 power to all by 2030, a goal that requires sustained effort and innovation across the energy and utilities sector.", "normalised": "looking ahead, a holistic approach is required. this includes continued investment in generation capacity, strengthening t and d infrastructure, reducing a t and c losses, promoting energy efficiency, and implementing effective demand-side management strategies. regular monitoring and accurate forecasting of power demand are also crucial. the india meteorological department's (i m d) weather forecasts must be integrated with power dispatch schedules. furthermore, improving the financial viability of d i s c o m s is essential for attracting private investment and ensuring the sustainable supply of electricity. on fifteenth august two thousand and twenty three, many districts still reported scheduled power cuts around eighteen zero zero hours. the government aims to provide twenty four by seven power to all by two thousand and thirty, a goal that requires sustained effort and innovation across the energy and utilities sector."}
