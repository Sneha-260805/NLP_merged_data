Well, India's electricity demand is constantly growing. We have more A C's, more factories churning out stuff, more people charging their phones (and watching cat videos, let's be honest). Sometimes, the power plants just can't keep up, especially older ones. And during peak seasons, like around Diwali when everyone's got their fairy lights blazing and the mithai shops are working overtime, the grid gets seriously stressed."}
