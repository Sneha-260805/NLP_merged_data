Load shedding – that dreaded phrase we hear all too often, especially during those scorching Delhi summers or right before Diwali when everyone's got their fairy lights blazing. It's back, and it's not making anyone happy."}

Why? Well, usually it's because demand is higher than the supply. Imagine everyone in your mohalla cranking up their A C s to beat the heat, and the poor transformers just can't cope. Bang! Load shedding."}

Sometimes it's a legitimate infrastructure problem. Maybe a cable got damaged by the monsoon rains in Kerala, or a generator at a power plant in Chattisgarh broke down. Other times, it's just plain mismanagement and not enough investment in upgrading the power grid. We need better infrastructure, more efficient power generation, and maybe even a national awareness campaign on energy conservation. Remember those \"Save Electricity\" ads from Doordarshan back in the day? Maybe it's time to bring them back!"}

Switch to L E D bulbs, use appliances wisely, and maybe think twice before cranking the A C down to sixteen degree Celsius. More importantly, we need to hold our elected officials accountable and demand better planning and investment in our energy infrastructure. Load shedding shouldn't be a way of life in the twenty first century, especially not in a country aiming to be a superpower!"}
