Think of it like this: Imagine auntyji trying to make biryani for the entire Sharma family gathering during Diwali. If she puts too much pressure on the gas stove all at once, the whole thing might conk out, right? Load shedding is kinda like that, but for the whole electricity grid."}

Sometimes it's simply not enough power being generated to meet the demand. Think peak summer in Delhi when everyone’s A C is blasting full force. Other times, it’s due to problems with the power plants themselves – maybe a breakdown or maintenance work happening at the N T P C plant in Badarpur. Old infrastructure, especially in smaller towns like, say, near Patna, also contributes. Think rusty wires and outdated transformers that can't handle the load. And sometimes, shockingly, it's because of electricity theft, with people tapping into the grid illegally, overloading the system for everyone else. Chor bazaar electric style, not cool!"}
