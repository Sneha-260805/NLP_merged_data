{"unnormalised": "The reasons for load shedding are multifaceted. Primarily, it arises from a supply-demand imbalance. During peak hours, typically between 18:00 hrs and 22:00 hrs in urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi, the demand for electricity surges, often exceeding the available generation capacity and transmission infrastructure's ability to deliver it reliably. Factors contributing to this imbalance include increased air conditioning usage during the hot summer months (especially around April-May), the rapid expansion of industries, and the growing reliance on electricity for daily activities.", "normalised": "The reasons for load shedding are multifaceted. Primarily, it arises from a supply-demand imbalance.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, inadequate or aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure contributes significantly to the problem. Transmission losses, estimated to be around 20% in some states, reduce the effective amount of power available to consumers. In rural areas, like those in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the infrastructure is often poorly maintained, leading to frequent breakdowns and unscheduled power outages, sometimes lasting for several hours.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inadequate or aging transmission and distribution (T and D) infrastructure contributes significantly to the problem.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding is widespread. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), face production losses, leading to economic setbacks. Hospitals and critical infrastructure rely on backup generators, incurring additional costs. Households experience disruptions in daily life, affecting everything from lighting and cooling to access to essential services like water supply, which often relies on electric pumps. Students preparing for crucial exams like the IIT-JEE or the UPSC Civil Services exam also find their studies severely hampered by power cuts, particularly irritating when announced at inconvenient times like 23/01/2024.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding is widespread.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. Increasing generation capacity, particularly through renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, is crucial. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, launched on 11/01/2010, aimed to promote solar energy adoption, but further investments and policy support are needed to fully realize its potential. Upgrading and modernizing T&D infrastructure to reduce transmission losses and improve grid stability is equally important. Initiatives like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) are aimed at strengthening sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas, but their effective implementation is essential.", "normalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, demand-side management strategies, such as promoting energy-efficient appliances and implementing time-of-use tariffs, can help reduce peak demand. Public awareness campaigns can also play a role in encouraging consumers to conserve energy. Implementing smart grid technologies, which enable real-time monitoring and control of the power grid, can further enhance efficiency and reliability. Ultimately, a sustained and concerted effort from the government, utilities, and consumers is needed to overcome the challenge of load shedding and ensure a reliable and affordable power supply for all, paving the way for a brighter and more prosperous India. The projected investment in power sector improvements till 2030 is estimated at Rs. 2.6 trillion.", "normalised": "Furthermore, demand-side management strategies, such as promoting energy-efficient appliances and implementing time-of-use tariffs, can help reduce peak demand.
