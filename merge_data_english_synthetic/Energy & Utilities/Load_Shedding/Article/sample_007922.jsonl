{"unnormalised": "One primary driver of load shedding is the supply-demand mismatch. During peak hours, particularly during the hot summer months in states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the demand for electricity surges due to increased usage of air conditioning and irrigation pumps. If the generation and distribution infrastructure cannot adequately meet this demand, Discoms (Distribution Companies) resort to load shedding to prevent a complete system collapse. Transmission losses, often exceeding 20% in some regions due to outdated infrastructure, further exacerbate this imbalance.", "normalised": "One primary driver of load shedding is the supply or demand mismatch.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant contributing factor is the financial health of many Discoms. Heavily indebted and often operating at a loss, these companies struggle to invest in upgrading infrastructure and procuring sufficient power. This financial instability stems from factors such as subsidized electricity tariffs for agricultural consumers, high Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, and delayed payments from state governments. A bailout package of Rs. 90,000 crore announced previously aimed to address this, but its long-term impact remains to be seen.", "normalised": "Another significant contributing factor is the financial health of many D I S C O M S.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching. Industries, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing hubs like Surat and Coimbatore, suffer significant production losses. Households experience inconvenience, disrupting daily routines and impacting children’s studies, especially during examination periods. In rural areas, load shedding can cripple agricultural activities reliant on electric pumps for irrigation. Imagine preparing for Onam celebrations in Kerala only to have the lights go out, making it impossible to grind the rice for the traditional payasam.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, aggressive investment in upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure is crucial. This includes replacing old cables, installing smart grids for better load management, and reducing transmission losses. Secondly, improving the financial viability of Discoms through tariff reforms, efficient billing and collection practices, and stricter enforcement of regulations is essential. Thirdly, promoting energy efficiency measures, such as the adoption of energy-efficient appliances and lighting, can help reduce peak demand. Encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, can also diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on conventional sources. Furthermore, improved coal supply to thermal power plants, especially during periods of high demand, is critical. States like Jharkhand, rich in coal reserves, need to ensure a steady supply to power plants across the country. Finally, enhanced grid discipline and real-time monitoring of power flows are vital to prevent grid disturbances and minimize the need for load shedding. Without consistent and strategic efforts, the taste of a delicious biryani, or any other festive meal, can be soured by the frustrating reality of unplanned power cuts.", "normalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach.
