{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary shutdown of electricity supply in parts of the grid to prevent system-wide blackouts, remains a persistent challenge for India's energy and utilities sector. This practice, often implemented during periods of peak demand or supply shortfalls, disproportionately affects households and businesses, hindering economic productivity and impacting the quality of life. While significant strides have been made in recent years to enhance electricity generation and distribution infrastructure, load shedding continues to be a reality in many regions, particularly during the hot summer months when air conditioning usage surges.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary shutdown of electricity supply in parts of the grid to prevent system-wide blackouts, remains a persistent challenge for India's energy and utilities sector.

{"unnormalised": "The root causes of load shedding are multifaceted. Inadequate generation capacity relative to peak demand remains a key issue, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, often exceeding 20% in some areas, further exacerbate the problem. Theft of electricity (power pilferage) and inefficient grid management contribute significantly to these losses. A dependence on aging infrastructure, some of which dates back to pre-independence era, further reduces the reliability of power supply. On 15/08/1947, when India gained independence, electricity access was limited to a small fraction of the population, and building a robust and nationwide grid has been a continuous process.", "normalised": "The root causes of load shedding are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial. Industries, from small-scale enterprises in Kanpur to large manufacturing plants in Gurgaon, experience production disruptions, leading to losses in revenue and potential job cuts. Small businesses relying on electricity for their operations, such as tailoring shops owned by Rahim Chacha in Old Delhi, are severely affected by unscheduled power cuts. The impact extends to agriculture, where irrigation pumps dependent on electricity falter during crucial periods, impacting crop yields and farmer incomes. A sudden load shedding at 09:00 hrs can cripple a factory relying on precise manufacturing processes.", "normalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach. Increasing generation capacity through investments in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, coupled with improvements in thermal power plant efficiency, is crucial. Strengthening the T&D infrastructure to reduce losses and enhance grid stability is equally important. This includes upgrading substations, replacing outdated transmission lines, and investing in smart grid technologies that enable real-time monitoring and control. Implementing effective measures to curb power theft and improve revenue collection is also essential. Many states have implemented schemes offering subsidies of Rs. 200 per month to encourage efficient energy use.", "normalised": "Addressing load shedding requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, promoting energy conservation among consumers through awareness campaigns and incentives for using energy-efficient appliances can help reduce peak demand. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) plays a vital role in setting energy efficiency standards and promoting energy conservation initiatives. Developing distributed generation models, such as rooftop solar installations in residential areas, can also alleviate pressure on the grid. Ensuring consistent and reliable power supply requires sustained investments, effective policy implementation, and active participation from all stakeholders. Eliminating load shedding across the nation is projected to require an investment exceeding Rs. 50,000 crore and continuous monitoring up to 31/12/2025.", "normalised": "Furthermore, promoting energy conservation among consumers through awareness campaigns and incentives for using energy-efficient appliances can help reduce peak demand.
