{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, or planned electricity outages, remains a persistent challenge in certain regions of India, impacting industries, households, and overall economic productivity. Despite significant advancements in power generation and grid infrastructure, the gap between electricity supply and demand continues to necessitate periodic outages, particularly during peak consumption periods and in areas with inadequate infrastructure.", "normalised": "Load shedding, or planned electricity outages, remains a persistent challenge in certain regions of India, impacting industries, households, and overall economic productivity.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding. Rapid urbanization and industrial growth have fueled an ever-increasing demand for electricity, stretching existing infrastructure to its limits. Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, estimated at around 20% in some states, further exacerbate the problem. These losses, stemming from technical inefficiencies, theft, and inadequate maintenance, reduce the amount of electricity available to consumers. Coal shortages, often impacting thermal power plants which constitute a significant portion of India's energy mix, also trigger power cuts. Delays in commissioning new power plants, due to land acquisition issues, environmental clearances, and logistical bottlenecks, also add to the problem.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in regions like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, face significant production losses due to disrupted operations. These losses impact their competitiveness and can lead to job cuts. Households experience inconvenience, affecting daily routines and access to essential services like water supply. Students preparing for competitive exams such as the IIT-JEE face difficulties in studying. During the scorching summers of Rajasthan or the humid monsoon season in Kerala, the lack of electricity can severely affect the well-being of vulnerable populations. Even simple pleasures, like enjoying a plate of flavourful biryani on a Sunday afternoon, are diminished by the sweltering heat and lack of air conditioning.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach. Investments in upgrading and modernizing T&D infrastructure are crucial to reduce losses and improve grid stability. Promoting energy efficiency measures, such as the adoption of LED lighting and energy-efficient appliances, can help curb demand. Increasing the share of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on coal. Smart grid technologies, including real-time monitoring and demand response systems, can help optimize electricity distribution and manage peak loads effectively.", "normalised": "Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, strengthening regulatory frameworks and improving the financial health of distribution companies (Discoms) are essential. The UDAY scheme, for instance, aims to improve the operational and financial efficiency of Discoms. Addressing the issue of electricity theft, which costs the nation Rs. 50,000 crores annually, requires stringent enforcement and public awareness campaigns. Successfully navigating this complex landscape is crucial to ensuring reliable and affordable electricity for all citizens, especially during important festivals like Onam, when households consume more electricity. Only then can India truly realize its economic potential and improve the quality of life for its citizens.", "normalised": "Furthermore, strengthening regulatory frameworks and improving the financial health of distribution companies (Discoms) are essential.
