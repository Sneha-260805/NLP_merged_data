Yes, the dreaded power cuts are back, and it's like Auntie Shanti's insistent questions about marriage prospects – unavoidable and deeply irritating. Remember that time when load shedding struck right in the middle of the India versus Pakistan cricket match? The collective groan across the nation was deafening!"}
{"unnormalised": "Load Shedding: Ugh, Not Again!", "normalised": "What exactly is this 'load shedding' anyway? Basically, it's when the power company, like Tata Power in Mumbai or B E S C O M in Bangalore, intentionally cuts off electricity supply to certain areas to prevent the entire grid from collapsing. Think of it like this: imagine everyone in Delhi trying to charge their phones at the same time. The power grid is like a big bucket of water; if too many people draw from it at once, it gets empty, and everyone suffers a complete blackout. Load shedding, though annoying, is supposed to prevent that total system meltdown."}

Well, a major reason is increased demand. Everyone cranks up their A C s to combat the forty five degree celsius heat or uses electric heaters when it drops to five degree celsius. This surge in electricity usage can strain the power grid beyond its capacity. Also, sometimes there are issues with power generation or transmission. Perhaps a coal shortage at a thermal power plant or a snag in the transmission lines from a hydro-electric dam in the Himalayas."}

Firstly, let's be mindful of our energy consumption. Turn off lights and fans when not needed. Use energy-efficient appliances.

The Government also provides subsidies for solar panel installations, sometimes up to rupee fifty thousand. Think of it as an investment, and a way to tell load shedding, \"Not today!\""}
