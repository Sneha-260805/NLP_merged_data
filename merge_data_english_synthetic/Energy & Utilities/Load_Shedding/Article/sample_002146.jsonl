Fans barely spinning, inverters blinking red, and everyone crowded around the neighbor who had a generator, watching Hum Aapke Hain Koun on their flickering black and white T V. Simpler times, maybe, but definitely sweatier."}

Well, usually it is because demand for electricity is higher than the supply. Think of it like this: everyone in Mumbai switches on their A C at two P M on a scorching hot day. The power grid, already stressed by factories and everything else, just cannot handle it. So, instead of a total blackout, they strategically cut off power to certain areas. It is supposed to be a controlled blackout, preventing a bigger disaster."}

Even hospitals face huge challenges, relying on backup generators which, let us be honest, are not always reliable, are they?"}

Invest in a good inverter, a reliable battery backup, and maybe learn to live without electricity for a few hours. Stock up on candles and board games. Or, you know, actually talk to your family. It might be a welcome change from endlessly scrolling through your phone. And hey, maybe you will even discover a hidden talent for shadow puppetry! Silver linings, people, silver linings! It is all about making the best of a frustrating situation, right? And maybe complaining a little on Twitter using hash Load Shedding Blues. That helps too, I find."}
