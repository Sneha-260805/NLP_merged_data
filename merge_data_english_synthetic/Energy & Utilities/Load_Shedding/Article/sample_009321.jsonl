{"unnormalised": "The practice is typically implemented when demand for electricity exceeds available supply. This imbalance can stem from various factors, including insufficient generating capacity, transmission bottlenecks, or unexpected surges in consumption, particularly during peak hours like the scorching summer months when air conditioning usage spikes dramatically. States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and even parts of Maharashtra have historically been susceptible to load shedding, impacting industrial output, agricultural activities, and the daily lives of ordinary citizens like Mrs. Sharma in Lucknow who depends on electricity to power her small tailoring business.", "normalised": "The practice is typically implemented when demand for electricity exceeds available supply.

{"unnormalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial. Industries face production losses, impacting GDP growth. For instance, a textile mill in Surat loses an estimated Rs. 50,000 per hour during unscheduled power cuts. Farmers relying on electric pumps for irrigation suffer crop failures, potentially leading to food security concerns, especially in drought-prone regions. Furthermore, frequent power outages damage electrical equipment, increasing maintenance costs and requiring costly replacements.", "normalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial.

{"unnormalised": "Several initiatives have been undertaken to mitigate the problem. The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (now subsumed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana) aimed to electrify all villages by extending grid connectivity. The Integrated Power Development Scheme focuses on strengthening sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas. Moreover, investments in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are being actively promoted to diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on traditional fossil fuels. The target is to achieve 40% of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.", "normalised": "Several initiatives have been undertaken to mitigate the problem.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges persist. Delayed infrastructure projects, inefficient distribution networks, and inadequate regulatory frameworks often hinder progress. Accurate demand forecasting and effective load management are crucial to minimizing the need for load shedding. Implementation of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure can enable better monitoring and control of electricity consumption, allowing utilities like Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited to respond proactively to fluctuations in demand.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, a concerted effort is needed to address the root causes of load shedding. This includes investing in robust transmission and distribution infrastructure, promoting energy conservation measures, and fostering greater public awareness about responsible energy consumption. Moreover, timely completion of power generation projects and effective enforcement of regulations are essential to ensure a reliable and sustainable electricity supply for all Indians. We expect further improvements to be noticeable from January 1, 2025 onwards. The power outage experienced on 16/06/2024 at 14:00 hrs in several parts of Mumbai serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that remain. Regular maintenance shutdowns, as scheduled for the Badarpur Thermal Power Station on 05/03/2023, are necessary but exacerbate the immediate problem.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, a concerted effort is needed to address the root causes of load shedding.
