{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're probably reading this during a dreaded power cut, right? Yup, load shedding. That pesky term we Indians know all too well. Basically, it's when the electricity supply company, like maybe BESCOM in Bangalore or Tata Power in Mumbai, deliberately cuts off power to certain areas for a specific period. Why? Well, usually because the demand for electricity is higher than what they can supply. Think scorching summer days in Delhi when everyone’s blasting their ACs, or during Diwali when the whole nation is lit up brighter than a wedding procession.", "normalised": "Okay, so you're probably reading this during a dreaded power cut, right?

{"unnormalised": "It's a bit like making biryani for a party. You’ve only got enough rice and chicken for 20 people, but 40 show up. You gotta tell half the guests, “Sorry, no biryani for you tonight!” Not ideal, right?

{"unnormalised": "Now, the reasons behind load shedding are complicated. Sometimes it's because of old infrastructure. Think outdated power plants struggling to keep up, or transmission lines that look like they were installed back in the British Raj. Other times, it's due to fuel shortages, especially coal. We all remember that coal crisis scare a while back, right? That definitely contributed to some serious load shedding in certain states. Plus, sometimes it’s just plain old mismanagement. You know, the kind where someone forgot to order enough fuel, or didn't properly maintain the grid.", "normalised": "Now, the reasons behind load shedding are complicated.

{"unnormalised": "Load shedding is a major pain, especially for businesses. Imagine running a small shop in Chennai and suddenly the lights go out. No fans, no computers, no charging phones for customers. It's a productivity killer and can really dent profits. Students preparing for exams also suffer.

{"unnormalised": "The government is trying to tackle this, of course. Investments in renewable energy like solar and wind are increasing, which is great.

{"unnormalised": "So, next time the power goes out, try to stay calm, light a diya (earthen lamp) if you have one, and remember you're not alone. Millions of Indians are probably experiencing the same thing. Maybe even use the time to catch up with family… or plan that perfect revenge on your power company! Just kidding (mostly). But seriously, let's hope for a future with fewer power cuts and more uninterrupted biryani-making (and eating!) opportunities. Perhaps a 24x7 power supply is just a matter of few more years. Let's hope they keep their promises to keep the lights on.", "normalised": "So, next time the power goes out, try to stay calm, light a diya (earthen lamp) if you have one, and remember you're not alone.
