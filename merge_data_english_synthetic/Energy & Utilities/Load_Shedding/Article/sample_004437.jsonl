{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary interruption of electricity supply to certain areas or consumers, remains a recurring challenge within India's energy and utilities sector. This practice is typically implemented by power distribution companies (DISCOMs) to manage electricity demand exceeding available supply, thereby preventing widespread system collapse and maintaining grid stability. While aimed at preserving the integrity of the national power grid, load shedding significantly impacts various aspects of daily life, economic activity, and social well-being, particularly in rural areas and smaller towns.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate temporary interruption of electricity supply to certain areas or consumers, remains a recurring challenge within India's energy and utilities sector.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding in India. These include rapid economic growth leading to increased electricity demand, inadequate infrastructure investment in transmission and distribution networks, inefficiencies in power generation and distribution, and the reliance on aging power plants. Seasonal variations in demand, such as peak summer months when air conditioning usage spikes, further exacerbate the problem. For instance, during the summer of 2023, many regions experienced unscheduled power cuts lasting several hours daily. In Uttar Pradesh, particularly in districts like Kanpur and Allahabad, peak demand often outstrips supply, leading to frequent load shedding, sometimes exceeding 6 hours per day.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the prevalence of load shedding in India.

{"unnormalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial. Businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), face production losses due to power outages, hindering their ability to meet deadlines and maintain competitiveness. In agricultural sectors, particularly during the crucial irrigation seasons, unreliable power supply can lead to crop failures and reduced agricultural output, impacting the livelihoods of farmers. The healthcare sector is also significantly affected, with hospitals and clinics relying on expensive diesel generators as backup power sources, adding to operational costs.", "normalised": "The economic consequences of load shedding are substantial.

{"unnormalised": "The social implications of load shedding are equally profound. Prolonged power outages can disrupt daily routines, affect access to essential services like water supply (often dependent on electric pumps), and compromise safety and security, particularly during nighttime hours. Students preparing for examinations, for example, often face difficulties studying during load shedding hours, impacting their academic performance. Many villages still rely on kerosene lamps during such times, creating health and environmental hazards.", "normalised": "The social implications of load shedding are equally profound.

{"unnormalised": "To address the issue of load shedding, the Indian government has undertaken several initiatives, including investments in renewable energy sources, the modernization of transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the promotion of energy efficiency measures. The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) aims to provide continuous power supply to rural areas. Projects like the Green Energy Corridor are designed to facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the national grid. Smart grid technologies are also being explored to improve grid management and reduce transmission losses. However, the implementation of these initiatives requires sustained effort, coordinated planning, and effective public-private partnerships. Many areas still struggle with daily cuts, even after official electrification, as demonstrated in villages around Bhagalpur on 26/01/2024 and again on 15/08/2024.", "normalised": "To address the issue of load shedding, the Indian government has undertaken several initiatives, including investments in renewable energy sources, the modernization of transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the promotion of energy efficiency measures.

{"unnormalised": "The situation is not uniform across the country. States with stronger financial positions and more efficient DISCOMs, like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, generally experience less load shedding than states with weaker infrastructure and financial constraints. The Power Ministry is reportedly aiming for a load shedding free India by 2030, but a lot needs to be done. Improving the financial health of DISCOMs, reducing transmission and distribution losses (currently around 20% nationally), and promoting energy conservation among consumers are crucial steps toward achieving this goal. The scheduled maintenance on substations also contributes to short term planned outages, typically between 09:00 hrs and 17:00 hrs. Furthermore, community participation and awareness campaigns can play a vital role in managing electricity demand and promoting responsible energy consumption habits.", "normalised": "The situation is not uniform across the country.
