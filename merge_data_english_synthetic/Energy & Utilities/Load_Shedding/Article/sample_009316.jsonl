{"unnormalised": "The root causes of load shedding in India are multifaceted. Firstly, rapid economic growth, especially in Tier-II and Tier-III cities like Lucknow and Patna, has led to a surge in electricity demand, sometimes outpacing the existing generation and transmission capacities. Peak demand often occurs during the summer months, particularly between 10:00 hrs and 16:00 hrs, driven by increased air conditioning usage and agricultural pumping requirements. Secondly, transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, often exceeding 20% in some states, contribute significantly to the supply-demand imbalance. These losses stem from aging infrastructure, theft (especially \"kundi\" connections), and inefficiencies in the electricity grid.", "normalised": "The root causes of load shedding in India are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching. Industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) located in industrial areas like Okhla in Delhi or Peenya in Bangalore, suffer significant production losses due to disruptions in power supply. This, in turn, impacts employment and economic growth. Households, especially those dependent on electricity for water supply and lighting, experience considerable inconvenience and hardship. Students preparing for competitive exams, like the IIT-JEE or UPSC, are often affected by power outages, hindering their studies. Essential services like hospitals and transportation systems also face disruptions, potentially jeopardizing public safety. For instance, prolonged power outages at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) can have dire consequences for patients relying on critical medical equipment.", "normalised": "The consequences of load shedding are far-reaching.

{"unnormalised": "Efforts to mitigate load shedding in India include investments in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, improvements in transmission and distribution infrastructure under schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), and demand-side management initiatives to promote energy conservation.

{"unnormalised": "The agricultural sector, heavily reliant on subsidized electricity for irrigation, also contributes to peak demand. Policy interventions aimed at promoting efficient irrigation practices and adopting solar-powered pumps are essential. On 15/08/1947, India embarked on a journey of self-reliance, and ensuring energy security is paramount to achieving that vision. The financial health of State Electricity Boards (SEBs) is also a critical factor. Many SEBs are burdened with accumulated losses, hindering their ability to invest in infrastructure upgrades and purchase electricity. Addressing these financial challenges through tariff reforms and improved operational efficiency is crucial.", "normalised": "The agricultural sector, heavily reliant on subsidized electricity for irrigation, also contributes to peak demand.
