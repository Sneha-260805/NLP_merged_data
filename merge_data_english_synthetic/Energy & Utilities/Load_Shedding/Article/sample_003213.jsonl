{"unnormalised": "Basically, load shedding, also known as planned outages, happens when the demand for electricity is way higher than what the power company, like Tata Power or BSES, can actually supply. Think of it like this: everyone in your building decides to run their ACs full blast at the same time, AND switch on their geysers. The system overloads, and to prevent a total collapse of the grid, they strategically cut power to certain areas. It's like a controlled blackout, designed to save the whole shebang.", "normalised": "Basically, load shedding, also known as planned outages, happens when the demand for electricity is way higher than what the power company, like Tata Power or B S E S, can actually supply.

{"unnormalised": "Why does this happen, especially in a developing nation like India? Well, a bunch of reasons. Sometimes, it's due to old and creaky infrastructure. Power plants need regular maintenance, and transmission lines covering hundreds of km can be prone to faults. Also, demand is just skyrocketing! More people buying electronics, more industries setting up shop (requiring HUGE amounts of power), and let's be honest, we all love our ACs, right? Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi explained in a recent seminar that the power grid needs significant upgrades to handle the current load.", "normalised": "Why does this happen, especially in a developing nation like India?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole issue of power theft. People bypassing meters, connecting directly to the grid illegally...it's a big problem that puts a strain on the honest consumers. It's like stealing Rs. 100 from your neighbor - it might not seem like much, but when everyone does it, it adds up!", "normalised": "Then there's the whole issue of power theft.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? Well, for starters, we can be mindful of our energy consumption. Switch off lights when we leave a room. Use energy-efficient appliances. Invest in solar panels if you can afford it - even a small installation on your rooftop can make a difference. Plus, we need to hold our power companies accountable. They need to invest in better infrastructure, reduce transmission losses, and crack down on power theft. Maybe even offer some incentives for those using less than a certain amount of power, like a discount of Rs. 50 per month.", "normalised": "So, what can we do?

{"unnormalised": "It's not just about the inconvenience of being without power for a few hours. Load shedding affects businesses, hospitals, and even things like water supply. Imagine a small tailor in a village in Rajasthan who can't run his sewing machine because of load shedding. He loses income. Think about the impact on a hospital operating theater.

{"unnormalised": "The government is pushing renewable energy hard, and that's great. More solar parks, wind farms popping up – that's the way forward. But we also need to fix the distribution network, improve grid stability, and make sure everyone has access to reliable and affordable electricity. Building a 5000 sq ft shopping mall is useless if it can't even stay lit! Let's hope we can kick load shedding to the curb soon, and say goodbye to those unexpected power cuts forever!", "normalised": "The government is pushing renewable energy hard, and that's great.
