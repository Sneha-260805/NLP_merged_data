{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, for those lucky enough to have escaped its clutches, is basically when the power company deliberately cuts off electricity to certain areas for a set amount of time. Why? Usually, it's because demand is higher than supply, especially during those scorching Delhi summers when everyone's blasting their ACs at full power. Think of it like this: you're making biryani for a big Onam feast, but you don't have enough rice. You gotta ration it out, right? That's load shedding in a nutshell.", "normalised": "Load shedding, for those lucky enough to have escaped its clutches, is basically when the power company deliberately cuts off electricity to certain areas for a set amount of time.

{"unnormalised": "In places like Patna and smaller towns in UP, load shedding is a regular part of life, almost as predictable as the 6:00 PM chai. We're talking scheduled outages lasting anywhere from 2 hours to even 6-8 hours sometimes! Imagine trying to study for your engineering entrance exam with no electricity. My cousin, Priya, faced exactly that situation last year. She eventually had to move to her aunt's place in Bangalore just to get decent study time.", "normalised": "In places like Patna and smaller towns in U P, load shedding is a regular part of life, almost as predictable as the six zero zero P M chai.

Improving transmission and distribution networks to reduce losses is also crucial.

Let's hope for a brighter future, powered by reliable and consistent electricity.", "normalised": "We need a multi-pronged approach that involves government policies, technological advancements, and even individual responsibility – like switching off those lights when you're not using them.
