{"unnormalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate shutdown of electricity supply to certain areas, remains a persistent issue confronting India's energy and utilities sector. Despite significant strides in power generation capacity over the past decade, the demand for electricity continues to outpace supply, particularly during peak hours and periods of extreme weather. This imbalance necessitates load shedding to prevent widespread grid instability and potential blackouts.", "normalised": "Load shedding, the deliberate shutdown of electricity supply to certain areas, remains a persistent issue confronting India's energy and utilities sector.

{"unnormalised": "The causes of load shedding are multifaceted. Insufficient generation capacity, especially renewable energy sources like solar not performing consistently during monsoon season, plays a significant role. Outdated transmission and distribution infrastructure also contributes, with substantial power losses occurring during transmission across vast distances. Consider, for instance, the challenges of delivering power from a solar farm in Rajasthan to a bustling metropolis like Mumbai, a distance of over 1200 km.", "normalised": "The causes of load shedding are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, inefficient energy consumption practices and electricity theft, particularly in rural areas, exacerbate the problem. State Electricity Boards (SEBs), often burdened with financial constraints and operational inefficiencies, struggle to effectively manage supply and demand. The reliance on coal-fired power plants, while providing a stable base load, adds to environmental concerns and makes the system vulnerable to coal supply disruptions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inefficient energy consumption practices and electricity theft, particularly in rural areas, exacerbate the problem.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of load shedding is pervasive, affecting various sectors of the Indian economy. Industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), suffer significant production losses due to power outages. Agriculture, heavily reliant on electricity for irrigation pumps, faces challenges in ensuring timely crop watering, potentially impacting yields. Hospitals and essential services are forced to rely on expensive backup generators, adding to operational costs. Even something as simple as preparing a festive meal like biryani for Eid can be disrupted by unscheduled power cuts.", "normalised": "The impact of load shedding is pervasive, affecting various sectors of the Indian economy.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India is actively working to address load shedding through various initiatives. These include investing in renewable energy sources, upgrading transmission and distribution networks under schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), and promoting energy efficiency through programs like the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme. Implementing smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is also crucial for improving grid management and reducing electricity theft. Moreover, initiatives promoting energy conservation among consumers and industries are paramount. A recent report by NITI Aayog estimates that investments of Rs. 3 trillion are needed over the next five years to fully modernize India's electricity infrastructure and eliminate load shedding. Resolving this issue requires a concerted effort from policymakers, utilities, and consumers alike.", "normalised": "The Government of India is actively working to address load shedding through various initiatives.
