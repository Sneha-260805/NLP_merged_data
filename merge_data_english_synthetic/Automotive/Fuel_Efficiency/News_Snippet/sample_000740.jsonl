Initiatives like promoting the use of flex-fuel engines and investing in R&D for electric vehicles are also underway. The government offers subsidies and tax benefits on EVs, hoping to encourage faster adoption. Experts believe that consumer awareness campaigns highlighting the long-term savings (in Rs.) on fuel and the environmental benefits are crucial. Even small improvements in vehicle design, such as reducing aerodynamic drag or using lower rolling resistance tires, can collectively make a big difference. Furthermore, optimized urban planning, reducing traffic congestion in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, will also contribute to improved fuel consumption on a national scale, alongside initiatives promoting efficient driving habits like regular vehicle maintenance and avoiding unnecessary acceleration in densely populated areas and in residential areas such as 500 sq ft blocks.", "normalised": "The Automotive Research Association of India (A R A I) is working to implement stricter fuel efficiency norms, aiming for a phased reduction in C O two emissions.
