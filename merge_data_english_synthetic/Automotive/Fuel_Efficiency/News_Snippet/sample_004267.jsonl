The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is expected to release updated star ratings for vehicles by the end of the year. Experts predict that upcoming BS-VI phase II emission norms will further encourage manufacturers to innovate. This may even include exploring alternative fuels like CNG and Ethanol.", "normalised": "The government is also pushing for stricter fuel efficiency norms.

Even small changes, like avoiding aggressive acceleration, can translate to savings of several Rs. per month. Ultimately, smart driving combined with efficient vehicles is the key to saving money and reducing emissions in India's rapidly growing automotive market. A recent survey showed that consumers prefer to pay extra Rs. 20,000 for fuel-efficient models, even if it means settling for a slightly smaller car with a boot space of 300 litres.", "normalised": "Beyond engine technology, optimizing driving habits and ensuring proper tire inflation are also crucial for maximizing fuel efficiency.
