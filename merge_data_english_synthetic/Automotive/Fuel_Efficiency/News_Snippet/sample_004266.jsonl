They advise regular vehicle maintenance and eco-driving habits to maximize fuel savings. Moreover, the rising fuel prices (Rs. 106/litre) are encouraging consumers to prioritize fuel efficiency, impacting buying decisions. Consumers are also looking into alternate fuel sources like CNG to cut costs. A recent survey indicated that buyers in metropolitan cities are even willing to compromise on car size (reducing parking footprint from say 150 sq ft to 120 sq ft) to achieve better mileage.", "normalised": "However, experts caution that real-world conditions in cities like Mumbai, with heavy traffic and stop-and-go driving, can significantly impact these numbers.
