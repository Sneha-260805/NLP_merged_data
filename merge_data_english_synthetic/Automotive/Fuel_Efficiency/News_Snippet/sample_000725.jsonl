The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is actively working on developing new testing standards that more accurately reflect real-world driving conditions in India, considering factors like traffic congestion in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore. Even something as simple as reducing unnecessary weight in the car’s boot – for example, removing unused tools or extra luggage taking up valuable space of even just 2 sq ft – can noticeably improve mileage. Consumers are urged to consult their owner's manuals for specific fuel-saving tips related to their vehicle models.", "normalised": "Experts suggest that maintaining proper tire inflation, regularly servicing the vehicle, and opting for smaller engines can also save rupees thousands annually.
