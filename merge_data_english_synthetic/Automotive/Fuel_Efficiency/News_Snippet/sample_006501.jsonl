Analysts predict a surge in demand for vehicles exceeding 25 kmpl, especially in urban areas like Bangalore and Chennai, where traffic congestion significantly impacts fuel consumption. The Government of India's push for electric vehicles (EVs) also plays a role, incentivizing hybrid and EV adoption. Consumers are increasingly aware of the long-term cost benefits, despite higher initial investments. Efficient car design, even optimizing features like tire pressure and reducing vehicle weight by a few kilograms, can contribute substantially to fuel savings. Homes with covered parking areas are increasingly common in new housing societies, offering additional sq ft that can affect fuel consumption.", "normalised": "Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra are showcasing models boasting increased kilometers per liter (kilometers per liter) at the upcoming Auto Expo in Pragati Maidan.
