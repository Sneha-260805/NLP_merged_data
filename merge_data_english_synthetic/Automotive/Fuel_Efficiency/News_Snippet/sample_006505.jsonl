Consider a test drive on your usual route before purchasing. Investing in a BS6 compliant vehicle also contributes to better fuel economy. Beyond individual effort, adopting carpooling and public transport can further reduce fuel consumption and traffic congestion in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore. Some new vehicles boast impressive mileage - even exceeding 25 kmpl in certain conditions. Remember, saving fuel also saves Rs.!", "normalised": "The A R A I (Automotive Research Association of India) conducts fuel efficiency tests. However, real-world figures often differ.
