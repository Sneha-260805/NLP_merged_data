Remember that your grandmother’s advice about driving smoothly still holds true! Considering the large population and sprawling cities of India, even slight improvements can dramatically reduce overall emissions. Efficient urban planning, including creating more green spaces exceeding 10,000 sq ft, is also a key component of a greener future.", "normalised": "Even seemingly small changes, like reducing idling time and removing unnecessary weight (for example, rooftop carriers), can make a difference.
