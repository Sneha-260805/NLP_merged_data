Even subtle changes, like removing unnecessary items from your car boot (avoiding extra 50 kg weight) or ensuring your tyres are properly inflated, can improve mileage. Look for cars with a higher ARAI rating. Remember, fuel efficiency is not just about saving money; it’s about being environmentally responsible. A small increase in fuel efficiency per car, multiplied by millions of vehicles across India's bustling cities (like Mumbai, Chennai, or Kolkata) covering millions of sq ft, translates to substantial fuel savings nationwide.", "normalised": "Choosing a car with good fuel efficiency can also significantly reduce your carbon footprint, contributing to a cleaner environment.
