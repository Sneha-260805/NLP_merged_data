Investing in fuel-efficient vehicles not only saves money but also reduces carbon footprint, contributing to a cleaner India. Consider fuel efficiency ratings when purchasing your next car. A slight increase can save you a substantial amount of money over the lifetime of the vehicle, perhaps enough to buy that extra 500 sq ft of land in your native village.", "normalised": "Experts suggest that further gains can be achieved through widespread adoption of hybrid and electric technologies, alongside infrastructural improvements like well-maintained roads.
