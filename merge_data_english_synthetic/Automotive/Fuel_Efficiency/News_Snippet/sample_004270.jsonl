Moreover, advancements in materials science are leading to lighter vehicles, further boosting fuel economy. Even traditional Maruti Suzuki models are incorporating technologies previously seen only in premium brands. Experts predict that optimizing driving habits, such as maintaining consistent speeds on highways like the Yamuna Expressway, can also significantly impact fuel consumption, potentially saving thousands of Rs. annually. Ultimately, fuel efficiency is no longer just a selling point; it's becoming a necessity for the average Indian family, especially considering the rising cost of living and limited parking space (often smaller than 150 sq ft) in metro cities.", "normalised": "This trend is also fueled by government initiatives promoting C N G and electric vehicles, alongside stricter emission norms.
