The government offers subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. Saving fuel saves Rs. and contributes to a cleaner environment – a win-win for everyone. A well-maintained parking spot of 150 sq ft can prevent dings that lead to future repairs impacting efficiency. Remember, even small adjustments in driving habits can make a significant difference, potentially adding several km per liter.", "normalised": "Beyond personal vehicles, initiatives are underway to promote ethanol-blended petrol, aiming to reduce India's dependence on imported crude oil.
