Even small changes, like reducing unnecessary weight in the car (Rs. 200 worth of old newspapers), can impact fuel economy. Ultimately, improved fuel efficiency not only saves consumers money but also contributes to a greener environment, benefiting communities from Kerala to Kashmir and reducing our reliance on imported oil. It's a win-win. The new Tata plant occupies 500,000 sq ft.", "normalised": "Consumer awareness campaigns by organizations like A R A I (Automotive Research Association of India) are helping educate drivers on fuel-saving techniques, such as maintaining optimal tire pressure and avoiding aggressive acceleration.
