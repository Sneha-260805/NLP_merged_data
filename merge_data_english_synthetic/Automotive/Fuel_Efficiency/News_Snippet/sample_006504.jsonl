Consumers are also advised to maintain their vehicles properly; regular servicing, correct tyre pressure (as per manufacturer recommendations), and avoiding aggressive driving can significantly impact fuel consumption. Even clearing out unnecessary items in the car (reducing weight) can help. Remember, saving fuel saves you Rs. and reduces emissions, benefiting both your wallet and the environment. Carpooling, especially in congested cities like Mumbai, also contributes to lowered fuel consumption and eases traffic on our roads. Even small changes like using smaller parking spaces of 100 sq ft help.", "normalised": "Furthermore, tyre manufacturers like M R F are developing low rolling resistance tyres, claiming improvements of around three to five kilometer per liter.
