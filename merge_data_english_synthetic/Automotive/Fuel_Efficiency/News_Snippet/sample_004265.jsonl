Maintaining recommended tyre pressure, often found on a sticker inside the driver's side door, can improve mileage by up to 3%. Removing unnecessary weight from the car, even a mere 50 kg, helps.", "normalised": "Aggressive acceleration and braking can drastically reduce efficiency.

A car parked in direct sunlight, with AC blasting full power, can consume significantly more fuel initially. Always strive for smooth driving, avoid peak hour traffic where possible, and consider lighter alternatives to SUVs if practicality allows. The cost savings over time, measured in Rs., can be substantial. Regularly servicing your vehicle also helps in optimizing the engine and thereby, fuel efficiency. The average Indian family buys a 1200 sq ft flat - fuel efficiency is essential for related long distance drives.", "normalised": "Manufacturers are employing various technologies like regenerative braking and improved aerodynamics.
