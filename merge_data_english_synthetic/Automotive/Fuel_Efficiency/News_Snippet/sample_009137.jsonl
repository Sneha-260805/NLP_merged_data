{"unnormalised": "The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) recently conducted tests showing significant improvements in the fuel efficiency of several popular models. Compact SUVs, traditionally known for lower mileage, are now boasting figures comparable to smaller hatchbacks. Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra are leading the charge with new technologies like hybrid powertrains and advanced aerodynamics.", "normalised": "The Automotive Research Association of India (A R A I) recently conducted tests showing significant improvements in the fuel efficiency of several popular models.

{"unnormalised": "Industry analysts predict that demand for fuel-efficient vehicles will continue to grow, particularly in price-sensitive markets like India. This trend is also driving research into alternative fuels and electric vehicle technology. Consumers are also looking for features like start-stop systems and eco-driving modes to maximize their fuel savings. Reducing vehicle weight by just a few kilograms can also contribute to noticeable gains, further incentivizing manufacturers to innovate in material science. Even small changes, like improved tire rolling resistance, can have a big impact. Some showrooms offer discounts of Rs. 5,000 for vehicles surpassing certain fuel efficiency benchmarks. The average Indian driver covering 1,000 km a month can save significantly with a more fuel-efficient car. Even parking spaces are becoming more compact, averaging around 120 sq ft, reflecting the popularity of smaller, fuel-efficient models.", "normalised": "Industry analysts predict that demand for fuel-efficient vehicles will continue to grow, particularly in price-sensitive markets like India.
