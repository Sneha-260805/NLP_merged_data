Maruti Suzuki announced plans to expand its CNG vehicle offerings, targeting middle-class families in cities like Jaipur and Lucknow. Analysts estimate fuel savings of up to Rs. 10,000 annually for commuters switching to more fuel-efficient cars covering approximately 15,000 km. This shift could also incentivize investment in smaller, more efficient engines displacing larger engine types, ultimately reducing the environmental footprint of the automotive sector, whose infrastructure footprint can involve spaces of 10,000 sq ft or more.", "normalised": "In related news, A R A I (Automotive Research Association of India) is reportedly set to introduce more stringent fuel efficiency standards by two thousand and twenty five.
