Regular servicing, including air filter replacement, is also vital. Many manufacturers now offer cars with features like start-stop technology and regenerative braking to further enhance efficiency. Investing in a smaller, lighter vehicle, if your needs allow, can offer significant savings at the pump. Even seemingly small changes, like ensuring your car isn't parked idling for extended periods, add up over time. Consider carpooling or using public transport where feasible. Newer models often display real-time fuel consumption data, allowing drivers to adjust their behaviour for better results. Rs. saved per km adds up over the years! Choosing a smaller parking spot (say, one of 100 sq ft.) over a larger one can be a small way to help reduce fuel consumption while maneuvering.", "normalised": "Furthermore, minimizing unnecessary weight in the car, like removing extra luggage, can positively impact fuel consumption.
