Dr. Anjali Sharma, a professor at IIT Madras specializing in automotive engineering, emphasizes that even small improvements can lead to significant savings. “Consider a family driving 15,000 km annually. Improving fuel efficiency from 15 km per litre to 20 km per litre could save them Rs. 25,000 a year, assuming petrol costs Rs. 100 per litre,\" she explains.", "normalised": "New Delhi: With rising fuel prices, fuel efficiency is becoming a key purchase driver for Indian car buyers.

Maruti Suzuki, for example, is promoting its CNG models as a fuel-efficient alternative, especially in cities like Mumbai where traffic congestion is high. Government initiatives like the Bharat Stage VI emission norms are also indirectly contributing by pushing automakers to adopt cleaner and more fuel-efficient technologies. Even small improvements, such as reducing vehicle weight by 50 kg, can have a measurable impact on fuel economy. This is crucial in a market where space is also valued, with families often preferring compact cars that occupy less than 150 sq ft of parking space.", "normalised": "Manufacturers are responding with innovations like lighter materials and more efficient engine designs.
