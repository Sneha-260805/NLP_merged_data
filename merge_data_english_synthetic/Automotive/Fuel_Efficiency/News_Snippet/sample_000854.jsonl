Driving habits, such as aggressive acceleration and frequent braking in congested cities like Delhi, significantly impact efficiency. Regular maintenance, including tire pressure checks and timely engine servicing at workshops like Sharma Motors, also plays a vital role.", "normalised": "Several factors influence a vehicle's fuel consumption.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government's Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms have pushed manufacturers to develop more fuel-efficient engines. Before purchasing, compare models and consider factors like engine size and vehicle weight. Remember, a heavier SUV will generally consume more fuel than a smaller hatchback, even if both are BS VI compliant. Small changes can result in significant savings, potentially saving you Rs. 5000 or more annually. Improving your car's efficiency also minimizes your carbon footprint, contributing to a greener India. A well-maintained garage of just 200 sq ft can become an important space to ensure proper car upkeep.", "normalised": "The Indian government's Bharat Stage six (B S six) emission norms have pushed manufacturers to develop more fuel-efficient engines.
