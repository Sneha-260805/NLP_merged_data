A recent survey in Mumbai revealed that 70% of respondents consider mileage a crucial factor when purchasing a new car. With rising fuel prices (Rs. 110/liter in some areas), even a small improvement in efficiency can translate to substantial savings for the average driver covering 1500 km monthly. This translates to savings on parking spots that require 150 sq ft of space on average.", "normalised": "Consumers are increasingly aware of the long-term savings associated with fuel-efficient vehicles.
