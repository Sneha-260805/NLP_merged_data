Choosing lighter vehicles, where feasible, can also positively impact fuel consumption. The study further highlighted the importance of aerodynamic design; manufacturers are increasingly focusing on this, even incorporating features like active grille shutters to reduce drag and improve fuel economy.", "normalised": "Furthermore, regular vehicle maintenance, including air filter replacements and engine tuning, plays a crucial role.
