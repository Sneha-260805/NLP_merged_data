{"unnormalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues? I do the usual stuff – tyre pressure is on point, air filter’s relatively clean. Could it be the new \"premium\" petrol the petrol pump guy keeps trying to sell me? He claims it’s like \"Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year\" level stuff, increases mileage by 5 kmpl. Sounds like bunkum to me.", "normalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues? I do the usual stuff – tire pressure is on point, air filter’s relatively clean.

Open to suggestions! Maybe some good, honest mechanics around Bangalore? Budget is kinda tight after all the festival expenses - Diwali hit the wallet hard, man. Any advice appreciated!", "normalised": "Thinking maybe I should take it to an authorized Maruti service center?
