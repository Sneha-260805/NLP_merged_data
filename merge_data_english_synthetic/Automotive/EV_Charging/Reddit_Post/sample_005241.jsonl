{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 (Slowest):** A standard 15A/5A socket you'd find at home, like the one you use for your washing machine. Great for topping up, but a full charge can take ages, think 24+ hrs for a large battery. Good for overnight charging in places like Bangalore.", "normalised": "*   **Level one (Slowest):** A standard fifteen ampere slash five ampere socket you'd find at home, like the one you use for your washing machine. Great for topping up, but a full charge can take ages, think twenty four plus hours for a large battery. Good for overnight charging in places like Bangalore."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2 (Faster):** Requires a dedicated charger installed at home (or at a public charging station). This offers significantly faster charging, maybe 6-8 hrs for a full charge. Think Ather Grid or Tata Power EZ Charge. Costs around Rs. 20,000-Rs. 60,000 for the charger + installation.", "normalised": "*   **Level two (Faster):** Requires a dedicated charger installed at home (or at a public charging station).

{"unnormalised": "*   **DC Fast Charging (Fastest):** These are the big guns, usually found at public charging stations along highways (Delhi-Chandigarh routes are getting plenty). They can deliver a substantial charge in a short amount of time (30-60 mins for 80% charge).
