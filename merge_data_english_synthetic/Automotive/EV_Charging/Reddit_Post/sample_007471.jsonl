{"unnormalised": "First off, understand your charging levels. You've got Level 1 (slow, like charging your phone overnight – typically 2-3 km per hour) using a regular household socket. Level 2 (more common, often found at malls or residential complexes – 15-20 km per hour) needs a dedicated charging point installed. Then there's DC Fast Charging (the \"Dhoom\" style – boosting your range significantly in a shorter time, think 80% charge in 30-45 mins), usually found along highways.", "normalised": "First off, understand your charging levels.
