{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1:** Your standard 120V/15A home outlet. Slowest, like charging your phone overnight. Good for topping off a small charge, adding maybe 50-60 km range overnight.", "normalised": "*   **Level one:** Your standard one hundred and twenty volt/fifteen ampere home outlet. Slowest, like charging your phone overnight. Good for topping off a small charge, adding maybe fifty to sixty kilometer range overnight."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2:** Think 240V/32A, similar to what you might use for an AC. Gives you a full charge much faster, adding around 30-40 km of range per hour. You'll likely need a professional electrician (think Mishra Electricals in your colony) to install this.", "normalised": "*   **Level two:** Think two hundred and forty volt/thirty two ampere, similar to what you might use for an A C.
