{"unnormalised": "1.  **Slow Charging (AC):** This is your standard home charger, like the one you might install in your apartment complex in Bandra. Think a regular 220V outlet, giving you around 10-15 km of range per hour. Good for overnight top-ups, like charging after a long drive back from Lonavala.", "normalised": "one. **Slow Charging (A C):** This is your standard home charger, like the one you might install in your apartment complex in Bandra. Think a regular two hundred and twenty volt outlet, giving you around ten to fifteen kilometer of range per hour. Good for overnight top-ups, like charging after a long drive back from Lonavala."}
{"unnormalised": "2.  **Fast Charging (AC):** These are often found in malls or office parking lots. They use a higher voltage AC current and can provide 50-70 km of range per hour.
