{"unnormalised": "First, understand the charging levels: Level 1 is basically plugging into a standard household socket (like charging your phone, but slower). Think overnight charging at your home in, say, Chembur. Level 2 requires a dedicated charger (like a wallbox) and gives you significantly faster charging. Think installing one at your parking spot in your building complex, maybe costing around Rs. 25,000 installed.", "normalised": "First, understand the charging levels: Level one is basically plugging into a standard household socket (like charging your phone, but slower).

{"unnormalised": "Range anxiety is real, especially in a country where you might need to unexpectedly detour to a family wedding in Mathura! So, plan your routes, use apps that show charging station locations, and remember that real-world range can vary based on driving style and conditions. Institutions like IIT Madras are doing fantastic research on battery tech, so expect even better performance in the future.", "normalised": "Range anxiety is real, especially in a country where you might need to unexpectedly detour to a family wedding in Mathura!
