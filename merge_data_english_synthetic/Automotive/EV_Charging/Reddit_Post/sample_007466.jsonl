{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 (Slowest):** This is your standard 15A socket at home, like the one you use for your washing machine.

{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2 (Moderate):** Requires a dedicated charger installed in your home or workplace. Adds around 25-30 km of range per hour. Faster and more convenient than Level 1.

{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 3 (Fastest):** Also known as DC fast charging. Found at public charging stations. Can add significant range (80% charge) in 30-60 minutes, depending on the car's battery capacity.
