{"unnormalised": "First, understand the levels. Level 1 charging is your standard household 230V outlet, like the one you use for your washing machine. It's slow, adding maybe 4-5 km of range per hour. Good for overnight top-ups, but not much else. Level 2 charging uses a dedicated 240V circuit (like for ACs). This gets you closer to 25-35 km per hour. Many homes in Bangalore and Pune are installing these. Level 3, or DC Fast Charging, is where the magic happens. These stations can add significant range (80% charge) in 30-60 minutes. You'll find them at highway rest stops and some public charging hubs.", "normalised": "First, understand the levels. Level one charging is your standard household two hundred and thirty volt outlet, like the one you use for your washing machine. It's slow, adding maybe four to five kilometer of range per hour. Good for overnight top-ups, but not much else. Level two charging uses a dedicated two hundred and forty volt circuit (like for A C s). This gets you closer to twenty five to thirty five kilometer per hour. Many homes in Bangalore and Pune are installing these. Level three, or D C Fast Charging, is where the magic happens. These stations can add significant range (eighty percent charge) in thirty to sixty minutes. You'll find them at highway rest stops and some public charging hubs."}
