{"unnormalised": "There are primarily three levels:", "normalised": "There are primarily three levels:"}
{"unnormalised": "1. **Level 1 (Slow like a bullock cart):** This is just plugging into a standard 120V (or 230V in India) household outlet. Expect a measly 5-8 km of range per hour of charging. Good for topping up, but painfully slow for a full charge, maybe useful only for a small e-scooter or overnight for minimal daily commute.", "normalised": "one. **Level one (Slow like a bullock cart):** This is just plugging into a standard one hundred and twenty volt (or two hundred and thirty volt in India) household outlet. Expect a measly five to eight kilometer of range per hour of charging. Good for topping up, but painfully slow for a full charge, maybe useful only for a small e-scooter or overnight for minimal daily commute."}
{"unnormalised": "2. **Level 2 (Amma's Tadka):** Requires a dedicated 240V circuit and a charging station (wallbox). Think 20-50 km of range per hour. Much more practical for daily use. You'll often find these at malls, apartments (if your society is progressive like a Dharma Production film!), and workplaces. Costs vary - from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 80,000 for the unit and installation.", "normalised": "two. **Level two (Amma's Tadka):** Requires a dedicated two hundred and forty volt circuit and a charging station (wallbox). Think twenty to fifty kilometer of range per hour. Much more practical for daily use. You'll often find these at malls, apartments (if your society is progressive like a Dharma Production film!), and workplaces. Costs vary - from rupee twenty thousand to rupee eighty thousand for the unit and installation."}
{"unnormalised": "3. **DC Fast Charging (Rajdhani Express):** The big guns! These offer rapid charging, adding 100-300+ km of range in an hour. You'll find these at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. Perfect for long journeys, like Delhi to Agra. But remember, frequent fast charging can potentially impact battery life over the long term. Cost per unit is highest here.", "normalised": "three. **D C Fast Charging (Rajdhani Express):** The big guns!
