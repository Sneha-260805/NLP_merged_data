{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand your charging levels. Level 1 is your basic household outlet – slow, but good for overnight trickle charging, adding maybe 5-6 km of range per hour. Level 2, often found at public charging stations or you can install at home (Rs. 20,000- Rs. 50,000 approx.), is faster, adding around 25-35 km per hour. Then there's DC Fast Charging, found primarily on highways. Think Mumbai-Pune Expressway where you get 80% charge in ~30-45 mins.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand your charging levels.
