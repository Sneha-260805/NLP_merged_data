{"unnormalised": "First, understand the charging levels. Level 1 is your basic 120V (not really used here due to our 230V) and Level 2 is what you'd usually install at home – a 230V wall-mounted charger. Expect around 20-40km range per hour of charge. Think overnight charging while you binge-watch a classic like Sholay.", "normalised": "First, understand the charging levels. Level one is your basic one hundred and twenty volt not really used here due to our two hundred and thirty volt and Level two is what you'd usually install at home – a two hundred and thirty volt wall-mounted charger. Expect around twenty to forty kilometer range per hour of charge. Think overnight charging while you binge-watch a classic like Sholay."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's DC Fast Charging (Level 3). These are those public charging stations you see popping up near dhabas and in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. These can give you a significant boost in a short time – maybe 80% charge in 30-60 minutes, depending on the car and charger's capabilities. Great for that quick top-up before a road trip to Manali.", "normalised": "Then there's D C Fast Charging Level three.
