{"unnormalised": "First off, understand the different LEVELS. Level 1 is basically plugging into a standard 120V (US Standard, in India it's 230V) outlet - think of it like charging your phone, but much slower. It can take 12-24 hours to fully charge a car. Level 2 charging uses a 240V outlet (or a dedicated charger) and is significantly faster, think 4-6 hours for a full charge. Then there's DC fast charging (Level 3), which can give you a significant boost in a very short time - maybe 30 mins for 80% charge. Think of that iconic car scene from Dhoom, but instead of nitro, it's electrons!", "normalised": "First off, understand the different LEVELS. Level one is basically plugging into a standard one hundred and twenty volt (U S Standard, in India it's two hundred and thirty volt) outlet - think of it like charging your phone, but much slower. It can take twelve to twenty four hours to fully charge a car. Level two charging uses a two hundred and forty volt outlet (or a dedicated charger) and is significantly faster, think four to six hours for a full charge. Then there's D C fast charging (Level three), which can give you a significant boost in a very short time - maybe thirty minutes for eighty percent charge.
