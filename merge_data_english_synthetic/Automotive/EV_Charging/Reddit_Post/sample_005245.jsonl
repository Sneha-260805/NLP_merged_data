{"unnormalised": "First, understand your charging levels. Level 1 is basically plugging into a regular 230V wall socket - think charging your phone, but much slower. Expect maybe 4-5 km of range per hour. Level 2 uses a dedicated charging station (often found at malls or public charging points) and offers significantly faster charging, around 25-35 km per hour. Level 3, or DC fast charging, is the fastest, potentially adding hundreds of km of range in an hour, like recharging at a petrol pump. These are usually offered by companies like Tata Power or ChargeZone.", "normalised": "First, understand your charging levels.

{"unnormalised": "Think about charging at home. Installing a Level 2 charger is like upgrading from a local dhaba to a five-star hotel - a significant improvement! Check if your apartment complex (like the ones in Gurgaon) allows it, and what approvals are needed. Many institutions like IIT Delhi are researching grid integration for EVs, so future charging infrastructure should become even smarter.", "normalised": "Think about charging at home.

Don't always charge to 100%; 80-90% is usually sufficient for daily commutes.", "normalised": "Remember that ambient temperature affects charging.
