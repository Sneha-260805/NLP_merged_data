{"unnormalised": "First, understand the charging levels. Level 1 is your standard 120V (in the US) or 230V (in India) wall outlet. It's slow, adding maybe 5-8 km of range per hour. Think of it as a trickle charge, good for overnight top-ups if you’re driving shorter distances, like your daily commute to Nariman Point.", "normalised": "First, understand the charging levels.

{"unnormalised": "Level 2 uses a dedicated 240V circuit (similar to your AC or geyser connection) and can add 20-50 km of range per hour. Most home chargers are Level 2.

{"unnormalised": "Consider your driving habits and charging needs. Are you primarily driving within the city, or are you planning long road trips?
