{"unnormalised": "First, understand the basics: AC vs. DC. AC (Alternating Current) is what you get from your regular wall socket at home, like the one Amma uses to charge her phone. This is used for Level 1 (very slow, trickle charging) and Level 2 charging. Think overnight charging – perfect for someone like Rajesh in Bangalore who drives 40-50 km daily. Expect charging times from 8-12 hours for a full charge using Level 2.", "normalised": "First, understand the basics: A C versus D C.

{"unnormalised": "DC (Direct Current) charging, on the other hand, is much faster. It bypasses the car's onboard charger and feeds power directly to the battery. This is what you find at public charging stations, like the ones popping up near IIT Delhi. We're talking DC Fast Charging (DCFC), and now even Ultra-Fast Charging. Depending on the charger's kW rating (50kW, 150kW, etc.) and your car's battery capacity, you could get 80% charge in under an hour!", "normalised": "D C (Direct Current) charging, on the other hand, is much faster.
