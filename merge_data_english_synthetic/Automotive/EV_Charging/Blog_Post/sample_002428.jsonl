{"unnormalised": "Firstly, there are different levels of EV charging. Level 1 charging, using a standard 15A household socket (like the one you use for your refrigerator) is the slowest, adding only about 4-5 km of range per hour. This is suitable for overnight charging if you drive relatively short distances, say within the city of Chennai.", "normalised": "Firstly, there are different levels of E V charging. Level one charging, using a standard fifteen ampere household socket (like the one you use for your refrigerator) is the slowest, adding only about four to five kilometer of range per hour. This is suitable for overnight charging if you drive relatively short distances, say within the city of Chennai."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging utilizes a dedicated charging station (often found in malls or residential complexes). These stations can deliver significantly more power, adding around 25-30 km of range per hour. This is what you'll likely find at a Tata Power charging station in Delhi or a Charge Zone location near Pune. Many gated communities and apartment buildings in Bangalore are now installing Level 2 chargers for residents.", "normalised": "Level two charging utilizes a dedicated charging station (often found in malls or residential complexes).

Many gated communities and apartment buildings in Bangalore are now installing Level two chargers for residents."}
{"unnormalised": "Then comes DC Fast Charging. This is the fastest method, allowing you to replenish a significant portion of your battery (around 80%) in as little as 30-60 minutes, depending on the charger's capacity (measured in kW) and your vehicle's capabilities. Imagine quickly charging your Mahindra XUV400 while enjoying a chai break during a road trip to Rajasthan. Companies like Ather Energy are deploying fast charging grids across India.", "normalised": "Then comes D C Fast Charging.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of charging varies depending on the provider and the charging speed. Public charging can range from Rs. 15-25 per unit (kWh). Home charging is generally cheaper, costing you only the price of electricity per unit (depending on your state's electricity board).", "normalised": "The cost of charging varies depending on the provider and the charging speed.

{"unnormalised": "Investing in a home charging setup, especially if you have access to solar power, can significantly reduce your running costs. Imagine saving money while driving your electric scooter in the green landscapes of Kerala. Many homes are installing solar panels of 1000 sq ft and above.", "normalised": "Investing in a home charging setup, especially if you have access to solar power, can significantly reduce your running costs.
