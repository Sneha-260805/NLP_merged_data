{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the charging levels. Level 1 charging is the slowest, using a standard 230V household socket. Think plugging your phone in, but slower. It might take 12-24 hours to fully charge a car from near empty – not ideal for daily commutes.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the charging levels. Level one charging is the slowest, using a standard two hundred and thirty volt household socket. Think plugging your phone in, but slower. It might take twelve to twenty four hours to fully charge a car from near empty – not ideal for daily commutes."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging uses a dedicated 230V or 400V outlet, significantly faster. You’ll often find these at homes (with a professionally installed charger), workplaces, and public charging stations. Charging time drops to 4-8 hours for a full charge. Many apartment complexes in Bangalore are now offering Level 2 charging points.", "normalised": "Level two charging uses a dedicated two hundred and thirty volt or four hundred volt outlet, significantly faster.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, we have Level 3, also known as DC Fast Charging. These are high-power chargers found at dedicated charging stations, often along highways. They can deliver a significant charge in a short amount of time – typically adding 80% charge in 30-60 minutes. This is your lifeline for long journeys like a Delhi to Jaipur drive. Remember that, unlike Level 1 and 2, Fast Charging may not be available in all EV models.", "normalised": "Finally, we have Level three, also known as D C Fast Charging.
