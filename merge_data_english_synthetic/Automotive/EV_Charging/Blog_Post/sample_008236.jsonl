But before you trade in your Maruti Suzuki for an electric Tata Nexon, understanding EV charging is crucial. Think of it like refilling petrol, but instead of a fuel pump, you have a charger.", "normalised": "The electric vehicle (E V) revolution is revving up in India, from bustling metropolises like Mumbai to serene hill stations like Shimla.

{"unnormalised": "**Level 1: Slow and Steady (Home Charging)** This uses a standard 15A socket found in most Indian homes. Imagine plugging your phone in. It’s convenient for overnight charging, adding about 4-5 km of range per hour. Ideal for those who drive relatively short distances daily, say from their home in Bandra to their office in Nariman Point.", "normalised": "**Level one: Slow and Steady (Home Charging)** This uses a standard fifteen A socket found in most Indian homes. Imagine plugging your phone in. It’s convenient for overnight charging, adding about four to five kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for those who drive relatively short distances daily, say from their home in Bandra to their office in Nariman Point."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 2: The Mid-Range Marvel (Public & Home Charging)** Level 2 chargers require a dedicated 230V circuit. They offer a significantly faster charging rate, adding approximately 25-35 km of range per hour. Many apartments in cities like Bangalore are now offering Level 2 charging points in their parking areas, often covering an area of around 100 sq ft per charging station. Companies like Ather Energy also provide home charging solutions.", "normalised": "**Level two: The Mid-Range Marvel (Public and Home Charging)** Level two chargers require a dedicated two hundred and thirty V circuit. They offer a significantly faster charging rate, adding approximately twenty five to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Many apartments in cities like Bangalore are now offering Level two charging points in their parking areas, often covering an area of around one hundred square feet per charging station. Companies like Ather Energy also provide home charging solutions."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 3: DC Fast Charging (Highway Heroes)** This is where the magic happens! DC fast chargers (also known as Level 3) are high-powered stations found along highways and in public charging hubs. They can add up to 80% charge in about 30-60 minutes. Perfect for long journeys, like driving from Delhi to Jaipur. However, these chargers require specialized infrastructure and are significantly more expensive.", "normalised": "**Level three: D C Fast Charging (Highway Heroes)** This is where the magic happens!

{"unnormalised": "**Factors affecting charging time:** Battery capacity (in kWh), charger power (in kW), and ambient temperature all play a role. Also, charging slows down as the battery approaches full capacity.", "normalised": "**Factors affecting charging time:** Battery capacity (in kilo watt hour), charger power (in kilo watt), and ambient temperature all play a role. Also, charging slows down as the battery approaches full capacity."}
{"unnormalised": "**Cost of Charging:** The cost varies depending on the electricity tariff (Rs./kWh) and whether you are charging at home or at a public charging station. Public charging stations might have usage fees on top of the electricity cost.", "normalised": "**Cost of Charging:** The cost varies depending on the electricity tariff (rupees per kilo watt hour) and whether you are charging at home or at a public charging station.

{"unnormalised": "**Future is Electric:** Institutions like IIT Madras are actively involved in research and development for advanced battery technologies and efficient charging solutions. As the EV infrastructure continues to grow, spearheaded by companies like Tata Power, EV adoption will become even more seamless. So, buckle up, because the future of driving in India is electric! Dr. Sharma from Pune University believes we'll see a dramatic increase in charging stations within the next 5 years.", "normalised": "**Future is Electric:** Institutions like I I T Madras are actively involved in research and development for advanced battery technologies and efficient charging solutions.
