{"unnormalised": "There are essentially three main levels of EV charging, each with different speeds and availability. Level 1 is the slowest, using a standard 120V AC outlet like you'd find in your home in Delhi. Think of it as trickle-charging. You might get only 4-5 km of range per hour, so it’s best for overnight charging or for smaller commutes within your local area.", "normalised": "There are essentially three main levels of E V charging, each with different speeds and availability. Level one is the slowest, using a standard one hundred and twenty volt A C outlet like you'd find in your home in Delhi. Think of it as trickle-charging. You might get only four to five kilometer of range per hour, so it’s best for overnight charging or for smaller commutes within your local area."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging is faster, typically using a 240V AC outlet. This is what most folks install at their homes or what you might find at public charging stations in places like Bangalore or near IIT Bombay. You can expect around 20-30 km of range per hour. Many residential complexes are now offering Level 2 charging points in designated parking areas of around 1000 sq ft.", "normalised": "Level two charging is faster, typically using a two hundred and forty volt A C outlet. This is what most folks install at their homes or what you might find at public charging stations in places like Bangalore or near I I T Bombay. You can expect around twenty to thirty kilometer of range per hour. Many residential complexes are now offering Level two charging points in designated parking areas of around one thousand square feet."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, Level 3 or DC Fast Charging (DCFC) is the speed demon. These chargers are often found along highways, at petrol pumps converted to charging stations, or in commercial areas. They use DC power directly to the battery, bypassing the car’s onboard charger, and can add significant range in a short time – often 100+ km in 30 minutes.", "normalised": "Finally, Level three or D C Fast Charging (D C F C) is the speed demon.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, charging speed also depends on your car's battery capacity and charging capabilities.

{"unnormalised": "Public charging infrastructure is still developing in India. Apps like PlugShare and ElectriPe can help you locate charging stations. Costs vary widely; some are pay-per-use (Rs. 15-25 per kWh), while others offer subscription plans. Dr. Sharma, a researcher at IISc, is studying the feasibility of solar-powered EV charging stations to reduce electricity costs.", "normalised": "Public charging infrastructure is still developing in India.
