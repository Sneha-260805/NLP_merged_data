{"unnormalised": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are slowly but surely making their presence felt on Indian roads, from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene hills of Shimla. But alongside the excitement of a cleaner ride comes the essential question: how do you charge them? Let’s break down EV charging in a way that’s easy for everyone, even your Uncle Sharma who's only ever driven a Maruti 800.", "normalised": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are slowly but surely making their presence felt on Indian roads, from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene hills of Shimla.

{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 Charging:** This is your basic home charging, using a standard 15A plug point, like the one you use for your refrigerator. It's the slowest option, adding around 4-8 km of range per hour. Think of it as overnight trickle charging. Perfect for topping up after a short commute around Delhi. You could easily set it up at your home, like at 10:00 PM after a long day.", "normalised": "*   **Level one Charging:** This is your basic home charging, using a standard fifteen ampere plug point, like the one you use for your refrigerator. It's the slowest option, adding around four to eight kilometer of range per hour. Think of it as overnight trickle charging. Perfect for topping up after a short commute around Delhi. You could easily set it up at your home, like at ten p m after a long day."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2 Charging:** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It uses a 3.3kW or 7.2kW charger, significantly faster than Level 1. You can expect around 20-40 km of range per hour. Many apartments in Bengaluru are now offering these as standard amenities. This level is ideal if you need a good charge before that long weekend trip to Goa.", "normalised": "*   **Level two Charging:** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It uses a three point three kilowatt or seven point two kilowatt charger, significantly faster than Level one. You can expect around twenty to forty kilometer of range per hour. Many apartments in Bengaluru are now offering these as standard amenities. This level is ideal if you need a good charge before that long weekend trip to Goa."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **DC Fast Charging:** This is the fastest option, often found at public charging stations along highways. These chargers can add significant range (80% in under an hour, depending on the car) at a rate of 100+ km of range per hour. Imagine you are traveling from Chennai to Coimbatore on 26/01/2024 and need a quick top-up. These chargers are your best bet. Remember these often come at a higher cost.", "normalised": "*   **D C Fast Charging:** This is the fastest option, often found at public charging stations along highways. These chargers can add significant range (eighty percent in under an hour, depending on the car) at a rate of one hundred plus kilometer of range per hour. Imagine you are traveling from Chennai to Coimbatore on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four and need a quick top-up. These chargers are your best bet. Remember these often come at a higher cost."}
{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right charging method depends on your needs and driving habits. Most EVs can be charged at home overnight. Public charging is ideal for long journeys or when you need a quick boost. Also consider the battery size. A Tata Nexon EV will have a smaller charging time compared to, say, a MG ZS EV.", "normalised": "Choosing the right charging method depends on your needs and driving habits.
