{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 Charging (Slow Charging):** This uses a standard 15A household socket, the kind you'd use for your fridge or washing machine. It's convenient but slow, adding only about 5-7 km of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging at home, like at your apartment in Delhi. Think of it like a slow burn – steady but not fast.", "normalised": "*   **Level one Charging (Slow Charging):** This uses a standard fifteen A household socket, the kind you'd use for your fridge or washing machine. It's convenient but slow, adding only about five to seven kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging at home, like at your apartment in Delhi. Think of it like a slow burn – steady but not fast."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2 Charging (AC Charging):** This is faster, requiring a dedicated charging point installed at your home or found in public charging stations. It typically adds around 30-50 km of range per hour. Many shopping malls in Bangalore, like Mantri Square, are installing these. You'll need a higher amperage circuit (around 32A) and likely a charging box installation costing anywhere from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 30,000.", "normalised": "*   **Level two Charging (A C Charging):** This is faster, requiring a dedicated charging point installed at your home or found in public charging stations. It typically adds around thirty to fifty kilometer of range per hour. Many shopping malls in Bangalore, like Mantri Square, are installing these. You'll need a higher amperage circuit (around thirty two A) and likely a charging box installation costing anywhere from rupee fifteen thousand to rupee thirty thousand."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 3 Charging (DC Fast Charging):** The fastest option, using direct current (DC) instead of alternating current (AC). These are mostly found at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. You can often get an 80% charge in under an hour, adding maybe 200-300 km of range depending on your vehicle and charger. Dr. Sharma at IIT Madras is doing some interesting research on optimizing DC fast charging infrastructure.", "normalised": "*   **Level three Charging (D C Fast Charging):** The fastest option, using direct current (D C) instead of alternating current (A C). These are mostly found at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. You can often get an eighty percent charge in under an hour, adding maybe two hundred to three hundred kilometer of range depending on your vehicle and charger. Doctor Sharma at I I T Madras is doing some interesting research on optimizing D C fast charging infrastructure."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence charging time: battery size, charging level, and ambient temperature. Just like your smartphone, charging may be slower in extreme heat or cold. Also, the cost per unit of electricity can vary depending on your state and electricity provider, making home charging often cheaper than public charging. Don't forget to factor in the space your home charger will take – typically, around 20 sq ft. So, before you drive from Chennai to Kolkata, plan your charging stops! Happy (and electric) driving!", "normalised": "Several factors influence charging time: battery size, charging level, and ambient temperature.
