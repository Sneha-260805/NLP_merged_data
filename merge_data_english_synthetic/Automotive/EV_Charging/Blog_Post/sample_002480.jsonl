{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 (Slow Charging):** This uses a standard 230V household outlet, similar to what you use for your TV or refrigerator. It's the slowest option, typically adding around 4-5 km of range per hour. Think of it as overnight trickle charging, perfect for smaller EVs or if you only need a few km added daily.", "normalised": "Level one (Slow Charging): This uses a standard two hundred and thirty volt household outlet, similar to what you use for your T V or refrigerator. It's the slowest option, typically adding around four to five kilometer of range per hour. Think of it as overnight trickle charging, perfect for smaller E V s or if you only need a few kilometer added daily."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 2 (Fast Charging):** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or found at public charging stations. It uses a 220V or 415V power supply, adding around 25-35 km of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging if you drive longer distances, say from Delhi to Gurgaon regularly. Many apartment complexes in cities like Bangalore are now installing Level 2 chargers.", "normalised": "Level two (Fast Charging): This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or found at public charging stations. It uses a two hundred and twenty volt or four hundred and fifteen volt power supply, adding around twenty five to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging if you drive longer distances, say from Delhi to Gurgaon regularly. Many apartment complexes in cities like Bangalore are now installing Level two chargers."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 3 (DC Fast Charging):** Also known as DCFC or simply \"fast charging,\" this uses high-voltage direct current (DC) to charge EVs significantly faster. Think adding 80% charge in about 30-60 minutes! You'll find these at dedicated charging hubs along highways and in urban centers. DCFC is crucial for long road trips, like driving from Jaipur to Agra.", "normalised": "Level three (D C Fast Charging): Also known as D C F C or simply \"fast charging,\" this uses high-voltage direct current (D C) to charge E V s significantly faster. Think adding eighty percent charge in about thirty to sixty minutes! You'll find these at dedicated charging hubs along highways and in urban centers. D C F C is crucial for long road trips, like driving from Jaipur to Agra."}
{"unnormalised": "Where can you charge your EV in India? Public charging stations are popping up across the country, often located near petrol pumps, shopping malls, and restaurants. Companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are actively building charging networks. You can also install a Level 2 charger at your home, which might require permissions from your Residents Welfare Association (RWA) and a visit from an electrician. The cost of a home charger can range from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000 depending on the features and power output.", "normalised": "Where can you charge your E V in India?

{"unnormalised": "Planning your routes and knowing where charging stations are located is key to a smooth EV ownership experience. Several apps and websites provide information on the location and availability of charging points. The government is also offering subsidies and incentives to encourage the adoption of EVs and the expansion of charging infrastructure, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Many new residential properties are now offering EV charging points as a standard amenity, allocating parking spots of around 150 sq ft for each EV with charging facility.", "normalised": "Planning your routes and knowing where charging stations are located is key to a smooth E V ownership experience.
