{"unnormalised": "Let's break it down. First off, you've got your home charging. Think of it as overnight biryani – slow and steady. You plug in after a long day of battling Bangalore traffic, and by morning, you're fully charged. This is typically done with a standard AC charger, giving you about 8-10 km of range per hour of charging. Good enough for most daily commutes, right?", "normalised": "Let us break it down. First off, you have got your home charging. Think of it as overnight biryani – slow and steady. You plug in after a long day of battling Bangalore traffic, and by morning, you are fully charged.

You'll find different types of chargers here: AC chargers, which are similar to your home charger but often faster, and DC fast chargers, which can give you a significant boost in a much shorter time – think almost 80% charge in around 45 minutes, depending on your car and the charger's capacity. Perfect if you're on a road trip to Goa and need a quick top-up.", "normalised": "Then there are public charging stations.
