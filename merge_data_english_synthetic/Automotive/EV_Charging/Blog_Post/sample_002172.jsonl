{"unnormalised": "Firstly, you need to understand the different levels of charging. Level 1 charging is the slowest, using a standard 230V AC household outlet, like the one you use for your TV. This is great for overnight charging at your home in, say, Bandra, and can add about 4-5 km of range per hour. Ideal for a small top-up before your morning commute at 07:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Firstly, you need to understand the different levels of charging. Level one charging is the slowest, using a standard two hundred and thirty volt A C household outlet, like the one you use for your T V. This is great for overnight charging at your home in, say, Bandra, and can add about four to five kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for a small top-up before your morning commute at seven o'clock."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging utilizes a dedicated 230V or 415V AC charger, offering a significantly faster charging rate – typically adding 20-30 km of range per hour. Many apartment complexes, workplaces (like those in Gurgaon), and public charging stations are equipped with Level 2 chargers. Think of it as charging your phone with a fast charger. You might find these at charging points operated by companies like Tata Power or Ather Energy.", "normalised": "Level two charging utilizes a dedicated two hundred and thirty volt or four hundred and fifteen volt A C charger, offering a significantly faster charging rate – typically adding twenty to thirty kilometer of range per hour.

You might find these at charging points operated by companies like Tata Power or Ather Energy."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, we have Level 3, or DC Fast Charging. This is the fastest option available, using direct current (DC) to directly charge the EV battery. It can add a significant amount of range (think 80% charge) in as little as 30-60 minutes, perfect for highway journeys or when you're in a hurry. These are usually found at dedicated charging hubs along highways connecting cities like Delhi and Jaipur. Remember that fast charging often comes with a cost, around Rs. 15-20 per unit.", "normalised": "Finally, we have Level three, or D C Fast Charging.

{"unnormalised": "Before buying an EV, consider your typical driving needs and charging options. Can you reliably charge at home or at work? Are there enough public charging stations in your area? Think about these things, and EV ownership can be a breeze, even if you have to wait a bit for the charger to be free on 26/01/2024! Just remember to check the availability, maybe around 17:00 hrs, before heading out.", "normalised": "Before buying an E V, consider your typical driving needs and charging options.
