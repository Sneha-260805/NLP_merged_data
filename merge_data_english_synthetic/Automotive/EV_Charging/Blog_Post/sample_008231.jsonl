{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 1 (Slow Charging):** This utilizes a standard 230V AC wall socket, similar to what you use for your TV or refrigerator. It's the slowest option, adding around 4-5 km of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging at home, like at Dr. Sharma's residence in Chennai.", "normalised": "*   **Level one (Slow Charging):** This utilizes a standard two hundred and thirty volt A C wall socket, similar to what you use for your T V or refrigerator.

{"unnormalised": "*   **Level 3 (DC Fast Charging):** The quickest method! These chargers (also known as DCFC or CCS2 in India) can add significant range (think 80% charge) in just 30-60 minutes.
