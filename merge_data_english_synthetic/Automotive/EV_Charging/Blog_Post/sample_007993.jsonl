{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the charging levels. Level 1 charging, using a standard 15A socket in your home (like the one you use for your washing machine), is the slowest. Expect around 5-8 km of range added per hour. Ideal for overnight charging, say starting at 22:00 hrs, topping up after your daily commute.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the charging levels. Level one charging, using a standard fifteen ampere socket in your home (like the one you use for your washing machine), is the slowest. Expect around five to eight kilometer of range added per hour. Ideal for overnight charging, say starting at twenty two hundred hours, topping up after your daily commute."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging, often found in malls like Select Citywalk in Delhi or residential complexes, requires a dedicated charging station and adds roughly 20-30 km per hour. Think of it as the equivalent of filling your petrol car halfway while you catch a movie. Many companies are installing these, offering them as amenities.", "normalised": "Level two charging, often found in malls like Select Citywalk in Delhi or residential complexes, requires a dedicated charging station and adds roughly twenty to thirty kilometer per hour.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's DC fast charging, the \"petrol pump\" of the EV world. These stations, increasingly popping up along highways like NH44, can add a significant amount of range – potentially 80% in 30-60 minutes. Imagine plugging in during your road trip from Bangalore to Chennai. This could be a lifesaver, especially around 15/08/2024, the long Independence Day weekend!", "normalised": "Then there is D C fast charging, the \"petrol pump\" of the E V world.

{"unnormalised": "The cost? It varies wildly! Home charging is the cheapest. Public charging can range from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25 per unit (kWh), depending on the provider and location.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to factor in your driving patterns. Do you primarily drive within the city or take frequent long journeys? This will help you choose the right EV and charging strategy. Think of the IIM graduate planning their weekend trip – thorough planning is key! With a little knowledge, EV charging in India becomes far less daunting.", "normalised": "Finally, remember to factor in your driving patterns.
