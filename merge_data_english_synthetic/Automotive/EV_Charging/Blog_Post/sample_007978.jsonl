{"unnormalised": "* **Level 1 Charging:** This is the slowest, using a standard 120V/15A household outlet. Think of it as trickle-charging your phone. It's convenient, but adding significant range (like 50 km) could take a long time, perhaps overnight (around 12-16 hours). You might find this useful for topping up at home after a short commute around Bangalore. Imagine plugging in at 09:00 hrs after dropping off the kids.", "normalised": "* **Level one Charging:** This is the slowest, using a standard one hundred and twenty volt divided by fifteen ampere household outlet. Think of it as trickle-charging your phone. It's convenient, but adding significant range (like fifty kilometer) could take a long time, perhaps overnight (around twelve to sixteen hours). You might find this useful for topping up at home after a short commute around Bangalore. Imagine plugging in at zero nine hundred hours after dropping off the kids."}
{"unnormalised": "* **Level 2 Charging:** This is much faster, utilizing a 240V outlet, similar to what you use for your AC or washing machine. A dedicated Level 2 charger can add around 25-35 km of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Delhi are starting to install these, and you can also get one installed at your home. This is the sweet spot for most EV owners. You could fully charge overnight in about 6-8 hours.", "normalised": "* **Level two Charging:** This is much faster, utilizing a two hundred and forty volt outlet, similar to what you use for your A C or washing machine. A dedicated Level two charger can add around twenty five to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Delhi are starting to install these, and you can also get one installed at your home. This is the sweet spot for most E V owners. You could fully charge overnight in about six to eight hours."}
{"unnormalised": "* **DC Fast Charging (DCFC):** This is the speed demon of EV charging, using high-voltage direct current. DCFC stations can add significant range – often 80% charge – in as little as 30-60 minutes. These are typically found at public charging stations along highways, perfect for long trips from Mumbai to Pune. Keep an eye out for charging stations popping up near petrol pumps, as Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil are investing heavily in EV infrastructure. Expect to pay a premium for this speed, perhaps around Rs. 15-20 per unit (kWh).", "normalised": "* **D C Fast Charging (D C F C):** This is the speed demon of E V charging, using high-voltage direct current. D C F C stations can add significant range – often eighty percent charge – in as little as thirty to sixty minutes. These are typically found at public charging stations along highways, perfect for long trips from Mumbai to Pune. Keep an eye out for charging stations popping up near petrol pumps, as Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil are investing heavily in E V infrastructure. Expect to pay a premium for this speed, perhaps around rupee fifteen to twenty per unit (kilo watt hour)."}
{"unnormalised": "Remember to check the compatibility of the charging connector with your EV. CHAdeMO and CCS are common standards. Also, consider factors like ambient temperature – extreme heat, like what we experience in Rajasthan during peak summer months, can affect charging speeds and battery performance.", "normalised": "Remember to check the compatibility of the charging connector with your E V.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government is actively promoting EV adoption. Schemes like FAME II provide subsidies, and many states offer additional incentives. The future of mobility is electric, and understanding charging is your key to unlocking it. Just like celebrating Republic Day on 26/01/1950, embracing EV charging marks a new chapter in India's automotive landscape. It’s not just about saving money on fuel; it’s about contributing to a cleaner and greener India for generations to come, like those graduating from IIT Kharagpur in 2023.", "normalised": "The Indian government is actively promoting E V adoption.
