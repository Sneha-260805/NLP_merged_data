One of the first things that probably pops into your head is: \"Where am I gonna charge this thing, yaar?\" Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds.

{"unnormalised": "First things first, home charging is your best friend. Imagine waking up every morning with a 'full tank' (or battery, in this case). You can get a standard AC charger installed at your place. It’s like putting a slow cooker on overnight – takes time, but gets the job done. Expect around 8-10 hours for a full charge, depending on your car and the charger’s power. Think of it as leaving your pressure cooker on for a leisurely Sunday lamb preparation.", "normalised": "First things first, home charging is your best friend.

Tata Power, Ather Energy, and a bunch of other companies are setting them up at malls, petrol pumps (ironic, right?), and even some roadside dhabas. You'll find both AC and DC fast chargers. DC chargers can juice you up much faster – think grabbing a quick vada pav versus sitting down for a full Onam sadhya. We're talking maybe 30-60 minutes to get a significant charge.", "normalised": "Then there are public charging stations. They’re popping up everywhere, like those fancy new chai stalls.

{"unnormalised": "The cost? Well, it varies. Home charging will usually be cheaper since you're paying your regular electricity bill. Public charging stations can charge you per unit (kWh) or per minute. Expect to shell out anywhere from Rs. 15-Rs. 25 per unit.", "normalised": "The cost? Well, it varies.

{"unnormalised": "Range anxiety is real, but getting better every day. Modern EVs can easily do 300-400 km on a single charge. Plus, apps like PlugShare and ElectriVa can help you find nearby charging stations and plan your route. So next time you plan a road trip to Goa, you don't have to stress about running out of juice halfway through. Just a bit of planning, like remembering to carry the right spices for your road trip snacks.", "normalised": "Range anxiety is real, but getting better every day.
