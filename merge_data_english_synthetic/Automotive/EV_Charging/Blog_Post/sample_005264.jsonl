{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, you're thinking of ditching that petrol guzzler for a shiny new electric vehicle? Smart move! But let's be real, the biggest worry for most Indians before taking the EV plunge is still charging. \"Kahaan charge karenge?\" is probably the most common question I get asked. No worries, I'm here to break it down for you.", "normalised": "Hey everyone! So, you're thinking of ditching that petrol guzzler for a shiny new electric vehicle? Smart move!

Invest in a good quality wall charger (around Rs. 15,000 – Rs. 25,000 depending on the brand and features).

{"unnormalised": "The cost? It varies, but generally, it's cheaper than filling up with petrol or diesel.
