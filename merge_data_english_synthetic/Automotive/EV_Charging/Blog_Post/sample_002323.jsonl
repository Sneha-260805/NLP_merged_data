{"unnormalised": "Essentially, you have different levels of charging, each affecting the time it takes to power up your EV. Level 1 is your basic, run-of-the-mill 120V household outlet. Think plugging in your phone, but a lot slower. It adds only about 4-5 km of range per hour. Fine for overnight charging if you’re not driving much, maybe enough for daily trips around your local Gurgaon sector.", "normalised": "Essentially, you have different levels of charging, each affecting the time it takes to power up your E V. Level one is your basic, run-of-the-mill one hundred and twenty volt household outlet. Think plugging in your phone, but a lot slower. It adds only about four to five kilometer of range per hour. Fine for overnight charging if you’re not driving much, maybe enough for daily trips around your local Gurgaon sector."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 uses a 240V outlet (like your AC or washing machine needs), offering a much faster charging rate – adding around 20-40 km of range per hour. Many homes and workplaces are installing Level 2 chargers now. Imagine charging your Tata Nexon EV at work between 09:00 hrs and 17:00 hrs – a decent chunk of battery replenished!", "normalised": "Level two uses a two hundred and forty volt outlet (like your A C or washing machine needs), offering a much faster charging rate – adding around twenty to forty kilometer of range per hour. Many homes and workplaces are installing Level two chargers now. Imagine charging your Tata Nexon E V at work between zero nine hundred hours and seventeen hundred hours – a decent chunk of battery replenished!"}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's DC Fast Charging (also known as Level 3). These are the powerhouses you find at dedicated charging stations, adding significant range – often 80% charge in under an hour. Think of refuelling at a petrol pump, but with electricity. These are crucial for long drives, say from Delhi to Jaipur, especially if you plan a quick stop around 14/03/2024 for a recharge.", "normalised": "Then there's D C Fast Charging (also known as Level three).

{"unnormalised": "India is also seeing the rise of public charging infrastructure, with companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy setting up stations across the country. Keep an eye out for apps that map these stations, a lifesaver on those unexpected road trips. Remember to factor in charging time and potential queues, especially during peak hours, like after the Independence Day long weekend rush on 15/08/2024.", "normalised": "India is also seeing the rise of public charging infrastructure, with companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy setting up stations across the country.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of charging varies depending on your electricity provider and whether you're using a public or private charger. Public charging can range from Rs. 15-25 per kWh, while home charging depends on your tariff. Ultimately, understanding your charging options is key to a smooth EV ownership experience in India. Consider even looking into solar panel integration at home to reduce your charging costs further!", "normalised": "The cost of charging varies depending on your electricity provider and whether you're using a public or private charger.
