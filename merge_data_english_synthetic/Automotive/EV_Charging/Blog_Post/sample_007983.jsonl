{"unnormalised": "* **DC Fast Charging:** The quickest option, these stations use Direct Current and can add significant range in a short amount of time. You might get an 80% charge in just 30-60 minutes. Perfect for a quick top-up during a long drive from Chennai to Bangalore.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the government's push for EV adoption, as evidenced by initiatives like the FAME scheme launched back on 15/08/2015, will undoubtedly improve charging infrastructure availability. By 2030, hopefully, range anxiety will be a thing of the past! Remember to always plan your routes and check for available charging stations using apps like PlugShare or the individual operator's app before embarking on a long journey. Safe driving, and happy charging!", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the government's push for E V adoption, as evidenced by initiatives like the FAME scheme launched back on fifteenth august two thousand and fifteen, will undoubtedly improve charging infrastructure availability.
