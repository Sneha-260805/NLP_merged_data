{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the different levels of charging. Level 1 charging, typically using a standard 15A household socket, is the slowest. Think of it as trickle-charging – adding just a few km of range per hour. Useful for overnight top-ups if you drive relatively short distances daily, like commuting to work near your home in Delhi.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the different levels of charging.

{"unnormalised": "Then we have DC Fast Charging, the quickest option. These high-power chargers can significantly boost your range in a relatively short time – often adding 100 km of range in under an hour, depending on the car and charger capabilities.

{"unnormalised": "Cost varies depending on the charging provider and the charging level. Level 1 charging using your home electricity might cost Rs. 8-10 per unit, while DC fast charging can be Rs. 18-25 per unit. Many providers offer subscription plans for discounted rates. Remember that having a dedicated parking spot of around 100 sq ft is crucial for installing a home charger. Hopefully, understanding these basics will make your transition to electric driving smoother!", "normalised": "Cost varies depending on the charging provider and the charging level.
