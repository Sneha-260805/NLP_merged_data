{"unnormalised": "*   **Slow Charging (Level 1):** This uses a standard 230V AC wall outlet, like you'd find in your home. Think of charging your mobile phone – slow and steady. This is great for overnight charging at home in your apartment in Delhi. Expect around 8-10 km of range added per hour of charging.", "normalised": "*   **Slow Charging (Level one):** This uses a standard two hundred and thirty volt A C wall outlet, like you'd find in your home.

Expect around eight to ten kilometer of range added per hour of charging."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **AC Charging (Level 2):** This is faster than Level 1 and requires a dedicated charging station, often found in malls, offices, or public charging locations. These stations typically operate at 3.3 kW or 7.2 kW. You'll likely find these popping up near popular chai stalls on the Mumbai-Pune expressway. Charging time is significantly reduced compared to Level 1.", "normalised": "*   **A C Charging (Level two):** This is faster than Level one and requires a dedicated charging station, often found in malls, offices, or public charging locations.

{"unnormalised": "*   **DC Fast Charging (Level 3):** This is the quickest option, perfect for topping up your battery on long journeys or when you're in a hurry. DC fast chargers are commonly found at highway rest stops and designated charging hubs. They can add a substantial amount of range (e.g., 80% charge) in as little as 30-60 minutes, depending on the charger's power output and your EV's charging capacity. Remember the 09:00 hrs deadline for reaching Agra? This will help you.", "normalised": "*   **D C Fast Charging (Level three):** This is the quickest option, perfect for topping up your battery on long journeys or when you're in a hurry.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to factor in charging costs. While generally cheaper than petrol or diesel, electricity rates vary across states. Check local electricity tariffs to estimate your charging expenses. Also, some charging stations might have different pricing models during peak hours (e.g., 17:00 hrs to 22:00 hrs).
