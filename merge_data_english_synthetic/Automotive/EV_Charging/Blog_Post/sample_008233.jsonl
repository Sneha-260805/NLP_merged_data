{"unnormalised": "1. **Slow Charging (Level 1):** This is like charging your phone overnight. Using a standard household socket (230V, 15A), it's the slowest option. Expect to add around 5-7 km of range per hour. Good for overnight charging at your home in Chennai.", "normalised": "one. **Slow Charging (Level one):** This is like charging your phone overnight. Using a standard household socket (two hundred and thirty volt, fifteen A), it's the slowest option. Expect to add around five to seven kilometer of range per hour.

{"unnormalised": "2. **AC Fast Charging (Level 2):** Faster than Level 1, this uses a dedicated charging unit (like a wallbox) that operates at a higher voltage (e.g., 7.4kW). You'll find these at malls, offices, and some public charging stations. It can add around 30-40 km of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Gurgaon are now installing these.", "normalised": "two. **A C Fast Charging (Level two):** Faster than Level one, this uses a dedicated charging unit (like a wallbox) that operates at a higher voltage (e.g., seven point four kilo watt).

{"unnormalised": "3. **DC Fast Charging (Level 3):** The fastest option, often referred to as \"rapid charging.\" Found primarily at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. It uses a high-power DC charger to deliver significant range in a short time (e.g., 50kW or higher). You can add a significant charge to travel between cities like Hyderabad and Vijayawada.", "normalised": "three. **D C Fast Charging (Level three):** The fastest option, often referred to as \"rapid charging.\" Found primarily at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of charging varies. Home charging is generally the cheapest, depending on your electricity rates (Rs. 5-Rs. 10 per unit). Public charging stations often charge per unit of electricity or per minute. Government subsidies are sometimes available for installing home chargers or using public charging infrastructure.", "normalised": "The cost of charging varies.

The future of EV charging in India is bright, but understanding the basics is the first step. Planning a trip? Factor in charging time and location, just like you would plan petrol stops. Investing in a home charging setup (requires approximately 100 sq ft of space) could be a great start for many EV owners.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at I I T Delhi is researching innovative charging solutions, including solar-powered charging stations.
