{"unnormalised": "*   **Slow Charging (AC Level 1):** This is the most basic type, using a standard 15A, 230V household socket. It's the slowest, adding about 5-8 km of range per hour of charging. Think of it as charging your phone overnight. Perfect for overnight charging at home, starting say, at 22:00 hrs.", "normalised": "*   **Slow Charging (A C Level one):** This is the most basic type, using a standard fifteen A, two hundred and thirty V household socket.

Perfect for overnight charging at home, starting say, at twenty two hundred hours."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Fast Charging (AC Level 2):** Requires a dedicated AC charging point, typically installed at homes, apartments, or offices.

{"unnormalised": "*   **DC Fast Charging (DC Level 3):** This is the fastest option, found at public charging stations.
