{"unnormalised": "First, understand there are generally three levels of EV charging. Level 1 is the slowest, using a standard 15 amp household socket. Think of it as plugging your phone in – convenient, but it'll take a while. Charging from near empty to full could take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. You could use this at your home in Chembur overnight.", "normalised": "First, understand there are generally three levels of E V charging. Level one is the slowest, using a standard fifteen amp household socket. Think of it as plugging your phone in – convenient, but it'll take a while. Charging from near empty to full could take anywhere from twelve to twenty four hours. You could use this at your home in Chembur overnight."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging uses a dedicated 220V outlet, significantly faster than Level 1. A full charge can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. Many housing societies in Gurgaon are now installing Level 2 chargers. These are commonly seen at malls, workplaces, and residential complexes. Some companies, like Tata Power, are aggressively expanding their Level 2 charging network.", "normalised": "Level two charging uses a dedicated two hundred and twenty V outlet, significantly faster than Level one.

{"unnormalised": "Level 3, also known as DC Fast Charging, is the fastest option. This uses direct current and can add a substantial amount of range – say, 80% charge – in as little as 30-60 minutes. You'll typically find these at highway rest stops or dedicated charging stations. Think of those long drives from Delhi to Jaipur; these fast chargers are your lifeline. Keep in mind that the availability of these chargers may vary depending on your location. Check apps like PlugShare to find locations near you, especially if planning a long trip on 26/01/2024.", "normalised": "Level three, also known as D C Fast Charging, is the fastest option.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence charging time, including the car's battery capacity, the charger's power output, and even the ambient temperature. A hot day in Chennai can impact charging efficiency. Also, remember that charging speed typically slows down as the battery approaches full capacity, a bit like filling a bucket with water.", "normalised": "Several factors influence charging time, including the car's battery capacity, the charger's power output, and even the ambient temperature.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, payment is usually facilitated through mobile apps or RFID cards. Prices vary by provider but typically range from Rs. 15-25 per unit. Some stations may offer discounted rates during off-peak hours (e.g., between 22:00 hrs and 06:00 hrs). Many providers offer subscription plans too. Do your research and choose what suits you best. With government initiatives like FAME India promoting EV adoption and charging infrastructure, expect to see even more charging options and lower costs in the near future. This will definitely help towards making India a fully EV adopted country by, say, 15/08/2030.", "normalised": "Finally, payment is usually facilitated through mobile apps or R F I D cards.
