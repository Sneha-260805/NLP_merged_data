{"unnormalised": "**1. Slow Charging (Home/Work):** This usually involves a standard wall socket (15A) and is ideal for overnight charging. Think of it like filling up your water tank drip by drip. It's the slowest, adding around 5-8 km of range per hour. Great for folks like Ramesh in Bangalore who leave their car plugged in overnight at home.", "normalised": "**one. Slow Charging (Home slash Work):** This usually involves a standard wall socket (fifteen A) and is ideal for overnight charging. Think of it like filling up your water tank drip by drip. It's the slowest, adding around five to eight kilometer of range per hour. Great for folks like Ramesh in Bangalore who leave their car plugged in overnight at home."}
{"unnormalised": "**2. AC Charging (Home/Public):** This requires a dedicated charging box, typically installed at home or available at public charging stations. It's faster, adding around 20-40 km of range per hour. Many housing societies in Delhi, seeing the EV trend, are installing these AC chargers.", "normalised": "**two. A C Charging (Home slash Public):** This requires a dedicated charging box, typically installed at home or available at public charging stations. It's faster, adding around twenty to forty kilometer of range per hour. Many housing societies in Delhi, seeing the E V trend, are installing these A C chargers."}
{"unnormalised": "**3. DC Fast Charging (Public):** This is the quickest option, adding significantly more range in a short time. Think filling stations on the highway, perfect for long journeys. You can add hundreds of km of range in under an hour, depending on the charger's power output (measured in kW) and the car's charging capacity. These are commonly found along highways connecting cities like Chennai and Hyderabad.", "normalised": "**three.

Remember to check your car’s charging specifications and plan your journeys accordingly. Also, consider the footprint of the charging station, which can range from a few sq ft for a wall-mounted charger to much larger for public stations. Happy driving, and may your batteries always be full!", "normalised": "Investing in an E V is a big step, but understanding the charging ecosystem makes the transition smoother.
