{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the levels of charging. Level 1 charging, often using a standard 15A plug point in your home (like the one you use for your fridge), is the slowest. Think of it as trickle charging – it might give you around 4-5 km of range per hour. Good for overnight charging, especially if you're only covering short distances, say from your home in Vile Parle to your office in Bandra.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the levels of charging.

{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging utilizes a dedicated EV charger, typically installed in homes or public charging stations. These chargers use 230V AC power and can provide significantly faster charging rates, perhaps 20-30 km of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Gurgaon are now installing these, making EV ownership more convenient.", "normalised": "Level two charging utilizes a dedicated E V charger, typically installed in homes or public charging stations. These chargers use two hundred and thirty V A C power and can provide significantly faster charging rates, perhaps twenty to thirty kilometer of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Gurgaon are now installing these, making E V ownership more convenient."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's DC fast charging, also known as Level 3 charging. These are the powerhouses you'll find at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. They use direct current (DC) and can deliver a significant amount of charge in a relatively short time – think adding 100 km of range in perhaps 30 minutes. This is ideal for long drives, like a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur.", "normalised": "Then there's D C fast charging, also known as Level three charging. These are the powerhouses you'll find at highway rest stops and dedicated charging hubs. They use direct current (D C) and can deliver a significant amount of charge in a relatively short time – think adding one hundred kilometer of range in perhaps thirty minutes. This is ideal for long drives, like a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur."}
{"unnormalised": "Bharat DC001 is a standard prevalent in India. Companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are actively expanding the charging infrastructure. Public charging prices vary, often charged per unit (kWh) consumed. Keep an eye out for apps that aggregate charging station locations and pricing. Remember, maintenance is crucial for these stations, so reliability can fluctuate.", "normalised": "Bharat D C zero zero one is a standard prevalent in India.

{"unnormalised": "Charging times depend on battery size and charger output. A smaller battery, say 30 kWh, will charge much faster than a larger 60 kWh pack. Always consult your vehicle’s manual for specific charging information.", "normalised": "Charging times depend on battery size and charger output.

{"unnormalised": "Thinking of installing a charger at home? Consult with a certified electrician to ensure your electrical system can handle the load. Dr. Sharma, an expert from IIT Delhi, recommends ensuring adequate grounding and surge protection. Expect to spend around Rs. 20,000-Rs. 60,000 for a home charger and its installation, depending on the charger's features and the complexity of the electrical work. Consider factors like the available space (e.g., a minimum of 100 sq ft) and the proximity to your parking spot.", "normalised": "Thinking of installing a charger at home?
