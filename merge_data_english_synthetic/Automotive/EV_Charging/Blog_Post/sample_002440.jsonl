{"unnormalised": "Firstly, there are different levels of charging. Level 1 is your basic AC charging, using a standard 15A socket you might find in your home. This is the slowest, adding around 5-8 km of range per hour – perfect for overnight charging for folks like Mrs. Sharma in her apartment in Bangalore.", "normalised": "Firstly, there are different levels of charging. Level one is your basic A C charging, using a standard fifteen A socket you might find in your home. This is the slowest, adding around five to eight kilometer of range per hour – perfect for overnight charging for folks like Missus Sharma in her apartment in Bangalore."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 AC charging, often found at public charging stations or installed in apartment complexes like the ones near IIT Madras, uses a 3.3kW or 7.4kW charger. This provides a significantly faster charge, adding roughly 20-40 km of range per hour. Think of it as the express train compared to the local.", "normalised": "Level two A C charging, often found at public charging stations or installed in apartment complexes like the ones near I I T Madras, uses a three point three kilo watt or seven point four kilo watt charger. This provides a significantly faster charge, adding roughly twenty to forty kilometer of range per hour. Think of it as the express train compared to the local."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's DC fast charging. These are the powerhouses, often found along highways like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. They can provide a substantial charge, upwards of 100 km in about 30 minutes. Ideal for long journeys and those \"range anxiety\" moments, though they might cost a bit more per unit of electricity, say around Rs. 18-22 per kWh.", "normalised": "Then there's D C fast charging. These are the powerhouses, often found along highways like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. They can provide a substantial charge, upwards of one hundred kilometer in about thirty minutes. Ideal for long journeys and those \"range anxiety\" moments, though they might cost a bit more per unit of electricity, say around rupee eighteen to twenty two per kilo watt hour."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors affect charging time. The battery capacity of your EV (measured in kWh), the charger's power output, and even ambient temperature play a role. Dr. Iyer from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) emphasizes the importance of maintaining your battery health for optimal charging efficiency.", "normalised": "Several factors affect charging time.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the levels, there are different charging standards too – CHAdeMO, CCS, and Type 2 AC. Make sure your EV's charging port is compatible with the available infrastructure. Newer EVs are increasingly adopting the CCS standard.", "normalised": "Beyond the levels, there are different charging standards too – C H A de M O, C C S, and Type two A C. Make sure your E V's charging port is compatible with the available infrastructure. Newer E V's are increasingly adopting the C C S standard."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, consider your charging needs. If you primarily drive within the city, home charging might suffice. For longer trips, planning your route around available charging stations is crucial. Apps like PlugShare and ChargePoint can help you locate charging stations near you, even in smaller towns like Madurai. With a bit of planning, EV charging can be as easy as enjoying a cup of chai at a roadside stall. And, think about installing a solar panel on your 1000 sq ft roof to offset charging costs!", "normalised": "Finally, consider your charging needs.
