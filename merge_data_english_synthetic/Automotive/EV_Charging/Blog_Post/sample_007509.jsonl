Companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are installing charging grids across India."}

Many new E-Vs have a real-world range of three hundred to four hundred kilometer on a single charge. That's enough to drive from Mumbai to Pune, no sweat! And with charging infrastructure improving every day, range anxiety is becoming a thing of the past. Even during Onam holidays, you can expect charging spots on your Kerala road trips! Just plan your route ahead using apps like PlugShare and you'll be fine. So, ready to go electric, my friend? Happy driving!"}
