Don't stress, it's not as complicated as figuring out a Pani Puri recipe!", "normalised": "Hey folks! So, you're thinking about ditching the petrol pump queues and going electric? Good on ya!

{"unnormalised": "First things first, understand that EV charging isn't just one-size-fits-all. You've got slow charging (think overnight at home, maybe taking 8-12 hours for a full charge), fast charging (at public stations, can top you up in a couple of hours), and then there's the really rapid stuff – DC fast charging – which can give you a decent boost in like, 30-45 minutes. Imagine grabbing a quick filter coffee while your car charges up!", "normalised": "First things first, understand that E V charging isn't just one-size-fits-all.

{"unnormalised": "Now, where can you actually *do* this charging, eh? Well, more and more public charging stations are popping up. Think of them like the new petrol bunks, but less smelly! You'll find them in malls, near restaurants, even some BPCL petrol pumps are getting into the game. Companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are setting up networks all over.", "normalised": "Now, where can you actually *do* this charging, eh?
