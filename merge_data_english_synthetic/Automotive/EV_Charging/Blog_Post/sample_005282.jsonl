Slow charging (think overnight at home with a regular plug) is like having your dadi slowly feed you delicious Onam payasam – satisfying, but takes a while. Fast charging (at public stations) is more like grabbing a quick vada pav – gets the job done much faster. Expect to add around 80 km of range per hour with a decent fast charger. Cost? Could be anything from Rs. 8 per unit to Rs. 20, depending on the provider and time of day.", "normalised": "Charging speeds? Well, that depends.
