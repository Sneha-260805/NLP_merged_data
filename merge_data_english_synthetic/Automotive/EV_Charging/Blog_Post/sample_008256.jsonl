{"unnormalised": "This is your basic, everyday charging, using a standard 15A/230V household socket. Think of plugging in your phone. It’s slow, adding only about 4-8 km of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging, especially if your daily commute is within, say, 50 km. Most EV manufacturers provide a charging cable for this purpose. This is often the cheapest option, costing you just the electricity bill – probably a few Rs. per unit.", "normalised": "This is your basic, everyday charging, using a standard fifteen ampere two hundred and thirty volt household socket.

{"unnormalised": "**Level 2: Accelerated Charging (Home/Public)**", "normalised": "**Level two: Accelerated Charging (Home or Public)**"}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 chargers use a 220V or 240V circuit (like your AC or geyser outlet) and require a dedicated charging unit. These chargers can add around 20-50 km of range per hour, making them significantly faster than Level 1. You’ll often find them installed in homes (requires some wiring), apartment complexes, and public charging stations. Many companies offer Level 2 chargers, and the installation can cost anywhere between Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 60,000 depending on the model and complexity of installation.", "normalised": "Level two chargers use a two hundred and twenty volt or two hundred and forty volt circuit (like your A C or geyser outlet) and require a dedicated charging unit. These chargers can add around twenty to fifty kilometer of range per hour, making them significantly faster than Level one. You’ll often find them installed in homes (requires some wiring), apartment complexes, and public charging stations. Many companies offer Level two chargers, and the installation can cost anywhere between rupees twenty thousand to rupees sixty thousand depending on the model and complexity of installation."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 3: DC Fast Charging (Public)**", "normalised": "**Level three: D C Fast Charging (Public)**"}
{"unnormalised": "This is where the magic happens! DC Fast Chargers (DCFC), often found at highway rest stops like those on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway or outside popular malls in Delhi, can charge your EV up to 80% in as little as 30-60 minutes. They use a powerful direct current (DC) source and can deliver a substantial amount of charge quickly. Dr. Sharma at IIT Madras is actively researching advancements in DC Fast Charging technology. These chargers are the most expensive to install and use, often charging per minute or per kWh. Finding a convenient charging spot can be tricky, so plan your long journeys, especially across states like Rajasthan, accordingly.", "normalised": "This is where the magic happens!

Investing in a dedicated home charger (Level 2) might be a worthwhile investment if you have access to parking space of at least 100 sq ft in your apartment complex. Remember, charging habits are key to extending the lifespan of your EV battery. Happy driving, Jai Hind!", "normalised": "Choosing the right charging setup depends on your needs and budget.
