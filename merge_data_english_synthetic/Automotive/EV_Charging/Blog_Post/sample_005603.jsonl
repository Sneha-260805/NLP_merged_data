{"unnormalised": "There are primarily three levels of EV charging. Level 1 charging utilizes a standard 120V AC outlet. It's the slowest option, typically adding only 4-5 km of range per hour. Think of it as trickle-charging your phone – useful for overnight top-ups if you drive short distances daily, say within city limits like Bangalore.", "normalised": "There are primarily three levels of E V charging. Level one charging utilizes a standard one hundred and twenty volt A C outlet. It's the slowest option, typically adding only four to five kilometer of range per hour. Think of it as trickle-charging your phone – useful for overnight top-ups if you drive short distances daily, say within city limits like Bangalore."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging uses a 240V AC outlet. This is significantly faster, capable of adding between 20-50 km of range per hour, depending on the charger and your EV's capabilities. Most homes can install a Level 2 charger; expect to invest Rs. 20,000 - Rs. 50,000 for the charger and installation. Many apartments in Gurgaon are now offering this as an amenity.", "normalised": "Level two charging uses a two hundred and forty volt A C outlet. This is significantly faster, capable of adding between twenty to fifty kilometer of range per hour, depending on the charger and your E V's capabilities. Most homes can install a Level two charger; expect to invest rupee twenty thousand – rupee fifty thousand for the charger and installation. Many apartments in Gurgaon are now offering this as an amenity."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 3, or DC Fast Charging, is the fastest option. Using direct current (DC), these chargers can add 80% of your battery capacity in about 30-60 minutes. These are typically found at public charging stations along highways, like those connecting Delhi to Jaipur. They are expensive to install and operate, hence the higher per-unit electricity cost.", "normalised": "Level three, or D C Fast Charging, is the fastest option.

{"unnormalised": "If you plan on owning an EV, consider installing a Level 2 charger at your home. Ensure your wiring can handle the increased load. Dr. Banerjee from IIT Kanpur is currently researching smart grid solutions for efficient EV charging in residential areas. If you live in a building with limited space, like a small apartment (say 500 sq ft), explore shared charging options with your neighbors.", "normalised": "If you plan on owning an E V, consider installing a Level two charger at your home.
