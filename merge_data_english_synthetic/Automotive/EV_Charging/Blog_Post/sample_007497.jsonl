Good for overnight charging in your apartment parking in Bangalore. Fast charging, at dedicated charging stations (like those popping up along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway), can juice you up significantly faster – maybe an hour or two to get a good range. Then there's super-fast charging, still not super common, but promising seriously quick top-ups.", "normalised": "We have a few different types of charging here in India.
