{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understanding the levels of charging is crucial. Level 1 charging, often using a standard 15 Amp household socket, is the slowest. Think of it as trickle-charging your phone overnight. This method can add only a few kilometers of range per hour, suitable for overnight top-ups. Mr. Sharma in Delhi might use this to add about 50 km overnight to his Tata Nexon EV.", "normalised": "Firstly, understanding the levels of charging is crucial.

These stations, often providing 3.3 kW or 7.2 kW, can fully charge an EV in a few hours. You'll find these at malls, offices, and even some residential complexes in areas like Koramangala, Bangalore. Dr. Iyer from IIT Madras is researching ways to optimize level 2 charging for faster speeds.", "normalised": "Level two charging, utilizing a dedicated charging station (either at home or public), is significantly faster.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, we have DC Fast Charging (DCFC). This is the king of speed, using direct current to deliver high power (50 kW and above) directly to the battery. This can add substantial range in a short period, perfect for long journeys or quick top-ups. Imagine driving from Jaipur to Agra and using a DCFC station on the highway to add 200 km of range in just 30 minutes.", "normalised": "Finally, we have D C Fast Charging (D C F C).

Imagine driving from Jaipur to Agra and using a D C F C station on the highway to add two hundred kilometer of range in just thirty minutes."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the levels, understanding charging costs is essential. While electricity tariffs vary across states, charging at home is generally cheaper than using public charging stations. Public charging costs can range from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25 per kWh. Some apartment complexes offer EV charging facilities with monthly rentals, say Rs. 2000 per month, covering a certain amount of usage.", "normalised": "Beyond the levels, understanding charging costs is essential.

Apps like PlugShare and ElectriPe can help you locate nearby charging stations. Also, consider home charging solutions. A dedicated EV charger can take up a space of approximately 20 sq ft in your garage.", "normalised": "Moreover, the location matters.
