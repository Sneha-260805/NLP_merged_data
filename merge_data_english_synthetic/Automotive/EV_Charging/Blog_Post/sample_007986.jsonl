{"unnormalised": "**Level 1: Slow and Steady wins the race (sometimes)** This is your standard home charging using a regular 15A socket. It's the slowest, adding only about 4-5 km of range per hour. Think of it as overnight charging – plug in your Tata Nexon EV when you park for the night, and it'll be ready for your commute by 09:00 hrs. Good for top-ups or situations where time isn't a constraint.", "normalised": "**Level one: Slow and Steady wins the race (sometimes)** This is your standard home charging using a regular fifteen A socket. It's the slowest, adding only about four to five kilometer of range per hour.

{"unnormalised": "**Level 2: The Mid-Range Option.** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It’s significantly faster than Level 1, adding around 25-35 km of range per hour. Ideal for topping up your Mahindra XUV400 during a work day. You might find these in apartment complexes in Bangalore or corporate parking lots.", "normalised": "**Level two: The Mid-Range Option.** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It’s significantly faster than Level one, adding around twenty five to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for topping up your Mahindra X U V four hundred during a work day. You might find these in apartment complexes in Bangalore or corporate parking lots."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 3: DC Fast Charging – The Need for Speed!** This is the fastest option, found at public charging stations along highways or in cities. It can add 100-200 km of range in just 30-60 minutes, depending on the car and charging station. Perfect for road trips, say from Delhi to Jaipur. However, frequent use can potentially impact battery health over the long term. Imagine quickly topping up your MG ZS EV before continuing your journey, arriving in Jaipur by 17:00 hrs after leaving Delhi at 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2024.", "normalised": "**Level three: D C Fast Charging – The Need for Speed!** This is the fastest option, found at public charging stations along highways or in cities. It can add one hundred to two hundred kilometer of range in just thirty to sixty minutes, depending on the car and charging station. Perfect for road trips, say from Delhi to Jaipur. However, frequent use can potentially impact battery health over the long term. Imagine quickly topping up your M G Z S E V before continuing your journey, arriving in Jaipur by seventeen hundred hours after leaving Delhi at ten hundred hours on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four."}
