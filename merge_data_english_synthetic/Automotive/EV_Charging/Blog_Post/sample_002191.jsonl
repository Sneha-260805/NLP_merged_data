{"unnormalised": "Think of your EV's battery like your phone's. You need to plug it in to replenish the charge. The \"plug\" in this case is the charging cable, and the \"socket\" is the charging port on your EV. The amount of time it takes to charge depends on several factors including battery size, the charger's power output (measured in kilowatts, kW), and the existing charge level.", "normalised": "Think of your E V's battery like your phone's.

{"unnormalised": "*   **Slow Charging (Level 1):** This uses a standard 230V AC wall outlet like the ones in your home. It's the slowest method, typically adding around 8-10 km of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging at home in places like your parking spot in Delhi. Expect a full charge in maybe 10-12 hours. Great if you’re mostly driving within the city, say, less than 50 km a day.", "normalised": "*   **Slow Charging (Level one):** This uses a standard two hundred and thirty volt A C wall outlet like the ones in your home. It's the slowest method, typically adding around eight to ten kilometer of range per hour. Ideal for overnight charging at home in places like your parking spot in Delhi. Expect a full charge in maybe ten to twelve hours. Great if you’re mostly driving within the city, say, less than fifty kilometer a day."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **Fast Charging (Level 2):** This utilizes a dedicated charging station that delivers higher power AC. You can find these at shopping malls, workplaces, and increasingly, at dedicated EV charging hubs along highways. They add approximately 30-60 km of range per hour. Expect a full charge in 4-6 hours, perfect for topping up during a visit to Select CITYWALK on 01/01/2024, say around 14:00 hrs.", "normalised": "*   **Fast Charging (Level two):** This utilizes a dedicated charging station that delivers higher power A C. You can find these at shopping malls, workplaces, and increasingly, at dedicated E V charging hubs along highways. They add approximately thirty to sixty kilometer of range per hour. Expect a full charge in four to six hours, perfect for topping up during a visit to Select CITYWALK on first january two thousand and twenty four, say around two P M."}
{"unnormalised": "*   **DC Fast Charging (Level 3):** Also known as supercharging, this is the fastest option. DC chargers deliver power directly to the battery, bypassing the car's onboard charger. They can add around 100-200 km of range in just 30 minutes. Perfect for long journeys like driving from Bangalore to Chennai. Keep in mind that not all EVs are compatible with DC fast charging.", "normalised": "*   **D C Fast Charging (Level three):** Also known as supercharging, this is the fastest option. D C chargers deliver power directly to the battery, bypassing the car's onboard charger. They can add around one hundred to two hundred kilometer of range in just thirty minutes. Perfect for long journeys like driving from Bangalore to Chennai. Keep in mind that not all E Vs are compatible with D C fast charging."}
{"unnormalised": "Many companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are setting up charging infrastructure across India. Apps are available to help you locate nearby charging stations, check their availability, and even pay for your charging session. Expect to pay anywhere from Rs. 15-25 per kWh for public charging. This might be slightly cheaper than petrol, depending on the petrol price on 15/08/2023, for example.", "normalised": "Many companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are setting up charging infrastructure across India.
