{"unnormalised": "Well, things are actually looking up! Remember those days when finding an EV charger was like hunting for a decent plate of biryani at 3 AM? (Almost impossible, unless you knew a guy, who knew a guy...). Now, companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are seriously ramping up their charging networks. You're starting to see charging stations popping up at malls, petrol pumps (ironic, right?), and even some apartment complexes in Bangalore and Delhi.", "normalised": "Well, things are actually looking up!

Public charging can range from Rs. 15-25 per unit, and installing a home charger can set you back anywhere from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000 depending on the type.", "normalised": "Okay, so it's not perfect.
