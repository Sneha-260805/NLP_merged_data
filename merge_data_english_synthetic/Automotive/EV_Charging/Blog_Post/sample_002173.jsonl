{"unnormalised": "* **Level 1 Charging (Slowest):** This utilizes a standard 15A household socket, like the one you use for your TV. It's incredibly convenient for overnight charging at home, but it's also the slowest. Expect to gain around 4-5 km of range per hour. Think of plugging in your scooter on Diwali night, 24/10/2024, and finding it fully charged by the next morning.", "normalised": "* **Level one Charging (Slowest):** This utilizes a standard fifteen A household socket, like the one you use for your T V. It's incredibly convenient for overnight charging at home, but it's also the slowest. Expect to gain around four to five kilometer of range per hour. Think of plugging in your scooter on Diwali night, twenty fourth october two thousand and twenty four, and finding it fully charged by the next morning."}
{"unnormalised": "* **Level 2 Charging (Faster):** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It uses a higher voltage and can provide significantly faster charging, adding around 20-30 km of range per hour. Many companies, like Tata Power, are setting up these charging stations across India. Think of this as your everyday solution, plugging in at 09:00 hrs before heading to your office in Connaught Place, Delhi.", "normalised": "* **Level two Charging (Faster):** This requires a dedicated charging unit installed at your home or workplace. It uses a higher voltage and can provide significantly faster charging, adding around twenty to thirty kilometer of range per hour. Many companies, like Tata Power, are setting up these charging stations across India. Think of this as your everyday solution, plugging in at zero nine hundred hours before heading to your office in Connaught Place, Delhi."}
{"unnormalised": "* **Level 3 Charging (DC Fast Charging):** This is the fastest charging method, often found at public charging stations along highways and in cities. It uses direct current (DC) and can provide a significant range boost in a short amount of time – often adding 80% charge in around 30-60 minutes. These are ideal for long journeys, say a road trip from Bangalore to Chennai. You could grab a quick chai and samosa while your car juices up. This is like those emergency top-ups before your grandaunt Lakshmi arrives at 18:00 hrs on 01/01/2025!", "normalised": "* **Level three Charging (D C Fast Charging):** This is the fastest charging method, often found at public charging stations along highways and in cities.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence charging time, including battery capacity, charging level, and the car's charging capabilities. The cost can vary depending on the electricity tariff, but generally, it's cheaper than fueling a petrol or diesel vehicle. Think of it as paying around Rs. 8-10 per unit of electricity.", "normalised": "Several factors influence charging time, including battery capacity, charging level, and the car's charging capabilities.
