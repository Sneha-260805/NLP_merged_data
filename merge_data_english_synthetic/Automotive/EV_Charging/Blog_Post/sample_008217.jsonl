{"unnormalised": "First, understand there are different levels of EV charging. Level 1 charging is the slowest, using a standard 120V household outlet. Think of it like charging your phone – it takes a while! This can add about 4-5 km of range per hour.", "normalised": "First, understand there are different levels of E V charging. Level one charging is the slowest, using a standard one hundred and twenty volt household outlet. Think of it like charging your phone – it takes a while! This can add about four to five kilometer of range per hour."}
{"unnormalised": "Level 2 charging uses a 240V outlet and is significantly faster. This is what you might install at home or find at public charging stations in places like Bengaluru's tech parks. It can add around 20-30 km of range per hour. Institutions like IIT Delhi are also investing heavily in Level 2 infrastructure.", "normalised": "Level two charging uses a two hundred and forty volt outlet and is significantly faster. This is what you might install at home or find at public charging stations in places like Bengaluru's tech parks. It can add around twenty to thirty kilometer of range per hour. Institutions like I I T Delhi are also investing heavily in Level two infrastructure."}
{"unnormalised": "Then we have DC Fast Charging, also known as Level 3 charging. This is the fastest option, and can provide a significant charge in a short amount of time – perfect for long highway journeys. This type of charging is typically found at dedicated charging stations, often near petrol pumps or in large parking areas covering thousands of sq ft. Expect to add around 100-200 km of range in about 30 minutes, depending on the car and charger.", "normalised": "Then we have D C Fast Charging, also known as Level three charging.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of charging varies. Home charging is generally the cheapest, as you pay your regular electricity rates. Public charging stations often charge per kWh (kilowatt-hour) or per minute of charging. The exact cost will depend on the charging provider and your location. Dr. Sharma, an EV researcher from IISC Bangalore, estimates that fast charging could cost around Rs. 8-10 per kWh.", "normalised": "The cost of charging varies.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, consider charging habits. Many EV owners find it convenient to charge overnight at home, much like keeping their smartphones charged. Don't let the range anxiety scare you! Planning your route, knowing the location of charging stations, and understanding the different charging levels can make owning an EV a breeze. Happy driving, Namaste!", "normalised": "Finally, consider charging habits. Many E V owners find it convenient to charge overnight at home, much like keeping their smartphones charged.
