{"unnormalised": "**Level 1 Charging:** This is the slowest method, utilizing a standard 15A household socket. It's like charging your phone - convenient but slow. Expect around 4-5 km of range per hour of charging. Imagine plugging your Tata Nexon EV in at home at 22:00 hrs after a long day and getting only a partial charge by 06:00 hrs the next morning.", "normalised": "**Level one Charging:** This is the slowest method, utilizing a standard fifteen ampere household socket. It's like charging your phone - convenient but slow. Expect around four to five kilometer of range per hour of charging. Imagine plugging your Tata Nexon E V in at home at twenty two hundred hours after a long day and getting only a partial charge by zero six hundred hours the next morning."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 2 Charging:** This is faster than Level 1, often available at public charging stations or through a dedicated home charger. It typically delivers 20-35 km of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Delhi are now installing Level 2 chargers for residents. This is a good option for daily commutes.", "normalised": "**Level two Charging:** This is faster than Level one, often available at public charging stations or through a dedicated home charger. It typically delivers twenty to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Many apartment complexes in Delhi are now installing Level two chargers for residents. This is a good option for daily commutes."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 3 (DC Fast Charging):** The fastest charging method, DC fast chargers are found at public charging stations along highways and in cities. These chargers can provide 80% charge in as little as 30-60 minutes, adding hundreds of kilometers of range quickly. Ideal for long trips, like driving from Jaipur to Agra.", "normalised": "**Level three (D C Fast Charging):** The fastest charging method, D C fast chargers are found at public charging stations along highways and in cities.

{"unnormalised": "Looking at the cost, the per-unit electricity charge depends on your supplier. Home charging is generally cheaper than public charging. Public charging costs can vary from Rs. 15/kWh to Rs. 25/kWh depending on the provider and time of day. For example, some companies offer off-peak discounts between 23:00 hrs and 07:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Looking at the cost, the per-unit electricity charge depends on your supplier.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, keep in mind that driving style, weather conditions, and battery health can affect your EV's range. It's crucial to plan your trips, especially long ones, keeping in mind the availability of charging stations. The Indian government is actively promoting the development of charging infrastructure, and companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are setting up charging networks across the country. Hopefully by 15/08/2025, finding a reliable charging station will be as easy as finding a petrol pump is today. Institutions like IIT Madras are also researching innovative charging technologies.", "normalised": "Finally, keep in mind that driving style, weather conditions, and battery health can affect your E V's range.
