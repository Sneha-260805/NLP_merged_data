It's the slowest option, adding around 4-5 km of range per hour. Great for overnight charging at your home in Delhi.", "normalised": "**Level one: Slow Charging (A C)** This utilizes a standard two hundred and thirty volt household outlet, like the one powering your washing machine. It's the slowest option, adding around four to five kilometer of range per hour. Great for overnight charging at your home in Delhi."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 2: Medium Speed Charging (AC)** Requires a dedicated charging station, typically installed at homes, offices, or public parking spaces. These stations use a higher voltage (often 7.4 kW or 11 kW) and can add around 30-40 km of range per hour. Think parking lots at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon.", "normalised": "**Level two: Medium Speed Charging (A C)** Requires a dedicated charging station, typically installed at homes, offices, or public parking spaces.

{"unnormalised": "**Level 3: Fast Charging (DC)** Also known as DC fast charging, this is the quickest way to charge your EV. These high-powered chargers (50 kW and above) can add 80% charge in as little as 30 minutes.

{"unnormalised": "Several companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are building robust charging infrastructure across India. You can find charging stations using apps like PlugShare or Tata Power EZ Charge. Cost of charging varies, but generally, it's significantly cheaper than fueling a petrol car.

{"unnormalised": "Before purchasing an EV, research the charging options available in your area and consider installing a Level 2 charger at your home. Dr. Sharma from IIT Madras suggests that investing in renewable energy sources like solar panels (covering, say, 500 sq ft of your rooftop) can further reduce charging costs and your carbon footprint.
