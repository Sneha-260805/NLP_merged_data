{"unnormalised": "First things first, home charging is your best friend. Imagine waking up every morning with a \"full tank\" (or battery, rather!). You can get a wall-mounted charger installed at your house, or even just use a regular 15A socket if your car supports it. Costs vary, but expect to shell out anywhere from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 50,000 for a dedicated charger.", "normalised": "first things first, home charging is your best friend. imagine waking up every morning with a \"full tank\" (or battery, rather!). you can get a wall-mounted charger installed at your house, or even just use a regular fifteen A socket if your car supports it. costs vary, but expect to shell out anywhere from rupee fifteen thousand to rupee fifty thousand for a dedicated charger."}

You can find charging stations popping up at petrol pumps, shopping malls, and even some restaurants. Companies like Tata Power, Ather Energy, and Charge+Zone are setting up networks across India. Think of it like finding a good biryani place during Eid - a bit of searching, but totally worth it!", "normalised": "now, what about when you're on the go? public charging infrastructure is still growing, but it's definitely improving. you can find charging stations popping up at petrol pumps, shopping malls, and even some restaurants. companies like Tata Power, Ather Energy, and Charge+Zone are setting up networks across India. think of it like finding a good biryani place during Eid - a bit of searching, but totally worth it!"}
{"unnormalised": "Charging speeds also vary. Slow charging (AC) can take several hours, while fast charging (DC) can get you to 80% in under an hour. Expect to pay anywhere from Rs. 10 to Rs. 25 per unit, depending on the charging provider and the speed. A good rule of thumb? Download a charging app like PlugShare or ElectriVerse. They'll show you nearby charging stations and their availability, kind of like Zomato, but for your car's stomach!", "normalised": "charging speeds also vary. slow charging (A C) can take several hours, while fast charging (D C) can get you to eighty percent in under an hour. expect to pay anywhere from rupee ten to rupee twenty five per unit, depending on the charging provider and the speed. a good rule of thumb? download a charging app like PlugShare or ElectriVerse. they'll show you nearby charging stations and their availability, kind of like Zomato, but for your car's stomach!"}
