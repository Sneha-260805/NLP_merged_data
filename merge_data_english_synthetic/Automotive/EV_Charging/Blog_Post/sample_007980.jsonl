There are generally three levels of charging:"}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 1 (Slow Charging):** This uses a standard 230V household outlet, like the one you use for your TV or refrigerator. It's the slowest method, adding approximately 4-5 km of range per hour. Perfect for overnight charging at home, say from 22:00 hrs to 06:00 hrs. Imagine plugging in your Tata Nexon EV after a long day in Delhi traffic and waking up to a fully charged car.", "normalised": "**Level one (Slow Charging):** This uses a standard two hundred and thirty volt household outlet, like the one you use for your T V or refrigerator. It's the slowest method, adding approximately four to five kilometer of range per hour. Perfect for overnight charging at home, say from twenty two hundred hours to zero six hundred hours. Imagine plugging in your Tata Nexon E V after a long day in Delhi traffic and waking up to a fully charged car."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 2 (Medium Charging):** Requires a dedicated charging station installed at your home or found at public charging locations, often malls or office complexes. This provides a faster charging rate, adding around 25-35 km of range per hour. Many apartments in Bengaluru are now mandated to install Level 2 chargers.", "normalised": "**Level two (Medium Charging):** Requires a dedicated charging station installed at your home or found at public charging locations, often malls or office complexes. This provides a faster charging rate, adding around twenty five to thirty five kilometer of range per hour. Many apartments in Bengaluru are now mandated to install Level two chargers."}
{"unnormalised": "**Level 3 (Fast Charging):** Also known as DC Fast Charging, this is the quickest way to replenish your EV's battery. Found at dedicated charging stations along highways like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, it can add 80% charge in as little as 30 minutes. Ideal for long journeys, allowing you to grab a quick chai break while your Mahindra XUV400 gets a boost. Keep an eye out for charging stations offering CCS and CHAdeMO connectors.", "normalised": "**Level three (Fast Charging):** Also known as D C Fast Charging, this is the quickest way to replenish your E V's battery.

{"unnormalised": "Before buying an EV, research the charging infrastructure in your area. Companies like Tata Power and Ather Energy are rapidly expanding their charging networks across India. Also, keep in mind your driving habits. If you primarily drive within the city (e.g., less than 50 km per day), slow charging at home might suffice. However, frequent road trips from Chennai to Coimbatore on 15/08/2024 might necessitate access to fast charging stations.", "normalised": "Before buying an E V, research the charging infrastructure in your area.
