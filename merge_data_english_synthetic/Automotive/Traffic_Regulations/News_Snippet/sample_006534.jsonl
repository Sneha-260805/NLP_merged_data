Heard they're even using A I-powered cameras now - no escaping those guys! Fines are hefty, starting from rupee five hundred and going all the way up to a few thousand for repeat offenders. Think twice before showing off your driving skills, especially if you've had a bit too much biryani during this festive season.

Jai Hind!"}
