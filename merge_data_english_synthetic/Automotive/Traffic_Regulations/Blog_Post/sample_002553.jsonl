{"unnormalised": "One of the most fundamental aspects of Indian traffic regulations is adhering to lane discipline. While it might seem optional at times, staying within designated lanes improves traffic flow and reduces the risk of accidents. Remember that overtaking is generally done from the right, though exceptions exist depending on the specific road conditions and signage. For instance, near busy areas such as Chandni Chowk in Delhi, regulations are very strict.", "normalised": "One of the most fundamental aspects of Indian traffic regulations is adhering to lane discipline.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits are another critical aspect. These vary depending on the type of road and the vehicle. Generally, highways allow higher speeds, but always be mindful of posted signage. In urban areas like Chennai, the speed limit might be as low as 40 km/hr, especially during peak hours around 09:00 hrs. Fines for speeding can be substantial, and more importantly, exceeding the speed limit significantly increases the risk of accidents.", "normalised": "Speed limits are another critical aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond speed and lane discipline, other regulations are equally important. Always wear a helmet while riding a two-wheeler – it's not just about avoiding a fine of Rs. 1000; it's about protecting your life. Seatbelts are mandatory for all occupants of a car, and drunk driving is a serious offense with severe penalties. Remember the landmark Motor Vehicles Act amendment passed on 01/09/2019 which significantly increased fines for various traffic violations.", "normalised": "Beyond speed and lane discipline, other regulations are equally important.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding traffic signals is crucial. A red light means stop, a yellow light means proceed with caution if it is safe to do so, and a green light means you can proceed. However, always be aware of pedestrians and other vehicles before entering an intersection. Many cities now use CCTV cameras to monitor traffic and issue challans automatically, so vigilance is key. You can usually check challans online using your vehicle registration number. Be mindful of ‘no parking’ zones, especially around hospitals and schools. On certain days, like national holidays such as 26/01/1950, expect increased traffic enforcement. Familiarizing yourself with the rules outlined by organizations such as the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is essential for responsible driving and contributing to safer roads for everyone.", "normalised": "Understanding traffic signals is crucial.
