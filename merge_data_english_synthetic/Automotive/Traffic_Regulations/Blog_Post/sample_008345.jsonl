{"unnormalised": "Firstly, remember that driving licenses are mandatory. A valid license, issued by the RTO (Regional Transport Office) in your state, is your permission slip to operate a vehicle. Always carry it with you along with your vehicle's registration certificate (RC) and insurance papers. Driving without these can land you in trouble, including hefty fines – sometimes upwards of Rs. 5000!", "normalised": "Firstly, remember that driving licenses are mandatory.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits are crucial and vary depending on the road type and location. On highways like the Delhi-Jaipur highway, you might see limits of 80 km/hr for cars, but within city limits, especially near schools or residential areas, it could be as low as 30 km/hr. Pay attention to the signage – they're there for a reason. Keep an eye out especially around 11:00 hrs, when school zones can be particularly congested.", "normalised": "Speed limits are crucial and vary depending on the road type and location.

{"unnormalised": "Lane discipline is another often-overlooked aspect. Stick to the left lane unless overtaking. Avoid weaving in and out of traffic, which is not only dangerous but also incredibly frustrating for other drivers. The concept of keeping left came into effect during British rule, and remains a key aspect of our traffic system even today, on 15/08/1947!", "normalised": "Lane discipline is another often-overlooked aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Traffic signals are your best friends. Red means stop, yellow means prepare to stop (unless you're already too close to the intersection), and green means go – but only after ensuring it's safe to do so. Jumping a red light can result in a heavy fine and potential suspension of your license. Think of the consequences before you attempt a risky maneuver.", "normalised": "Traffic signals are your best friends.

{"unnormalised": "Wearing a seatbelt is non-negotiable for drivers and front-seat passengers. In many cities, it's now mandatory for rear passengers too. For two-wheeler riders, helmets are absolutely essential. A good quality helmet can be the difference between life and death in an accident. Police regularly conduct checks, especially during peak hours, say 17:00 hrs - 19:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Wearing a seatbelt is non-negotiable for drivers and front-seat passengers.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember the importance of road signs. Familiarize yourself with common signs like \"No Parking,\" \"U-Turn Prohibited,\" and \"Speed Breaker Ahead.\" Knowledge of these signs can help you anticipate potential hazards and navigate unfamiliar routes with confidence. The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in Delhi plays a key role in researching and recommending improvements to road safety measures, including signage.", "normalised": "Finally, remember the importance of road signs.
