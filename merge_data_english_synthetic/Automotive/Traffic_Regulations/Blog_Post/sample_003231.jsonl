Navigating Indian roads can feel like a video game sometimes, dodging auto-rickshaws, buses, and the occasional stray cow. But seriously, understanding traffic regulations is key to staying safe and avoiding a hefty challan (fine). Nobody wants to give up their weekend chai money for that, right?", "normalised": "Hey folks, Bangalore drivers especially, you know what I'm talking about!

It’s way safer. Speed limits are also crucial. On most city roads, it's probably around 40 km/hr, but check the specific signage. Ignoring those can lead to some serious consequences and a painful hole in your pocket (Rs. 2000 fine is common these days!).", "normalised": "Then there's the whole lane discipline thing.

Illegally parked vehicles are often towed away, and retrieving them can be a massive headache (and expensive – think around Rs. 1000 plus towing charges). And don't even think about parking on the footpath – that’s just inconsiderate to pedestrians trying to navigate those crowded streets.
