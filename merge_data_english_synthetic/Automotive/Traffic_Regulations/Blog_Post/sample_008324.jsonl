Breathalyzer tests are common, especially around weekends and public holidays like Diwali. The legal limit is very low, so it's best to avoid alcohol altogether if you're driving.", "normalised": "Wearing a helmet is mandatory for two-wheeler riders, and seatbelts are compulsory for drivers and front seat passengers.

And remember the 'chai break' we take on long drives; stay rested and avoid driving drowsy, especially after a long day like the one on 26/01/2024 (Republic Day). Drive safe, Jai Hind!
