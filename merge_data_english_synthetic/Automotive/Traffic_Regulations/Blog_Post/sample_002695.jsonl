But amidst the chaos, a framework of traffic regulations exists to ensure (relatively) safe and orderly movement. Understanding these rules is crucial, not just to avoid hefty fines and grumpy traffic police officers, but for the safety of yourself and others.", "normalised": "Driving in India, whether it’s a scooter in Mumbai or a Thar on the Leh-Manali highway, can feel like an adventure.

{"unnormalised": "First and foremost, remember the basics. Always carry your driving license, Registration Certificate (RC) of the vehicle, insurance papers, and Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate. These are your shields against unwanted attention, especially during surprise checks, like the ones often conducted around Diwali or Holi. Remember, these documents need to be readily available – no digging through a backpack at 23:00 hrs on a dark highway!", "normalised": "First and foremost, remember the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits vary depending on the road and vehicle type. Pay attention to signage. Over speeding can lead to challans, and in severe cases, license suspension.

{"unnormalised": "Drinking and driving is a strict no-no. Not only is it illegal and carries severe penalties, but it also puts lives at risk.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, be aware of specific local regulations. For example, some cities may have restrictions on parking in certain areas during peak hours, like around Connaught Place in Delhi between 09:00 hrs and 19:00 hrs. Familiarize yourself with these rules to avoid getting your vehicle towed. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, as they say. Keep learning, drive safe, and remember – every life matters.
