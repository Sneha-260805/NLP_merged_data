Speed limits are super important, especially in residential areas. You don't want to be that guy zooming through Sector 17 at 80 km/h, right? Gurgaon cops are pretty strict about that stuff these days.", "normalised": "First first, remember the basics.

Keep them in the car, digital copies are usually fine, but having physical copies is always a good backup, especially during random *naka bandi* checks. Dr. Patil from my apartment society learned that the hard way when he forgot his insurance certificate at home!", "normalised": "Then there's the whole document drama.

{"unnormalised": "Also, helmet for two-wheelers is non-negotiable! Doesn't matter if you're just popping down to the *kirana* store a few blocks away. Think of it as a stylish (debatable, I know) accessory rather than a hassle. And finally, parking! Look for designated parking areas. Don't be *that* guy who parks his Innova in a \"No Parking\" zone, blocking the entire road. You'll end up with a wheel clamp and a hefty fine, plus the wrath of Sharma Ji, who owns the corner *chai* stall and sees everything! Plus you may block a 100 sq ft of space for others to park. Safe driving, folks! And may the *challan* gods be ever in your favour.", "normalised": "Also, helmet for two-wheelers is non-negotiable!
