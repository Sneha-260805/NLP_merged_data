{"unnormalised": "**Lane Discipline:** While lane discipline may seem like a distant dream on some Indian roads, it's actually a rule. Overtaking should always be done from the right. The central lane is for general traffic flow, and the extreme left is often reserved for slow-moving vehicles like bullock carts or, sadly, sometimes parked vehicles. Expect to see some creativity here, especially near crowded markets in places like Chandni Chowk, Delhi!", "normalised": "**Lane Discipline:** While lane discipline may seem like a distant dream on some Indian roads, it's actually a rule.
