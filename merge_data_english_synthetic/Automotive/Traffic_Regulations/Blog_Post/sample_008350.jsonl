{"unnormalised": "Driving in India, especially in bustling cities like Mumbai or Delhi, can feel like navigating a complex dance. But beneath the seeming chaos lies a framework of traffic regulations designed, at least in theory, to keep everyone safe. Understanding these rules is crucial, not just for avoiding hefty fines but for contributing to a more orderly and safer driving environment for yourself and others.", "normalised": "Driving in India, especially in bustling cities like Mumbai or Delhi, can feel like navigating a complex dance.

{"unnormalised": "First and foremost, remember the basics. Driving on the left is the norm, a legacy from our British colonial past. Seatbelts are mandatory for both the driver and front passenger, a regulation often overlooked but enforced more strictly these days, especially after increased campaigns by the Road Transport Authority. Failing to comply can result in a challan (fine) issued even via CCTV cameras, a process becoming increasingly common across major cities.", "normalised": "First and foremost, remember the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits vary drastically depending on the type of road and the vehicle. On national highways, the limit can be around 80 km/hr for cars, but this decreases significantly in urban areas and school zones. Be especially vigilant during peak hours, say between 09:00 hrs and 11:00 hrs, when traffic police are more actively enforcing regulations. Remember that these limits are often reduced further during specific periods, like Diwali or Holi, to manage festival-related congestion. News reports often carry these changes in the days leading up to the festivals.", "normalised": "Speed limits vary drastically depending on the type of road and the vehicle.

{"unnormalised": "Signaling is another area where improvement is needed. Indicate your intentions clearly and well in advance. Use your indicators for lane changes, turns, and overtaking. Also, be aware of hand signals used by truck drivers and conductors, a long-standing tradition, especially on narrow roads in states like Rajasthan. These signals often indicate intentions that might not be apparent otherwise.", "normalised": "Signaling is another area where improvement is needed.

{"unnormalised": "Don't drink and drive! This is a no-brainer. The legal Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) limit is very low, and enforcement is becoming stricter. Participating in a road safety seminar is often mandated as part of the punishment for DUI offences. Think of it this way: reaching your destination safely is far more important than saving a few minutes. Remember the incident on 26/11/2008 in Mumbai; the resulting traffic chaos highlighted the importance of disciplined driving even more.", "normalised": "Don't drink and drive! This is a no-brainer.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, keep your vehicle documents (Registration Certificate, Insurance, Pollution Under Control Certificate) updated. Regularly renewing your car insurance is crucial, and fines for expired documents can be substantial. Always remember that following traffic rules is not just about avoiding fines; it’s about ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone on the road, from the auto-rickshaw driver in Chennai to the tourist bus heading to Agra on 15/08/2024. Let's strive for a more disciplined and accident-free driving experience in India, remembering the lessons from past incidents, even those as far back as 1947.", "normalised": "Finally, keep your vehicle documents (Registration Certificate, Insurance, Pollution Under Control Certificate) updated.
