{"unnormalised": "**Speed Limits:** Speed limits vary drastically depending on the type of road and vehicle. On expressways like the Yamuna Expressway, you might be permitted to drive at 100 kmph, while within city limits, the limit could be as low as 40 kmph. Pay close attention to signage – those white boards with red circles aren’t just decorations! Over-speeding is a major cause of accidents, especially after 22:00 hrs when visibility is reduced.", "normalised": "Speed Limits: Speed limits vary drastically depending on the type of road and vehicle.
