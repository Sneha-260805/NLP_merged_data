{"unnormalised": "Driving in India, especially in bustling cities like Mumbai or Delhi, can feel like navigating a chaotic dance. But beneath the apparent frenzy lies a framework of traffic regulations designed to keep everyone safe (or at least, safer!). Understanding these rules is crucial, not just to avoid hefty fines (which can easily reach Rs. 5000 for some violations) but also to contribute to a more organized and predictable road environment.", "normalised": "Driving in India, especially in bustling cities like Mumbai or Delhi, can feel like navigating a chaotic dance.

{"unnormalised": "Let's delve into some key aspects of Indian traffic regulations. First and foremost: always wear your seatbelt. This applies to both the driver and front-seat passenger. Since 2005, rear seatbelt usage is also encouraged and increasingly enforced, especially in larger cities. Helmets are mandatory for two-wheeler riders; no exceptions! The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and its subsequent amendments are the primary source of these regulations.", "normalised": "Let's delve into some key aspects of Indian traffic regulations.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits are a constant source of confusion. On highways, the speed limit can vary depending on the type of vehicle and the road conditions. Usually, it's around 80 km/h for cars and less for heavy vehicles like trucks and buses. Within city limits, this drastically reduces to 40-50 km/h. Keep an eye out for signboards – they're your best friend!", "normalised": "Speed limits are a constant source of confusion.

{"unnormalised": "Another vital aspect is lane discipline. While it might seem optional, sticking to your lane significantly reduces accidents. Overtaking from the left is generally discouraged and can result in a challan.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the crucial issue of driving under the influence. Driving after consuming alcohol is a serious offense, and the penalties are severe, including imprisonment and license suspension. Breathalyzer tests are common during late-night checks, especially around popular entertainment areas. The legal limit is quite low, so it's best to avoid drinking altogether before driving.", "normalised": "Then there's the crucial issue of driving under the influence.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, be aware of local regulations. Some cities have specific rules regarding parking, one-way streets, and restricted zones. Familiarize yourself with these rules before venturing out. Pay attention to traffic signals; jumping a red light can land you in serious trouble, especially with increased CCTV surveillance. Remember Republic Day is on 26/01; expect heavier traffic in Delhi then. The Police HQ opens for complaints at 09:00 hrs every day. The RTO office has scheduled learner's license tests on 12/05/2024.
