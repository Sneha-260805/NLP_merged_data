{"unnormalised": "Driving in India, whether it's a Tata Nano zipping through Mumbai traffic or a Royal Enfield cruising down the highway to Ladakh, can be quite an experience. But amidst the chaos, understanding and adhering to traffic regulations is paramount for your safety and the safety of others. These regulations aren’t just arbitrary rules; they're designed to bring some order to our roads.", "normalised": "Driving in India, whether it is a Tata Nano zipping through Mumbai traffic or a Royal Enfield cruising down the highway to Ladakh, can be quite an experience.

{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you need is a valid driving license. Did you know that the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 governs much of our traffic law? Make sure your license is up-to-date and reflects the type of vehicle you're driving. Renewals are crucial – driving with an expired license can lead to hefty fines. Remember Ramesh Sharma from Delhi, who learned this the hard way when he was stopped at a checkpoint near India Gate on 26/01/2023?", "normalised": "One of the first things you need is a valid driving license.

{"unnormalised": "Speed limits are another critical aspect. These vary depending on the type of road and the vehicle. National Highways often have higher speed limits than city roads. Exceeding these limits can result in challans and, more importantly, increase the risk of accidents. In many urban areas, the speed limit can be as low as 40 kmph. Be aware of posted speed limit signs, often written in both English and Hindi.", "normalised": "Speed limits are another critical aspect. These vary depending on the type of road and the vehicle.

{"unnormalised": "Wearing a helmet while riding a two-wheeler is mandatory in most Indian states. Similarly, wearing a seatbelt in a car is not just a suggestion; it's the law. These simple actions can significantly reduce the severity of injuries in case of an accident.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding traffic signals is essential. Red means stop, green means go (when safe), and yellow means proceed with caution. Ignoring these signals is a common cause of accidents, especially at busy junctions like those in Bangalore. Penalties for jumping a red light are usually quite steep, and can even include temporary license suspension.", "normalised": "Understanding traffic signals is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember the importance of lane discipline. Overtaking should always be done from the right, and using your indicators is a must. Avoid unnecessary honking, especially in residential areas. Many cities now have \"Silent Zones\" around hospitals and schools where honking is strictly prohibited. Keep in mind the 'give way to the right' rule at unmarked junctions, a subtle but important aspect often overlooked. Let's all pledge to be responsible drivers, starting maybe from 09:00 hrs tomorrow, and contribute to safer roads for everyone! Remember, road safety is everyone's responsibility, from the auto-rickshaw driver in Chennai to the truck driver on the Grand Trunk Road.", "normalised": "Finally, remember the importance of lane discipline.
