{"unnormalised": "This post aims to shed some light on key traffic regulations you should be aware of. First and foremost, always remember to drive on the left side of the road – a rule dating back to British rule! Speed limits vary depending on the type of road and vehicle. On national highways, the limit can be around 80-100 kmph for cars, but it's usually lower for trucks and buses. Within city limits, like in Delhi or Chennai, speeds are typically restricted to 40-60 kmph. Pay attention to posted signs, especially near school zones and residential areas like Anna Nagar.", "normalised": "This post aims to shed some light on key traffic regulations you should be aware of.

{"unnormalised": "Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory for drivers and front-seat passengers and is now increasingly enforced for rear-seat passengers as well. Not wearing one can attract a fine, and more importantly, drastically reduces your chances of survival in an accident. Similarly, helmets are compulsory for two-wheeler riders and pillion riders. Ignoring this, especially in chaotic cities like Bangalore, can have severe consequences.", "normalised": "Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory for drivers and front-seat passengers and is now increasingly enforced for rear-seat passengers as well.

But remember, watch out for pedestrians and other vehicles before proceeding, even on a green light. Many junctions now have automated traffic surveillance, so don't even think about jumping that red light!", "normalised": "Regarding signals, red means stop, yellow means prepare to stop (or proceed with caution if you’re already past the stop line), and green means go.

{"unnormalised": "Driving under the influence of alcohol is strictly prohibited. Breathalyzer tests are common, and the penalties are severe. Think twice before you drink and drive – it’s never worth it. Also, be mindful of honking. Excessive honking is a common nuisance, especially in densely populated areas like Chandni Chowk in Delhi. Use it judiciously, only to alert other drivers of your presence.", "normalised": "Driving under the influence of alcohol is strictly prohibited.
