This involves rigorous testing, often conducted in challenging terrains like the Thar desert or the Himalayan foothills. Prototypes are meticulously refined based on these tests, and consumer clinics are conducted to gauge public reaction to design and features. Remember the buzz around the XUV700 launch? A lot of groundwork went in before that unveiling.", "normalised": "Firstly, the pre-launch phase is crucial.
