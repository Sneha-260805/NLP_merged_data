{"unnormalised": "Simply put, a vehicle launch is the official unveiling of a new or significantly updated vehicle model to the public.

{"unnormalised": "The price reveal is usually the most nail-biting part. Factors like the cost of raw materials (steel, aluminum, etc.), production expenses, government taxes, and competition all play a role in determining the final ex-showroom price. A competitive price can make or break a new car’s success. Remember when Tata launched the Nano at Rs. 1 Lakh? It created a global sensation! The launch date is crucial, often coinciding with auspicious dates like Diwali or Dussehra for maximum impact. Many launches happen around 11:00 hrs on auspicious days.", "normalised": "The price reveal is usually the most nail biting part.

Customers can finally experience the vehicle firsthand and decide if it lives up to the hype. Deliveries typically commence a few weeks after the launch. For example, pre-booking for the upcoming Maruti Suzuki Jimny started on 15/01/2023 and deliveries are expected sometime in June. Don't forget the importance of after-sales service – a reliable network of service centers across India is crucial for long-term success. So, next time you hear about a new vehicle launch, remember that it's much more than just a fancy unveiling. It’s a complex process with significant implications for the entire automotive industry. One example is how the Tata Punch EV which was launched on 05/03/2024 is currently doing.", "normalised": "Following the launch, the focus shifts to test drives, media reviews, and dealership visits.
