{"unnormalised": "The launch event itself is a spectacle. Held in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, or Chennai, it usually involves a high-profile celebrity, industry experts, and of course, the unveiling of the vehicle. The technical specifications, price (starting from Rs. 7,99,999!), and key features are revealed with much fanfare. Pay attention to the fine print though.

Reputable automotive publications like Overdrive and Autocar India will put the vehicles through rigorous testing, evaluating performance, fuel efficiency (often measured in kmpl or km/kg for CNG vehicles), and ride quality. Look out for independent reviews too. Don’t just rely on the manufacturer’s claims. Consider the feedback from everyday drivers.
