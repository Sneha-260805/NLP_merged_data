{"unnormalised": "First comes the concept. Manufacturers like Tata Motors brainstorm ideas, often based on market research, looking at what the Indian consumer wants.

Launch events often happen around auspicious dates, like Dussehra or Diwali, to capitalize on the festive mood. The launch price is critical.

{"unnormalised": "Vehicle launches aren’t just about unveiling a product; they're about carefully orchestrated campaigns designed to capture the Indian consumer's imagination (and wallet!). The price is often revealed on D-Day (e.g. on 01/12/2023), with different variants being priced according to features and engine options. Getting this right is crucial for success in the competitive Indian automotive market, where a difference of Rs. 10,000 can sway a buyer's decision. Often you will see variants offering extra comfort for long drives like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, targeting the intercity traveller.", "normalised": "Vehicle launches aren’t just about unveiling a product; they're about carefully orchestrated campaigns designed to capture the Indian consumer's imagination (and wallet!).
