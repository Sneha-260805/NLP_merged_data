{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the launch date itself is crucial. Companies meticulously plan this, considering auspicious dates (sometimes consulting a Pandit!) and avoiding clashes with major festivals like Diwali or Holi. Remember the Tata Nano launch? All eyes were on that one! A specific time, like 11:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, is often selected for press conferences and unveilings.", "normalised": "Firstly, the launch date itself is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the date, the features and specifications are, of course, paramount. Pay close attention to the engine type, mileage (often quoted in kmpl), and safety features like airbags and ABS. Don't be swayed by just the marketing jargon; do your research. Check reviews from trusted sources like Overdrive or Autocar India. The ARAI fuel efficiency figures, while useful for comparison, might not reflect real-world driving conditions in cities like Mumbai or Delhi.", "normalised": "Beyond the date, the features and specifications are, of course, paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Pricing is another critical aspect. Initial launch prices are often introductory, potentially increasing later. Keep an eye out for ex-showroom prices versus on-road prices, as the latter includes registration fees, insurance, and other charges. Launch events frequently highlight the base model's price, which may lack essential features. Financing options are usually announced, with EMIs starting from specific amounts. A lot of people check that!", "normalised": "Pricing is another critical aspect. Initial launch prices are often introductory, potentially increasing later.

A launch in Chennai might signify the vehicle's focus on the South Indian market, while a launch near the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) in Pune could indicate a technical focus.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the location of the launch itself often holds significance.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to consider the test drive availability. While the launch might be exciting, nothing beats experiencing the vehicle firsthand. Book a test drive as soon as possible, ideally within a few days of the launch (e.g., by 30/01/2024, if possible!). Don't be afraid to ask questions about the waiting period (often significant, especially for popular models), service intervals (in km or time), and the availability of spare parts. Sometimes dealers offer launch-day specific offers, so keep an eye out. Good luck with your new ride, and remember – *gaadi dekh ke, samajh ke lo!* (See the car, understand it, then buy it!). The price may be around Rs. 8 lakhs or more for a decent car.", "normalised": "Finally, remember to consider the test drive availability.
