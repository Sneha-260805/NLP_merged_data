{"unnormalised": "First, consider the timing. Launches are rarely random. Often, they’re strategically placed around festive seasons like Diwali or Dussehra, capitalizing on the increased consumer spending. Think about it: launching a family SUV just before the school year starts makes perfect sense. Keep an eye out for the launch date announcements, often teased weeks in advance. A recent launch, say on 26/01/2024 (Republic Day), of a \"Made in India\" SUV would carry extra weight.", "normalised": "First, consider the timing. Launches are rarely random.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the pricing. The ex-showroom price, the on-road price, EMI options – all these are crucial. Companies like Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra & Mahindra often use competitive pricing strategies to gain market share. Remember the buzz around the Tata Nano's initial launch, promising a car for around Rs. 1 lakh? While that didn't quite pan out as expected, it highlights the significance of price points in India. Don't forget to factor in registration charges, insurance (ICICI Lombard is a common choice!), and road tax.", "normalised": "Then there's the pricing.

{"unnormalised": "Next, focus on the features. Is it just a facelift or a completely new generation? What about safety features? Airbags, ABS, EBD are becoming standard, but are they offering advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)? The features list directly relates to value for money. Keep a lookout for innovations like connected car technology – now almost a prerequisite for young buyers.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, consider the \"Indian-ness.\" Does the vehicle resonate with Indian sensibilities? Fuel efficiency (km/l matters!), ground clearance (for those bumpy village roads), and boot space (for that family road trip to Rajasthan) are all important factors. Automakers increasingly involve Indian institutions like IIT Madras in R&D for local needs. Launch events often feature Bollywood celebrities, adding to the glamour and appeal. Remember the 11:00 hrs launch of the new Mahindra Scorpio-N – a testament to rugged Indian SUVs? Or the expected debut of a certain premium hatchback on 15/08/2024?
