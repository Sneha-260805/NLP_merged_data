{"unnormalised": "One crucial element is the technical specifications. While manufacturers often highlight performance figures like horsepower and mileage (kmpl), it's vital to look deeper. Consider the engine displacement (cc), safety features (like airbags and ABS), and the overall build quality. Don’t just take the company’s word for it; look for independent reviews and crash test ratings. Remember the Maruti 800 launch back in 1983? A game changer, but safety standards have evolved significantly since then!", "normalised": "One crucial element is the technical specifications.

Compare the on-road price across different dealerships in your city. Keep an eye out for special Diwali offers, typically announced around October-November. The launch of the Mahindra Scorpio N on 27/06/2022, for example, saw a frenzy of bookings, largely driven by its competitive pricing.", "normalised": "Price is, of course, a major deciding factor.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the specs and price, the launch event itself offers valuable insights. Watch out for presentations that showcase the vehicle's key features and target audience. Does it cater to city commutes like the new Tata Tiago EV, or is it geared towards off-roading adventures like the Mahindra Thar? The time of the launch is also telling. A launch scheduled at 11:00 hrs suggests a focus on attracting business professionals, while a 15/08/2023 launch might be tied to leveraging patriotic sentiment. Many manufacturers time their launches with auspicious days, according to the Hindu calendar.", "normalised": "Beyond the specs and price, the launch event itself offers valuable insights.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, a vehicle launch is a marketing exercise. While it's exciting, remember to do your research and make an informed decision based on your needs and budget.
