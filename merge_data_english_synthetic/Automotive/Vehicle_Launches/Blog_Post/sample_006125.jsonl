{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the 'launch' itself is a carefully orchestrated process. Automakers like Maruti Suzuki or Mahindra invest heavily in market research to gauge consumer demand. What features are Indian buyers craving? Fuel efficiency? Advanced safety features? A powerful engine for tackling those challenging ghat roads around Lonavala? The answers shape the vehicle's design and specifications.", "normalised": "Firstly, the 'launch' itself is a carefully orchestrated process.

Institutions like IIT Madras play a crucial role, contributing to research and development of indigenous technologies suitable for Indian road conditions. Think robust suspension systems, engines optimized for varying fuel qualities, and cooling systems designed to handle the scorching heat of Rajasthan.", "normalised": "Next comes the engineering prowess.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the pricing. A vehicle launch also involves shrewd financial planning. How will the price be positioned to compete with existing models? What will be the ex-showroom price in Delhi versus Mumbai? Offers and finance schemes are typically announced during the launch event itself, often revealing attractive EMI options, something crucial for the average Indian buyer. Remember that launch of the Tata Nano back on 10/01/2008? It was revolutionary precisely because of its ultra-affordable price point.", "normalised": "Then there's the pricing.

{"unnormalised": "Post-launch, the real work begins. Dealers across the country – from Kashmir to Kanyakumari – gear up to handle inquiries, test drives, and deliveries. Marketing campaigns ramp up, leveraging social media and traditional advertising to build brand awareness. A media drive, often scheduled a few weeks post-launch (say, around 15/05/2024 at 11:00 hrs), allows journalists to experience the vehicle firsthand and provide independent reviews.", "normalised": "Post-launch, the real work begins.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the success of a vehicle launch is measured over time. How many units are sold in the first month? How does the vehicle perform in real-world conditions, on the pothole-ridden streets of Bangalore, for example? What is the customer feedback like? A well-executed launch can propel a vehicle to success, while a misstep can lead to disappointing sales figures. Understanding all these aspects allows us to appreciate the intricacies behind that gleaming new vehicle unveiling at 14:30 hrs on 20/07/2024. Its price, let's say, starts at Rs. 8 Lakhs, with top models reaching Rs. 15 Lakhs and a range of 20 km/liter fuel efficiency. It's all part of the story.", "normalised": "Finally, the success of a vehicle launch is measured over time. How many units are sold in the first month?
