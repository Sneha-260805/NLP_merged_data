Keep an eye out for the ex-showroom price versus the on-road price which will include registration, insurance, and taxes.

Consider attending auto expos like the Auto Expo held in Greater Noida (usually around February) to see multiple launches and get a feel for the market.

And do remember that the specifications and features highlighted at the launch on, say, 15/08/2024, might differ slightly when the vehicle actually hits showrooms.
