{"unnormalised": "First, understand the pre-launch phase. Automakers spend months, sometimes years, conducting rigorous testing. Think scorching summers in Rajasthan, torrential monsoon testing near Cherrapunji, and high-altitude trials in Ladakh. These tests are crucial to ensure the vehicle can handle the diverse Indian terrain and weather conditions. Leaks are inevitable, creating initial buzz. Often manufacturers intentionally leak teasers to control the narrative and build anticipation, like releasing camouflaged images hinting at a specific feature.", "normalised": "First, understand the pre-launch phase.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the launch event itself, often a grand affair held in metropolitan cities like Mumbai or Delhi. These events, typically scheduled around auspicious dates or festivals (like Diwali around 20/10/2023), are designed to generate maximum media coverage. Expect celebrity endorsements (a Bollywood star gracing the stage is almost guaranteed!) and presentations packed with technical jargon. The all-important price announcement is the climax, and often, initial bookings open immediately, sometimes with limited-time introductory offers.", "normalised": "Then comes the launch event itself, often a grand affair held in metropolitan cities like Mumbai or Delhi.

{"unnormalised": "What should you, the potential buyer, be focusing on? Don't get swept up in the hype. Scrutinize the fine print regarding features, warranty, and after-sales service. The base model might be advertised at an attractive price (say Rs. 7 Lakhs), but essential features like airbags or ABS might only be available on higher variants costing significantly more (Rs. 10 Lakhs+).", "normalised": "What should you, the potential buyer, be focusing on?

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, pay attention to the delivery timelines. Demand often outstrips supply initially, leading to waiting periods extending for several months. It’s not uncommon to hear tales of customers waiting 6-8 months, especially for popular models. And remember to check out independent reviews by auto journalists from outlets like Autocar India or Overdrive before making a final decision. Visiting a local dealership, like Maruti Suzuki Arena in your city on 15/08/2024 at 11:00 hrs, is also highly recommended for a test drive. Don't forget to ask about the 'on-road' price, as this will include registration, insurance, and other charges. Finally, keep an eye out for government incentives like those promoting electric vehicles (EVs) – a segment poised for significant growth by 26/01/2025. This might significantly impact your purchase decision.", "normalised": "Furthermore, pay attention to the delivery timelines.
