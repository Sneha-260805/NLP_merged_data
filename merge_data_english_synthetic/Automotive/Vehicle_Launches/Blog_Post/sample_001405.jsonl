{"unnormalised": "But what goes into these launches? Let's break it down. First, there's the **market research**. Companies like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra spend months, sometimes years, understanding what the Indian consumer wants. Fuel efficiency remains king, but increasingly, features like connected car technology and advanced safety systems are playing a bigger role, especially among the younger generation. The feedback from places like IIT Delhi's automotive research department carries significant weight.", "normalised": "But what goes into these launches? Let's break it down.

{"unnormalised": "The **launch event itself** is usually a grand affair. Held in major cities like Mumbai or Chennai, these events feature industry experts, celebrities, and of course, the big reveal. Manufacturers often announce competitive pricing strategies, especially given the price sensitivity in the Indian market. Expect to hear phrases like \"starting from just Rs. 7.99 lakhs\" – a classic tactic to lure in buyers. Test drives typically follow soon after, often starting around 10:00 hrs on the launch day itself.", "normalised": "The **launch event itself** is usually a grand affair.

Tata Motors, for example, has been focusing heavily on improving its after-sales service in recent years. The first service for many brands is scheduled around 1000 km or three months, whichever comes first. The launch of a new model is often followed by a spike in demand, so expect waiting periods to extend beyond 01/01/2024 if you book immediately.", "normalised": "Finally, consider the **after-sales service and reliability**.
