{"unnormalised": "First comes the design phase. This isn't just about aesthetics; it’s about engineering, aerodynamics, and meeting the stringent safety standards set by bodies like ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) in Pune. Designers at companies like Tata Motors or Mahindra spend countless hours creating prototypes, often incorporating feedback from extensive consumer research. They might even consult traditional Vaastu principles for optimal placement of components within the vehicle!", "normalised": "First comes the design phase.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the testing phase. Vehicles undergo grueling trials under various conditions, from the scorching heat of Rajasthan to the high altitudes of Ladakh. They're tested for fuel efficiency (often measured in kmpl), performance, and reliability. These tests also help fine-tune features and address any potential issues. We often hear whispers of test mules being spotted near Chennai, heavily camouflaged to keep the design secret.", "normalised": "Then comes the testing phase.
