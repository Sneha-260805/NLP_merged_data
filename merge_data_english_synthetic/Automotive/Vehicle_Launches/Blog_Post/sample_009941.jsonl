{"unnormalised": "The big day! The official launch event, often held in a major city like Mumbai or Delhi, is a carefully orchestrated spectacle. Journalists, dealers, influencers, and potential customers are invited. The price is revealed (expect price announcements in Rs. lakhs!), key features are highlighted, and test drives are often offered. Remember the launch of the Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 in January 2023? A lot of fanfare!", "normalised": "The big day!

{"unnormalised": "Post-launch, the focus shifts to marketing and sales. Advertisements flood our screens, dealerships ramp up their efforts, and reviews start pouring in. Word-of-mouth, especially in closely-knit communities, plays a significant role. The success of a launch ultimately depends on how well the vehicle meets the needs and expectations of the Indian buyer. A crucial factor is also after-sales service. A robust service network is a must. Imagine buying a car in Kanpur and not having reliable service options nearby!", "normalised": "Post-launch, the focus shifts to marketing and sales.
