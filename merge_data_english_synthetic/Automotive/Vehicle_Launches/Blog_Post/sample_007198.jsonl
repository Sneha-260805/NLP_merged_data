{"unnormalised": "First, understand the different kinds of launches. There's the full-blown national launch, often held at a significant date, like perhaps around Diwali. Think of the buzz surrounding Maruti Suzuki's new models – a national event, often showcasing not just the car itself, but also the vision for the future of mobility in India. These often involve Bollywood celebrities and cost crores of Rupees.", "normalised": "First, understand the different kinds of launches.

{"unnormalised": "Technical specifications are crucial. Don't just focus on the horsepower; look at fuel efficiency (km/l), safety features (like the number of airbags), and the kind of technology integrated. Remember, Indian roads are unique, and a car performing well in Germany might struggle on a pothole-ridden street in Patna. Check out the torque figures – important for navigating ghat roads like those near Lonavala.", "normalised": "Technical specifications are crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, pay attention to the long-term implications. Is the manufacturer investing in local manufacturing? Does the vehicle support the \"Make in India\" initiative? Are there adequate service centers in your area? Consider the resale value – often a significant factor for Indian buyers. These are the questions that will ultimately determine whether a fancy launch translates into a worthwhile purchase. Even a small detail like the launch time 10/10/2023 11:00 hrs can influence public perception. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) plays a crucial role in certifying these vehicles. So, do your research, and happy motoring!", "normalised": "Finally, pay attention to the long-term implications. Is the manufacturer investing in local manufacturing?
