{"unnormalised": "Firstly, years of R&D, often involving institutions like IIT Madras for testing and material science, go into development. Then comes homologation - getting the car certified by agencies like ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) to meet Indian safety and emission standards.

Price announcements are strategically timed, often around auspicious festivals like Diwali, to capitalize on increased consumer spending. Expect initial waiting periods if the vehicle is a hit! We've seen that happen with the XUV700 and the Kia Seltos. It really is a huge coordinated effort, often involving thousands of people, to get that new car from the drawing board to your driveway. So, next time you see a vehicle launch, remember all the background work.", "normalised": "Finally, dealer training and service infrastructure are put in place before the official launch date.
