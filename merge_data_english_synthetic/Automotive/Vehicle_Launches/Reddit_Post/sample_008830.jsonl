This includes R&D, prototyping, testing in grueling conditions (Rajasthan summers anyone?), and ensuring it meets stringent safety norms (like Bharat NCAP).

Establishing a robust network of service centers across India (from Kashmir to Kanyakumari) to handle maintenance, repairs, and warranty claims is critical for long-term success. Launches in India can involve 1000s of km of test drives, and price adjustments of even Rs. 5,000 can be significant. It's a complex process, not just a fancy event!
