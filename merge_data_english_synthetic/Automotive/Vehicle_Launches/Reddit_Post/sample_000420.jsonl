{"unnormalised": "It's a far cry from just draping a silk cloth over a new model. It's a multi-stage process. First, there's rigorous testing – think ARAI mileage certification and grueling km runs through Rajasthan's deserts to test durability in extreme heat. Then, homologation, making sure it meets Indian regulations.

Does the car live up to the hype? The feedback, like a critical review in Filmfare, can make or break its success.
