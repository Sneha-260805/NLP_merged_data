{"unnormalised": "**Advantages:** Virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access to education, particularly for students in remote areas like Ladakh or the Northeast, breaking geographical barriers. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, often highlights how online courses can reach students underserved by traditional institutions. Cost-effectiveness is another major benefit. Instead of incurring expenses for physical infrastructure (renting a 2000 sq ft space in Mumbai, for example), resources can be channeled towards quality content creation and teacher training. Moreover, they promote individualized learning paces, allowing students like Rohan from Chennai to revisit lectures and materials as needed.", "normalised": "**Advantages:** Virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access to education, particularly for students in remote areas like Ladakh or the Northeast, breaking geographical barriers.

{"unnormalised": "**Disadvantages:** The digital divide in India remains a significant hurdle. Reliable internet access and devices (laptops, smartphones) are not universally available, creating an uneven playing field. Maintaining student engagement online is also challenging. Traditional classrooms offer a dynamic social interaction that's difficult to replicate virtually. Plus, the lack of direct oversight can lead to distractions and reduced accountability. The shift requires significant investment in training teachers to effectively use online tools and adapt their pedagogy. Issues such as cyber security and safeguarding student data must also be carefully addressed. Finally, concerns about the validity of online certifications and their acceptance by employers, compared to degrees from reputed institutions like JNU, persist. Think of the cost in Rs. and the effort required for ensuring the technology is inclusive.", "normalised": "**Disadvantages:** The digital divide in India remains a significant hurdle.
