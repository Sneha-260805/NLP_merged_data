For instance, they democratize access to quality education, bringing resources from institutions like IIT-Bombay to students in remote areas like, say, rural Bihar. Geographic constraints are no longer a barrier. Dr. Sharma, a renowned physics professor, can now teach students across the country without leaving his office.", "normalised": "Virtual classrooms offer numerous advantages.

Imagine a student struggling with algebra; instead of falling behind, they can re-watch the relevant lesson multiple times. This is a massive improvement over the traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these platforms facilitate personalized learning.
