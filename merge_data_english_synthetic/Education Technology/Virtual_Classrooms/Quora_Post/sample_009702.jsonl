{"unnormalised": "While the initial push was largely driven by the pandemic, the benefits are now becoming clearer. Virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access to quality education, especially for students in remote areas like Ladakh, who might otherwise face geographical barriers. Consider a student in a small village in Rajasthan now having access to lectures from Dr. Sharma at IIM Ahmedabad. This democratization of knowledge is significant.", "normalised": "While the initial push was largely driven by the pandemic, the benefits are now becoming clearer.

Reliable internet connectivity remains a hurdle too. The cost of devices and data packs can be a barrier for families with limited resources, despite government initiatives offering subsidized data plans.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

A spacious real classroom of 1000 sq ft can feel more immersive than staring at a screen all day. Maintaining focus can be tough, and the lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder social development.", "normalised": "Moreover, the effectiveness of virtual classrooms depends heavily on the quality of instruction and the engagement levels of students.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, virtual classrooms are a powerful tool, but their success hinges on addressing infrastructure challenges, improving digital literacy, and adapting pedagogical approaches to create engaging and effective online learning experiences. The future likely lies in a blended approach, incorporating the best of both virtual and physical classrooms. The cost, roughly Rs. 5,000 per student per year for a decent virtual platform, needs to be balanced with the benefits. We need more rigorous studies, perhaps by institutions like the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA), to truly understand the long-term impact.", "normalised": "Ultimately, virtual classrooms are a powerful tool, but their success hinges on addressing infrastructure challenges, improving digital literacy, and adapting pedagogical approaches to create engaging and effective online learning experiences.
