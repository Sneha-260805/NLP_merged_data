{"unnormalised": "From my perspective, while virtual classrooms offer incredible potential, they also present unique challenges. The accessibility to quality education in remote areas like, say, Arunachal Pradesh, can be significantly improved. Students in smaller towns like Meerut can access lectures from Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi without the logistical hurdles. Imagine the cost savings! We're talking about potentially reducing expenses on transportation and infrastructure – freeing up Rs. 50,000 per student per year, perhaps?", "normalised": "From my perspective, while virtual classrooms offer incredible potential, they also present unique challenges.
