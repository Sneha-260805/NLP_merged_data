A student in a remote village in Rajasthan can now access the same quality of education as someone in Delhi Public School, provided they have a stable internet connection and a device. This is a game-changer for bridging the educational gap. Consider, for example, the online coaching classes for IIT-JEE available to students in places like Patna at a fraction of the cost.", "normalised": "One key advantage is accessibility.

Moreover, the lack of face-to-face interaction can impact social development and the formation of strong teacher-student bonds, crucial aspects of the Indian Gurukul tradition. Practical subjects like engineering or medicine, requiring hands-on lab work, also pose logistical hurdles. A possible solution might be a blended learning approach, combining virtual lessons with periodic physical sessions at designated centers.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

We also need to address issues like online safety and data privacy. Ultimately, the future of education in India may lie in a thoughtful integration of virtual and traditional classrooms, starting from 01/01/2024. We need to carefully consider the pros and cons before fully embracing this new paradigm, aiming for a system that best serves the needs of all students by 17:00 hrs on 26/01/2024.
