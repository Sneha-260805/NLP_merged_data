They encompass a range of tools like interactive whiteboards, screen sharing, and integrated learning management systems (LMS). Think of BYJU’S or Vedantu, but scaled down for individual schools. This allows students from remote locations like Ladakh or the Sundarbans to access quality education that might otherwise be unavailable.", "normalised": "Virtual classrooms are not just about video conferencing.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the successful integration of virtual classrooms hinges on a strategic approach, combining technology with sound pedagogical practices. Think of it as blended learning – 70% online, 30% in-person for practical labs or group projects, perhaps meeting once a month on the 1st Sunday at 11:00 hrs. This model could revolutionize education for millions of students across India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, significantly impacting the nation's literacy rate and overall development. Are we ready to embrace this change?", "normalised": "Ultimately, the successful integration of virtual classrooms hinges on a strategic approach, combining technology with sound pedagogical practices.
