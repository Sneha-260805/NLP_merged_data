{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Okay folks, let's talk virtual classrooms! As someone who's seen my nephew, Rohan, attend online classes from his home in Bangalore to D P S East, I've got some thoughts. Honestly, they're a mixed bag. On one hand, Rohan can learn from some amazing teachers regardless of where he is physically. Imagine that – quality education even during those crazy Bangalore traffic jams! Plus, it's super convenient. No more early morning rush for mom! But... the screen time! My god, the screen time. Rohan spends almost eight hours a day glued to his laptop, which is definitely not ideal, even if some of it includes a virtual P T Class. Also, that personal connection, the adda with friends during lunch break - those things are missed. I think virtual classrooms are here to stay, especially for things like specialized coaching for I I T-J E E prep or learning a new language. But we need to find a better balance. Maybe shorter sessions, more interactive activities, and definitely more emphasis on off-screen learning. Like, go read a book under a Neem tree! Maybe celebrate Onam virtually with your classroom friends? Or even learn how to make Biryani online from a master chef! The possibilities are endless, we just need to use the tech wisely. What do you guys think? Anyone else having similar experiences in India? Let's share some ideas!"}
