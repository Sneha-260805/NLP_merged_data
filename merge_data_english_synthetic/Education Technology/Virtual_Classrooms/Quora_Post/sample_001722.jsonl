{"unnormalised": "Virtual classrooms have emerged as a significant force in education technology, particularly in a country as vast and diverse as India. One key benefit is accessibility. A student in a remote village in Rajasthan can now access lectures from IIT Delhi, something previously unimaginable. Consider students in rural areas like Barabanki, UP, now able to attend extra classes at 7:00 PM after tending to family responsibilities during the day. This flexibility is a game changer.", "normalised": "Virtual classrooms have emerged as a significant force in education technology, particularly in a country as vast and diverse as India.

While initial investment in infrastructure might be required, the long-term savings on physical infrastructure like classrooms and transportation can be substantial. The Covid-19 pandemic, which started affecting India around Feb 2020, accelerated the adoption of virtual learning platforms. Many schools swiftly transitioned to online classes.", "normalised": "Another advantage is cost-effectiveness.

This disparity can exacerbate existing inequalities. Furthermore, maintaining student engagement in a virtual environment can be challenging. Teachers need training to effectively use online tools and adapt their teaching styles. Some students also miss the crucial social interaction of a physical classroom. Consider exams scheduled on 26/01/2024 - power outages might affect some students in poorer areas. Furthermore, the lack of hands-on lab work can be problematic for STEM subjects. Effective implementation requires a multi-pronged approach, focusing on infrastructure development, teacher training, and addressing the digital divide, all to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, can benefit from this technology. Moreover, there are data privacy concerns that need addressing, a concern particularly highlighted after recent cyber security breaches across the country.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
