{"unnormalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access to quality education. Students in remote villages can now attend lectures delivered by professors from IIT Bombay or AIIMS Delhi, something unimaginable just a decade ago. This democratizes learning and breaks down geographical barriers. Furthermore, features like recorded lectures allow students to revisit concepts at their own pace, crucial for mastering complex subjects like engineering mathematics. Imagine a student prepping for JEE Mains being able to review a lesson at 23:00 hrs after a long day.", "normalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access to quality education.

Leveraging virtual classrooms for subjects where specialized expertise is scarce, while maintaining traditional classroom settings for subjects requiring hands-on learning or fostering collaborative skills.
