{"unnormalised": "Virtual classrooms offer immense potential. They break geographical barriers, allowing a student in Chennai to learn from a Professor at IIT Delhi. This is particularly beneficial for accessing specialized subjects not readily available everywhere. Think Sanskrit classes offered by experts in Varanasi, or advanced coding courses streamed from Bangalore’s tech hubs. We saw a massive surge in their adoption around March 2020.", "normalised": "Virtual classrooms offer immense potential.

The answer, I believe, lies in a blended approach. Utilizing virtual classrooms to supplement traditional learning, providing access to resources like recorded lectures available 24/7, and incorporating regular in-person interactions is key. For instance, a concept could be introduced in a virtual class at 10:00 AM on 26/01/2024, and then debated and practically applied in a physical classroom the next day. The key is to harness the power of technology while retaining the best aspects of traditional Indian pedagogy. We need to ensure equitable access and focus on quality content creation. Perhaps a national policy framework, like the National Education Policy 2020, needs further refinement to specifically address the ethical and pedagogical considerations surrounding virtual classrooms.
