{"unnormalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer tremendous potential. They can reach students in remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, providing access to quality teaching from experienced educators, perhaps even Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi. This is particularly beneficial for subjects like engineering and medicine, where specialized faculty might be scarce in smaller towns. The flexibility allows students like Rohan from Jaipur to learn at their own pace, balancing studies with other responsibilities. It also opens doors to affordable education, potentially costing significantly less than traditional schooling, perhaps saving families Rs. 50,000 per year.", "normalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer tremendous potential.

{"unnormalised": "However, the digital divide remains a significant hurdle. Reliable internet access and appropriate devices are not universally available. Imagine a student in a rural village in Bihar struggling with a slow internet connection in a small 100 sq ft home. Moreover, the lack of in-person interaction can impact social development and create challenges for hands-on learning, particularly in subjects like science and practical arts. We need robust infrastructure and support systems to ensure that virtual classrooms genuinely bridge the gap and don't widen it further. The focus should be on creating truly inclusive EdTech solutions for everyone in India.", "normalised": "However, the digital divide remains a significant hurdle.
