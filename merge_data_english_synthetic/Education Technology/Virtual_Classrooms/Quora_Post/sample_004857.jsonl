{"unnormalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer unparalleled accessibility. Students in remote areas like Ladakh can now access quality instruction from Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi, something previously unimaginable. They also provide flexibility, allowing students juggling work and family responsibilities in cities like Mumbai to pursue further studies. The potential cost savings, considering expenses like hostel fees and transportation (Rs. 2,000 - Rs. 3,000 per month for some), are also significant. Further, virtual classrooms can accommodate larger class sizes, potentially increasing access to popular courses. Think of accommodating 500+ students in a history lecture from a renowned professor at JNU, all from the comfort of their homes!", "normalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer unparalleled accessibility.
