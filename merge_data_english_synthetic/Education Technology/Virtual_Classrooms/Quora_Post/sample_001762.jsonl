{"unnormalised": "One key advantage is accessibility. Students in remote villages of Rajasthan, previously limited by geographical constraints, can now access quality instruction from experienced teachers, perhaps even preparing for competitive exams like NEET or JEE. This democratizes learning and addresses the disparity in educational resources across India. Think of a student in a village 50 km from Jaipur accessing a top tutor at 10:00 hrs.", "normalised": "One key advantage is accessibility.

Moreover, integrating virtual learning with traditional classroom teaching could be the ideal approach, ensuring a blended model that leverages the strengths of both. Consider the impact of AR/VR integration by 26/01/2025. Perhaps a review is warranted by 15/08/2024 to assess the real impact after some years of implementation.
