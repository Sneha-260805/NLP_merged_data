A student in a remote village in Rajasthan can now access the same quality instruction as a student in Mumbai. Think of Dr. Sharma, a renowned physics professor from IISc Bangalore, delivering lectures to students across the country via a platform like Zoom or Google Meet. This is democratization of education in action.", "normalised": "what are the key benefits? virtual classrooms break down geographical barriers. a student in a remote village in rajasthan can now access the same quality instruction as a student in mumbai. think of doctor sharma, a renowned physics professor from I I S C bangalore, delivering lectures to students across the country via a platform like zoom or google meet. this is democratization of education in action."}

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, virtual classrooms, with proper implementation and addressing these challenges, have the potential to revolutionize education, making it more accessible, engaging, and effective. It's about creating a classroom, potentially 500 sq ft or more, that exists not in brick and mortar but in the digital realm. Investments in infrastructure (e.g., better internet connectivity) and teacher training are crucial. We are talking about potentially spending Rs. 20,000 per student or more to enable this transition. And let's not forget the importance of addressing issues like eye strain. It's not just about technology; it's about pedagogy and student well-being, ensuring a holistic learning experience.", "normalised": "ultimately, virtual classrooms, with proper implementation and addressing these challenges, have the potential to revolutionize education, making it more accessible, engaging, and effective. it's about creating a classroom, potentially five hundred square feet or more, that exists not in brick and mortar but in the digital realm. investments in infrastructure (for example, better internet connectivity) and teacher training are crucial. we are talking about potentially spending rupee twenty thousand per student or more to enable this transition. and let's not forget the importance of addressing issues like eye strain. it's not just about technology; it's about pedagogy and student well-being, ensuring a holistic learning experience."}
