{"unnormalised": "On the positive side, virtual classrooms offer unprecedented accessibility. A student in, say, a remote village in Rajasthan, can now access lectures from Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi. This democratizes education and breaks geographical barriers. The flexibility of learning at one's own pace and revisiting recorded sessions is also a significant advantage. Costs can be reduced, as students save on transportation and potentially tuition fees. Plus, the use of interactive tools and simulations can enhance engagement, making learning more effective.", "normalised": "On the positive side, virtual classrooms offer unprecedented accessibility.

Perhaps a blended approach, combining online and offline learning, is the most sustainable solution. Ensuring even a small rural school gets, say, 1000 sq ft, equipped with computers will be beneficial in the long run. The govt. should invest Rs. 50,000 Cr in this effort.
