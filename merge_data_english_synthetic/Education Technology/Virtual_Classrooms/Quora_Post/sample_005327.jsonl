{"unnormalised": "From my perspective, the potential is immense. Imagine a student in a remote village in Rajasthan accessing a lecture by a renowned professor from IIT Delhi, all from their laptop. This level of accessibility is groundbreaking. Virtual classrooms also offer personalized learning experiences through recorded sessions, allowing students to revisit complex topics at their own pace. This is especially helpful for students struggling with subjects like Maths or Science. Think of little Priya from Kanpur being able to review her trigonometry lessons multiple times until she grasps the concepts fully.", "normalised": "From my perspective, the potential is immense.

{"unnormalised": "I believe a hybrid model, blending the best of traditional and virtual learning, holds the most promise for India. This approach would allow us to leverage the benefits of technology while addressing the existing disparities. I'm interested to see how educational institutions adapt. Perhaps the government's NITI Aayog can champion initiatives to bridge this digital divide. A national curriculum framework incorporating virtual learning elements, perhaps implemented by 01/01/2025, could be a game-changer. The deadline for feedback submissions is 17:00 hrs on 30/06/2024. Let's discuss the implications, considering factors like student-teacher ratios, assessment methods, and even the psychological impact of prolonged screen time. Is India ready for a significant shift to virtual classrooms by 15/08/2030?
