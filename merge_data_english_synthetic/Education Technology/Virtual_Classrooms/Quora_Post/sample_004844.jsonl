Students like Anjali can revisit complex concepts at their own pace, improving comprehension. However, consistent internet connectivity remains a challenge in many areas. Government initiatives and community efforts are crucial to address this digital divide and ensure equitable access to online learning resources for all. The effectiveness ultimately depends on bridging that gap and ensuring students like Ravi in rural Tamil Nadu are not left behind."}
