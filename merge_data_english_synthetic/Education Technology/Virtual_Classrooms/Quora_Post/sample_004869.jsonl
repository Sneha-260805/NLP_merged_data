{"unnormalised": "However, the potential benefits are immense. Virtual classrooms can bring high-quality education to students in geographically isolated areas, offer access to specialized subjects not available locally, and provide personalized learning experiences. The cost per sq ft for setting up a basic smart classroom can be significantly lower than building a new physical school. This could dramatically impact education in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We must also consider the socio-economic impact, especially for students from lower-income families who may lack access to quiet study spaces or electricity. The initial investment might seem high (Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 20,000 per student for devices and connectivity), but the long-term returns on education are invaluable. Overall, virtual classrooms hold immense promise but require thoughtful implementation and continuous monitoring to ensure equitable access and effective learning outcomes for all Indian students.", "normalised": "However, the potential benefits are immense.
