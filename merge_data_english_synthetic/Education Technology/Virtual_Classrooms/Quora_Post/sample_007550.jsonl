{"unnormalised": "Challenges include maintaining student engagement, especially with younger learners. Teachers from institutions like IIT-Bombay are experimenting with innovative methods like gamification and interactive simulations to address this. Ensuring equitable access to devices and internet for all students, especially before crucial deadlines like 31/12/2024, is paramount. Effective teacher training on utilising these technologies is also essential. We need to assess the long-term impact of virtual learning on student well-being, and social development. A study conducted at IIM-Bangalore on 15/08/2023 revealed mixed results regarding student satisfaction.", "normalised": "Challenges include maintaining student engagement, especially with younger learners.
