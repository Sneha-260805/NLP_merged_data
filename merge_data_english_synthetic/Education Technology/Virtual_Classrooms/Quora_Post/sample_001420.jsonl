A hybrid model, combining the best aspects of both traditional and virtual learning, might be the most effective approach for India. Investment in infrastructure, costing approximately Rs. 50,000 per classroom (assuming a 500 sq ft space with required tech), is crucial. The future of education lies in leveraging technology to create inclusive and effective learning environments for all.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the success of virtual classrooms hinges on effective implementation and teacher training.
