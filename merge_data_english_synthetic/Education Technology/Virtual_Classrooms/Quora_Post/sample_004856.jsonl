Students in remote areas like Ladakh can now attend lectures from prestigious institutions like IIT Delhi, a scenario previously unimaginable. Dr. Sharma, a professor from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), can now reach a pan-Indian audience without geographical limitations. Think of the scalability! A single lecture can cater to thousands, potentially reducing infrastructural costs (think fewer buildings to maintain, less land required - maybe saving 10,000 sq ft of construction).", "normalised": "On one hand, virtual classrooms offer unparalleled access.
