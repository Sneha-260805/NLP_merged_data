Students from remote areas like those in the Himalayan foothills near Shimla, who might struggle to reach a physical school due to geographical constraints or socio-economic factors, can now access quality education. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, highlighted this during a recent webinar, noting that virtual classrooms can bridge the educational gap for marginalized communities.", "normalised": "One significant advantage is accessibility.

A high-quality laptop can cost Rs. 30,000 or more, a significant expense for many families. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation and reduced engagement, impacting the overall learning experience. Teachers in institutions like St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, are experimenting with innovative teaching methods to address this.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, virtual classrooms have the potential to revolutionize education in India, expanding access and creating new learning opportunities. But careful planning, infrastructure development, and innovative pedagogical approaches are crucial for realizing this potential. The Government's initiatives to provide affordable internet access are a welcome step in the right direction. Perhaps blended learning, combining the best of both physical and virtual classrooms, offers the optimal solution for many students, providing access to high quality teaching with sufficient lab space (say 500 sq ft) for practical work.", "normalised": "Ultimately, virtual classrooms have the potential to revolutionize education in India, expanding access and creating new learning opportunities.
