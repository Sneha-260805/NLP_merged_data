{"unnormalised": "Scholarship portals aggregate information about various scholarships, fellowships, and grants available to students. They offer a centralized platform to search, filter, and apply for opportunities based on academic qualifications, field of study, location (e.g., scholarships for students from Rajasthan), and other criteria. For instance, a student from IIT Delhi looking for a scholarship to study AI could easily filter through available options, potentially discovering opportunities they wouldn't have found otherwise. Many portals even send notifications about new scholarships matching a user’s profile. This is particularly helpful given that many deadlines, like the last date to apply for the 'Inspire Scholarship' closing on 30/09/2024, are often missed.", "normalised": "Scholarship portals aggregate information about various scholarships, fellowships, and grants available to students.

Others may charge fees or require subscriptions, while still promising \"exclusive\" scholarships.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, competition remains intense. Just because a scholarship is listed on a portal doesn’t guarantee you’ll get it. A strong application, recommendation letters, and often a stellar academic record are still paramount. Also, remember to keep an eye out for regional scholarship opportunities available for students from specific states. These might be announced around significant dates like Republic Day (26/01) or Independence Day (15/08/1947).", "normalised": "Furthermore, competition remains intense.

Use them judiciously, combine them with other research methods (talking to your professors, checking university websites directly), and be sure to start your search well in advance, perhaps setting aside time every Saturday at 09:00 hrs to explore options. With a strategic approach, Indian students can significantly increase their chances of securing the funding they need to achieve their academic goals. Good luck!", "normalised": "Ultimately, scholarship portals are a valuable tool, but they shouldn't be the *only* tool in your scholarship search arsenal.
