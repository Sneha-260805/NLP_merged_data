{"unnormalised": "Gone are the days of physically scouring newspaper clippings and college notice boards for scholarship announcements. These platforms, like Buddy4Study and Vidya Lakshmi (a Government of India initiative), consolidate information from various sources – government agencies, private organizations, and educational institutions. Students can filter opportunities based on their academic background, field of study, location (think from Jammu to Kanyakumari), and even caste/category as relevant for specific schemes. This targeted approach saves students precious time and effort. Imagine a student from a small town like Madurai accessing a niche scholarship for Biotechnology research at IIT Delhi through a portal – a scenario virtually impossible just a few years ago.", "normalised": "Gone are the days of physically scouring newspaper clippings and college notice boards for scholarship announcements.

Regular monitoring and validation of listed scholarships are crucial to avoid misleading students. Furthermore, digital literacy remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas. Initiatives like digital literacy camps at 09:00 hrs in villages near Kolkata are essential to empower students to effectively utilize these platforms. Looking ahead, integrating AI-powered recommendation engines and personalized guidance systems by, say, 2024, could further enhance the utility of these scholarship portals, ensuring that talented students like Priya Sharma from Jaipur, aiming for a medical degree, don't miss out on crucial funding opportunities.
