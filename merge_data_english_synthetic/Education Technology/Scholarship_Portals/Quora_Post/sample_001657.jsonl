{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Digital literacy is still a barrier for many, particularly in rural India. Furthermore, the quality and accuracy of information on some platforms can be inconsistent. Verification processes and user-friendly interfaces are critical for ensuring that these portals truly empower students. Imagine the relief a student appearing for their IIT-JEE exams feels knowing that financial constraints won’t derail their dreams because they found a suitable scholarship on a reliable portal! The potential to boost enrollment in institutions like IIT Madras is immense, provided access and usability are prioritized. This technology, if implemented correctly, can be a game-changer for education in India.", "normalised": ""}
