The portals also streamline the application process, often allowing for online submissions and document uploads, saving time and rupee five hundred application fees that can be a burden. They offer filters based on criteria such as caste-based reservations, making it simpler to find category-specific scholarships. These portals aren't perfect, with issues like outdated information and reliance on internet access still existing, but they represent a monumental leap forward. They are effectively leveling the playing field and helping countless students achieve their educational aspirations."}
