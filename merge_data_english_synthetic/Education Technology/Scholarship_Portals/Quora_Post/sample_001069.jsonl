{"unnormalised": "Effectiveness varies, of course. A well-designed portal consolidates scholarships from various sources – government (like the National Scholarship Portal), private organizations (Tata Trusts, Reliance Foundation), and educational institutions like IIT Madras or Delhi University. A good portal offers advanced search filters based on criteria like caste, category, academic merit (percentage marks, say 85%), and course of study (B.Tech., MBBS). They also send out customized alerts about new scholarships.", "normalised": "Effectiveness varies, of course.
