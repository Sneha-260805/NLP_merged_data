Are these EdTech platforms truly helping deserving candidates, or are they adding another layer of complexity to an already challenging process?", "normalised": "On the one hand, these portals offer a centralized location to discover numerous scholarships, ranging from merit-based awards to those targeting specific communities or fields of study. Think of a young aspiring doctor like Priya from Patna, dreaming of studying at A I I M S. Instead of scouring individual university websites and newspapers, she can use a portal to find scholarships that specifically cater to M B B S aspirants. This convenience is a significant advantage."}
