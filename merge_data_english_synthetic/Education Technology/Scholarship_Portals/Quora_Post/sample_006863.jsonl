{"unnormalised": "These portals, such as Buddy4Study, Vidyadhan, and even government initiatives like the National Scholarship Portal (NSP), aggregate information on a wide range of scholarships, streamlining the application process. They often provide filters based on criteria like caste, income, academic performance, and specific fields of study (Engineering, Medicine, etc.). Imagine a student in rural Bihar, who previously relied solely on word-of-mouth or newspaper advertisements, now having access to hundreds of scholarship opportunities at their fingertips.
