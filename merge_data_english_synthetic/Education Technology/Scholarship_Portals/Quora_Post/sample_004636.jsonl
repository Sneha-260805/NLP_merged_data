{"unnormalised": "As someone deeply involved in education technology in India, I’ve seen the proliferation of scholarship portals offering assistance to students pursuing higher education. Are they truly effective, and what are the key considerations?", "normalised": "On the positive side, these platforms provide a centralized location for students to discover numerous scholarships, saving them considerable time and effort compared to scouring individual university websites or government notifications. Think of it like a delicious plate of biryani – a diverse mix of opportunities, easily accessible. Many portals also offer application assistance, essay writing tips, and even connect students with mentors.
