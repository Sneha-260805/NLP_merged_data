Adaptive learning platforms use technology to understand your individual strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and pace. So, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach like in many schools even in metros like Mumbai or Delhi, it tailors the content and difficulty to *you*.", "normalised": "Think of it as a personal tutor, but a super-smart, algorithm-powered one.

Instead of just moving on to the next chapter (pressure, right?), an adaptive learning system identifies this and gives you extra practice problems, explains the concept in a different way, or even breaks it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Conversely, if you’re already acing geometry, it'll skip the basics and jump straight to more challenging stuff. Efficiency, folks!", "normalised": "Imagine, you're struggling with a particular physics concept in class tenth.
