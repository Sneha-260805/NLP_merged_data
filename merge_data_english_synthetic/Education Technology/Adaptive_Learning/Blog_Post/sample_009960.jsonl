{"unnormalised": "Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms (don't be scared!) to figure out where you're strong and where you need a little extra help. Let's say you're struggling with fractions. The system will notice this and automatically offer you extra practice problems, maybe even a video explaining the concept in a different way. But if you’re breezing through algebra, it will serve you up some challenging applications to keep you engaged.", "normalised": "Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms (don't be scared!) to figure out where you are strong and where you need a little extra help.

Adaptive learning offers a more efficient, personalized, and frankly, less stressful path to knowledge. It’s not a magic bullet, but it’s a seriously powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn. What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments! And happy learning, folks! Maybe next time, we'll talk about AI in education.", "normalised": "During festival times like Onam, instead of cramming for exams, students can enjoy the celebrations knowing their learning is focused and efficient.
