{"unnormalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's existing knowledge, identify learning gaps, and then tailor the curriculum and pace accordingly. Think of it as having a dedicated tutor who understands exactly where you’re struggling and provides targeted support. Imagine little Rohan in a Mumbai school benefiting from lessons that adapt in real-time to his pace, ensuring he fully grasps concepts before moving on. This is the promise of adaptive learning.", "normalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's existing knowledge, identify learning gaps, and then tailor the curriculum and pace accordingly.

{"unnormalised": "The potential benefits are significant. Improved learning outcomes, increased student engagement, and reduced learning time are just a few. For instance, think about learning Hindi. With adaptive learning, students from different states, like Tamil Nadu, can focus on vocabulary and grammar specific to their needs, instead of a generic curriculum. This is far more efficient.", "normalised": "The potential benefits are significant. Improved learning outcomes, increased student engagement, and reduced learning time are just a few.
