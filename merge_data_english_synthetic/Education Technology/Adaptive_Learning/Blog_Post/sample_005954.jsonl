{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analysis to adjust the learning path based on a student's performance in real-time. Imagine a student, Priya from IIT Delhi, struggling with a particular concept in Calculus. Instead of forcing her to continue with advanced topics, the AL system identifies her weak areas and provides focused practice questions and targeted tutorials until she grasps the fundamentals. This prevents frustration and builds a stronger foundation.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analysis to adjust the learning path based on a student's performance in real-time.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of AL are numerous. Students learn at their own pace, fostering a deeper understanding of the material. It also provides teachers with valuable insights into student performance, enabling them to provide more personalized support and interventions.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of AL in Indian schools and colleges faces challenges, including access to technology and teacher training. However, organizations like the National Digital Library of India are actively working to bridge the digital divide and promote the adoption of innovative EdTech solutions. Furthermore, as we approach Onam, a time of learning and celebration in Kerala, let us embrace the potential of Adaptive Learning to revolutionize education and empower students across the nation, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential. With continued investment and careful implementation, Adaptive Learning can truly transform the Indian education system, making it more equitable and effective for all.", "normalised": "The implementation of A L in Indian schools and colleges faces challenges, including access to technology and teacher training.
