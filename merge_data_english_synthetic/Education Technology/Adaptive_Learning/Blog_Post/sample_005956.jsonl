{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's understanding of a subject. Think of it like this: young Rohan struggling with algebra in his Class 8 CBSE syllabus. Instead of moving on at a pre-determined pace, the platform identifies Rohan’s weak areas – perhaps linear equations – and provides him with targeted practice problems and explanations until he demonstrates mastery. Only then does the system move him forward.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's understanding of a subject.

{"unnormalised": "The beauty of adaptive learning lies in its flexibility. For instance, Priya, excelling in her engineering entrance exam prep, can skip ahead in areas she already understands well, focusing her time and energy on more challenging concepts. This prevents boredom and maximizes learning efficiency. Leading institutions like IIT Delhi are exploring the potential of incorporating adaptive learning modules into their undergraduate programs.", "normalised": "The beauty of adaptive learning lies in its flexibility.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond individualized pace, adaptive learning can also customize the learning style. Some students learn best through visual aids, others through hands-on activities. The platform can adapt the delivery method accordingly. In India, with its diverse student population and varied learning styles, this personalized approach is particularly valuable.", "normalised": "Beyond individualized pace, adaptive learning can also customize the learning style.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning provides valuable data insights for educators. Teachers can track student progress, identify areas where the class as a whole is struggling, and adjust their teaching strategies accordingly. It's like having a detailed report card for the entire learning process, allowing educators to refine their methods continuously.", "normalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning provides valuable data insights for educators.

{"unnormalised": "While adaptive learning is still evolving, its potential to revolutionize education in India is immense. From helping students master complex subjects to providing teachers with valuable data, this technology promises to create a more engaging and effective learning experience for all. Just like savouring a well-made biryani, perfectly spiced and cooked to individual preference, adaptive learning aims to deliver an educational experience tailored for each student, promoting deep understanding and lifelong learning.", "normalised": "While adaptive learning is still evolving, its potential to revolutionize education in India is immense.
