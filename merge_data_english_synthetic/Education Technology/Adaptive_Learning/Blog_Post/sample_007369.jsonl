{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: traditionally, everyone in class gets the same textbook, the same lectures, regardless of whether Rohan already aced trigonometry or if Priya needs a bit more help understanding basic algebra. Adaptive learning, on the other hand, is like having a personal tutor for every student. It uses algorithms and data to understand each student's strengths and weaknesses and then tailors the learning experience accordingly.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: traditionally, everyone in class gets the same textbook, the same lectures, regardless of whether Rohan already aced trigonometry or if Priya needs a bit more help understanding basic algebra.

Instead of moving on to the next chapter on thermodynamics, it serves up targeted lessons, practice questions, and maybe even a fun animation explaining reaction mechanisms.
