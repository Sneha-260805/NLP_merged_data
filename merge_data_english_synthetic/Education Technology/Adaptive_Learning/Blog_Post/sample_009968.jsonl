Instead of just slogging through every chapter, the platform pinpoints your weak areas (like, maybe you keep messing up those tricky organic chemistry reactions!) and gives you extra practice, video tutorials, and even personalized quizzes focusing *just* on that.

Think of it like this: instead of every kid in Class 5th having to learn the same math problems at the same pace, the platform adjusts the difficulty based on their individual understanding. Maybe little Rohan is already acing multiplication and needs a challenge, while Lakshmi needs a bit more help with subtraction.

But overall, I'm super excited about the potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education in India. It's like getting a personal tutor, but at scale!
