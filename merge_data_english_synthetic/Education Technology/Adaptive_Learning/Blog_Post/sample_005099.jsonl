But with adaptive learning? The platform *figures out* that you're weak in complex numbers and throws you extra practice problems, specifically tailored to that area. If you nail those, it moves you on to something more challenging.", "normalised": "Imagine this: You're preparing for the I I T-J E E exam, and struggling with complex numbers.

Basically, the platform tracks everything you do – how long you spend on a question, whether you get it right or wrong, and what kinds of mistakes you make. This data is then used to create a personalized learning path for you. It's not a one-size-fits-all approach like the classes we remember from school, where everyone had to learn at the same pace, regardless of their understanding.", "normalised": "So, how does it actually work?
