{"unnormalised": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Education Technology, adaptive learning is emerging as a powerful tool to personalize the learning experience for students. Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches, adaptive learning systems leverage algorithms and data analytics to tailor content and pace based on an individual's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. Think of it as having a customized tutor for every student, guiding them through the curriculum at their own speed.", "normalised": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Education Technology, adaptive learning is emerging as a powerful tool to personalize the learning experience for students.

If a student consistently struggles with a concept, the system will automatically provide remedial material or offer a different explanation. Conversely, if a student masters a topic quickly, the system will advance them to more challenging content. This ensures that students are always engaged at an appropriate level, avoiding frustration and maximizing their learning potential.", "normalised": "The technology works by continuously assessing a student's performance.
