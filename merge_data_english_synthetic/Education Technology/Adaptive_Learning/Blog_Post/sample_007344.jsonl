{"unnormalised": "Basically, Adaptive Learning uses technology to tailor the learning experience to each individual student. Think of it like this: instead of everyone getting the same plate of biryani (which, don't get me wrong, is amazing!), Adaptive Learning serves up a customized meal based on your preferences and dietary needs. If you're struggling with trigonometry, the system throws more questions your way to solidify your understanding. Nail it? Great! It moves on to something more challenging.", "normalised": "Basically, Adaptive Learning uses technology to tailor the learning experience to each individual student.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: learning tailored to your speed, your strengths, and your weaknesses. It's like having a personal tutor available 24/7.
