{"unnormalised": "Basically, adaptive learning is like having a super-smart tutor that customizes the learning experience just for you. Forget those one-size-fits-all textbooks! The software figures out your strengths and weaknesses – maybe you ace algebra but struggle with geometry, right? – and then adjusts the difficulty and pace accordingly. It's like magic, but with algorithms!", "normalised": "Basically, adaptive learning is like having a super-smart tutor that customizes the learning experience just for you.

Instead of slogging through everything, adaptive learning can pinpoint the topics where you need the most help, saving you time and frustration. It can even provide different learning resources, like videos or practice problems, based on how *you* learn best. Pretty cool, huh?", "normalised": "Think about prepping for the I I T-J E E.

It might not be a complete replacement for traditional teaching methods, but it's definitely a promising tool that can enhance the learning experience. What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments! Rs. 5000/- spent on it can save a year perhaps! They say it improved their scores by 15 km/hr! Let me know if you have had some experience using this.", "normalised": "Institutions like the Narayana Group and F I I T J E E are also exploring these technologies.
