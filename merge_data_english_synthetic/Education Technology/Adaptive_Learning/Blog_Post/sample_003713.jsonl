{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning, at its core, uses technology to tailor the learning content and pace to each individual student. Imagine a system that assesses Rohan's understanding of, say, algebraic equations. If he struggles with solving linear equations, the system will provide him with additional practice problems, explanations, and even video tutorials. Conversely, if Priya excels in geometry, the system will accelerate her progress, offering more challenging content and opportunities for advanced exploration.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning, at its core, uses technology to tailor the learning content and pace to each individual student.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are manifold. Adaptive learning can improve student engagement, increase knowledge retention, and reduce learning time. It also provides valuable data insights for teachers, allowing them to identify learning gaps and provide targeted support to students who need it most. It's particularly useful for bridging the learning gaps that often become apparent after festival breaks like Onam, when students may need a refresher to get back on track.", "normalised": "The benefits are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "However, successful implementation requires careful consideration. The technology must be robust, the content must be high-quality, and teachers must be trained to effectively utilize the data and insights provided by the adaptive learning system. Furthermore, accessibility for students in rural areas with limited internet connectivity is a crucial factor to address.", "normalised": "However, successful implementation requires careful consideration.
