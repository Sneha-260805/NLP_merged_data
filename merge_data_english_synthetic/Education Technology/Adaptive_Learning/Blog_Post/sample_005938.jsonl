{"unnormalised": "Traditional education often follows a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving some students struggling to keep up while others remain unchallenged. Adaptive learning platforms, on the other hand, use algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's understanding in real-time. Based on this assessment, the system adjusts the difficulty level, content, and even the pacing of the learning materials. Think of it like a bespoke suit crafted perfectly for each individual student, rather than a standard size.", "normalised": "Traditional education often follows a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving some students struggling to keep up while others remain unchallenged.

{"unnormalised": "Consider a student in Chennai struggling with fractions. An adaptive learning system can identify this gap and provide targeted practice problems and resources, perhaps even using visual aids involving dividing a delicious plate of biryani. Once the student demonstrates mastery, the system progresses to more challenging concepts. Meanwhile, a student in Delhi excelling in algebra can immediately move on to pre-calculus without unnecessary repetition.", "normalised": "Consider a student in Chennai struggling with fractions.

{"unnormalised": "This festive season of Onam, let us embrace the spirit of innovation and consider how adaptive learning can transform the educational landscape in India, making quality education accessible to all, regardless of their location or background. It's about creating a more equitable and effective system, one student at a time. Implementing Adaptive Learning will require significant Rs. and infrastructure upgrades. But the investment is essential for a brighter future. It can increase learning speeds by upto 20%. We need 5000 trained experts on Adaptive Learning to implement it correctly.", "normalised": "This festive season of Onam, let us embrace the spirit of innovation and consider how adaptive learning can transform the educational landscape in India, making quality education accessible to all, regardless of their location or background.
