{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: your teacher is Chintu, a super-smart AI that personalizes your learning journey. If you’re struggling with fractions, Chintu will provide extra practice, maybe even break it down with relatable examples – like dividing a plate of delicious biryani amongst friends! If you’re breezing through, Chintu throws you a curveball, challenging you with harder problems.

Instead of just grinding through countless practice papers, an adaptive learning system could pinpoint exactly which concepts (like, say, thermodynamics or organic chemistry) they're struggling with and offer targeted support.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Access to technology is still a barrier for many, especially in rural areas. And there's the question of data privacy and ethical considerations. But the potential benefits are undeniable. Think of a future where every student, regardless of their background or learning style, gets the personalized education they deserve. Now *that’s* something worth celebrating, maybe with a big Onam sadhya! What do you think? Let me know in the comments! We also need better infrastructure like more bandwidth availability (at least 20 Mbps) in tier 2 & 3 cities.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.
