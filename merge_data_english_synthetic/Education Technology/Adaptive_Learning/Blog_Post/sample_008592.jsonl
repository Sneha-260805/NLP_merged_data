With adaptive learning software, Priya would be presented with problems geared towards her current understanding. If she answers correctly, the system automatically increases the difficulty, pushing her to learn more. However, if she falters, the system identifies the specific areas of weakness and provides targeted remediation – perhaps a helpful video explanation or a set of easier practice problems.", "normalised": "Imagine a young student, Priya from Delhi, struggling with fractions in her mathematics class.
