Adaptive learning platforms basically figure out what you already know, what you struggle with, and then adjust the pace and content to fit you perfectly. Think personalized biryani, where they know you like extra spice and less rice - exactly what you need!", "normalised": "Imagine learning isn't just a one-size-fits-all thing anymore.
