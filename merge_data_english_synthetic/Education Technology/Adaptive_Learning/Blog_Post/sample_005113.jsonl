It's like having a super-smart tutor who *actually* understands what you need.", "normalised": "Hey guys, ever feel like school lessons are sometimes too easy and sometimes, well, totally beyond your head?

{"unnormalised": "Think of it as customized learning, but amped up with technology. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to figure out your strengths and weaknesses. So, if Priya from Bangalore is acing algebra but struggling with geometry, the system will focus more on geometry problems for her. Pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Think of it as customized learning, but amped up with technology.

It frees them up to work with individuals who need extra support, rather than trying to teach to the \"average\" student.

{"unnormalised": "It definitely sounds promising, and the potential for personalised learning is huge. What do you think? Could adaptive learning be the key to unlocking better educational outcomes for students all over India? Let's discuss this while enjoying a plate of spicy Hyderabadi biryani this Diwali! This seems to be a much better method, and saves Rs. 10,000 annually on tuition. It's like having a tutor that is 20 km away, right in your house!", "normalised": "It definitely sounds promising, and the potential for personalised learning is huge. What do you think?
