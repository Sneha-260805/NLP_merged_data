{"unnormalised": "Education technology is rapidly transforming how we approach learning in India, and at the forefront of this revolution is adaptive learning. Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all instruction, adaptive learning platforms tailor educational content and pace to individual student needs. Imagine a student in a remote village in Rajasthan accessing the same quality of education as someone in a bustling city like Mumbai, all personalized to their current skill level. That's the power of adaptive learning.", "normalised": "Education technology is rapidly transforming how we approach learning in India, and at the forefront of this revolution is adaptive learning.

{"unnormalised": "These platforms use sophisticated algorithms to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas where they excel and where they need additional support. For example, a student struggling with trigonometry might receive extra practice problems and simplified explanations, while a student who grasps the concepts quickly can move on to more challenging material. This personalized approach can significantly improve learning outcomes and student engagement.", "normalised": "These platforms use sophisticated algorithms to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas where they excel and where they need additional support.
