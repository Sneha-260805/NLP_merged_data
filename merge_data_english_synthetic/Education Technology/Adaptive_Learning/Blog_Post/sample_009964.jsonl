{"unnormalised": "So, how does it work? Basically, these platforms use algorithms to assess a student’s knowledge and understanding. For instance, imagine little Rohan struggling with trigonometry in his Class 10 Maths class. An adaptive learning system would identify his weak areas – maybe he’s having trouble with sin and cos. – and then provide him with targeted exercises and resources to build his skills. If he aces those, the system moves him on to more challenging problems. If he’s still struggling, it offers simpler explanations or even reviews previous concepts.", "normalised": "So, how does it work?

This means students can learn at their own pace, and teachers can focus their attention on students who need more individualized support.", "normalised": "One example is the Mindspark platform, which many Indian schools are exploring.

But the potential is huge. Just imagine a future where every student in a village near Madurai has access to personalized learning tailored to their specific needs and learning style. Now, that’s something worth celebrating, maybe with some Onam sadhya! What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments!", "normalised": "It is not perfect, of course.
