Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all methods, adaptive learning uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to tailor the learning experience to each individual student. Think of it as having a personal tutor, available 24/7, who understands your strengths and weaknesses better than even your parents sometimes!", "normalised": "education technology is rapidly evolving and one of the most promising advancements is adaptive learning unlike traditional one size fits all methods adaptive learning uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to tailor the learning experience to each individual student think of it as having a personal tutor available twenty four seven who understands your strengths and weaknesses better than even your parents sometimes"}

Imagine a student in a small village in Rajasthan being able to access the same quality education as someone in a top-tier school in Mumbai, all thanks to a platform that adjusts to their pace and learning style.", "normalised": "in india where we have such diverse learning needs and access to resources adaptive learning holds immense potential imagine a student in a small village in rajasthan being able to access the same quality education as someone in a top tier school in mumbai all thanks to a platform that adjusts to their pace and learning style"}
{"unnormalised": "How does it work? Adaptive learning platforms typically use a variety of assessments to determine a student's baseline knowledge. Based on this, they present content and activities that are appropriately challenging. If a student struggles with a concept, the system provides additional support, perhaps in the form of simplified explanations or practice problems. If they excel, they can move on to more advanced material, preventing boredom and keeping them engaged. It's like the perfect plate of biryani – just the right amount of spice (challenge) to keep you coming back for more.", "normalised": "how does it work adaptive learning platforms typically use a variety of assessments to determine a student's baseline knowledge based on this they present content and activities that are appropriately challenging if a student struggles with a concept the system provides additional support perhaps in the form of simplified explanations or practice problems if they excel they can move on to more advanced material preventing boredom and keeping them engaged it's like the perfect plate of biryani just the right amount of spice challenge to keep you coming back for more"}
