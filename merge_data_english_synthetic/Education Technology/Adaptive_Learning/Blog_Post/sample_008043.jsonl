{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyze a student's performance in real-time. Imagine a student, Priya from Delhi Public School, struggling with a concept in algebra. The system immediately identifies the gap and provides targeted interventions, perhaps through simpler explanations, practice problems, or even a video tutorial explaining the specific concept. Conversely, for Rohan from IIT Bombay, who grasps the material quickly, the system offers more challenging content to keep him engaged and push his boundaries.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyze a student's performance in real-time.

{"unnormalised": "This personalized approach offers several key benefits. Firstly, it improves student engagement by providing content tailored to their skill level and learning style. Secondly, it enhances knowledge retention by reinforcing concepts that students find challenging. Finally, it allows educators to identify learning gaps early on and provide timely support. Think of it as a highly effective tutor, available 24/7, monitoring progress and adjusting the learning path as needed.", "normalised": "This personalized approach offers several key benefits.

{"unnormalised": "Several institutions in India are already experimenting with adaptive learning platforms. Manipal University, for instance, has implemented adaptive learning tools in its engineering programs, showing promising results in student outcomes. The implementation started around 10/10/2023 and the initial feedback is encouraging. Even government initiatives like the National Education Policy 2020 recognize the importance of technology-enabled learning, potentially paving the way for wider adoption of adaptive learning solutions. A review meeting regarding this is scheduled for 14/11/2024 at 15:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Several institutions in India are already experimenting with adaptive learning platforms.
