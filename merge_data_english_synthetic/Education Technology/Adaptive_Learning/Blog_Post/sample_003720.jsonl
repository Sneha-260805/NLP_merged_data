{"unnormalised": "In today's fast-paced world, the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to education is becoming increasingly obsolete. Enter adaptive learning, a powerful tool within education technology that personalizes the learning experience for each individual student. Imagine a classroom where every student, from Rohan in Delhi to Priya in Chennai, is learning at their own pace, focusing on areas where they need the most help. That's the promise of adaptive learning.", "normalised": "In today's fast-paced world, the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to education is becoming increasingly obsolete.

{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and data analysis to identify a student's strengths and weaknesses. Based on this assessment, the system adjusts the difficulty level, content, and even the learning style to match the student's needs. For instance, if a student is struggling with a concept in algebra, the system might provide more foundational exercises or present the information in a different format, perhaps through a visual aid or a game. It's like having a personal tutor, but available 24/7.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and data analysis to identify a student's strengths and weaknesses.

An adaptive \"biryani-making\" guide would adjust the recipe based on your previous attempts and feedback, ensuring the perfect dish every time. Similarly, adaptive learning continuously monitors a student's progress and adjusts the learning path accordingly.", "normalised": "Think of it like preparing biryani during Onam.

{"unnormalised": "This technology holds immense potential for Indian schools and universities, like IIT Bombay or JNU. It can help bridge learning gaps, improve student engagement, and ultimately lead to better academic outcomes. By tailoring the learning experience to individual needs, adaptive learning ensures that every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Investing in such technologies is crucial for India to become a global leader in education and innovation. The cost per student for these systems is decreasing, making it more accessible for even rural schools across 20,000 villages. Rs. 500 per student per year could provide access.", "normalised": "This technology holds immense potential for Indian schools and universities, like I I T Bombay or J N U.
