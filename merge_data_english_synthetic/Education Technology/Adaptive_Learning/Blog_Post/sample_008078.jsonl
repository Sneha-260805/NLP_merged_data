If he excels in algebra, the system moves him forward at a faster rate. However, if he struggles with calculus, the platform provides him with more targeted practice questions, supplementary resources, and even revisits fundamental concepts. This is far more effective than simply churning through a standardized syllabus.", "normalised": "Imagine a student like Rohan from Chennai preparing for his I I T-J E E exams.

Perhaps by 2030, adaptive learning will be the norm rather than the exception in Indian education. Implementing this before the Independence Day celebrations on 15/08 will be a proud moment. The cost? Significantly lower than traditional tutoring options, making quality education accessible to a wider segment of the population in Bharat.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the potential of adaptive learning is immense.
