{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analysis to assess a student's current knowledge level and identify areas where they need further support. Think of it as a personalized tutor available 24/7, adjusting the difficulty of questions and content based on the student's performance in real-time. If Priya from Delhi struggles with fractions, the platform will provide her with additional practice and explanations before moving on to more complex concepts.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analysis to assess a student's current knowledge level and identify areas where they need further support.

{"unnormalised": "This contrasts sharply with traditional classroom settings where teachers, often burdened with large class sizes of 40+ students, find it challenging to cater to individual needs. Adaptive learning platforms can help bridge this gap, allowing teachers to focus on providing individualized support and fostering deeper understanding. Imagine a teacher using data from an adaptive learning program to identify common misconceptions among students and then tailoring their lesson plans accordingly.", "normalised": "This contrasts sharply with traditional classroom settings where teachers, often burdened with large class sizes of forty plus students, find it challenging to cater to individual needs.

Students like Karthik, preparing for the IIT entrance exams, can use adaptive learning to identify their weak areas in physics and focus their efforts effectively. Even students in remote areas like villages in Rajasthan, with limited access to quality teachers, can benefit from personalized instruction via online adaptive learning platforms.", "normalised": "The benefits are numerous: improved engagement, faster learning rates, and increased confidence.

{"unnormalised": "Implementing adaptive learning solutions requires investment in infrastructure and teacher training. Institutions like IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad are already incorporating elements of adaptive learning into their curricula, paving the way for widespread adoption. The challenge now is to make these technologies accessible and affordable to all students, regardless of their socio-economic background.", "normalised": "Implementing adaptive learning solutions requires investment in infrastructure and teacher training.
