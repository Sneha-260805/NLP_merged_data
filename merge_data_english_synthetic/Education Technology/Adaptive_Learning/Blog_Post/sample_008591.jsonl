With adaptive learning software, Priya's learning journey becomes personalized. The system assesses her understanding, identifies knowledge gaps, and then presents her with targeted lessons and practice problems focusing specifically on areas where she needs improvement. Maybe it will show her a worked example of a similar problem set in the context of calculating the area needed to make dosas for an Onam celebration.", "normalised": "Imagine a student like Priya from Chennai struggling with quadratic equations in her Class ten Math class.

{"unnormalised": "Consider the Vidya Bharati schools across India. Implementing adaptive learning solutions there could significantly improve student outcomes, especially in subjects like Science and Mathematics. By catering to diverse learning styles and paces, these technologies can help bridge the achievement gap and empower all students to reach their full potential. The Rs. 20,000 investment in a yearly subscription for a student may seem significant initially, but the return in terms of improved grades and increased confidence is immeasurable. Just as a perfect biryani requires a blend of precise ingredients, adaptive learning requires a tailored approach to each learner's unique needs. This represents a significant leap forward in EdTech, promising a more effective and equitable future for education.", "normalised": "Consider the Vidya Bharati schools across India.
