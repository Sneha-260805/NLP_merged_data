{"unnormalised": "Traditional classroom settings often follow a one-size-fits-all model, which can leave some students struggling to keep up while others may feel unchallenged. Adaptive learning platforms, however, analyze student performance in real-time and adjust the difficulty and content accordingly. If a student from, say, a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Delhi struggles with a concept in Algebra, the system might provide additional examples, break down the problem into smaller steps, or even offer alternative explanations. Conversely, if a student like Priya from IIT Bombay demonstrates mastery quickly, the platform can accelerate their learning path and introduce more complex topics.", "normalised": "Traditional classroom settings often follow a one-size-fits-all model, which can leave some students struggling to keep up while others may feel unchallenged.

{"unnormalised": "While challenges remain, such as the need for robust data security measures and equitable access to technology, the potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education is undeniable. Perhaps by 2047, the centenary year of India's independence (15/08/1947), adaptive learning will be the norm rather than the exception. Training programs for teachers need to be in place by 01/01/2025 to embrace and effectively use these technologies. The goal is to empower every student to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or learning style.", "normalised": "While challenges remain, such as the need for robust data security measures and equitable access to technology, the potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education is undeniable.
