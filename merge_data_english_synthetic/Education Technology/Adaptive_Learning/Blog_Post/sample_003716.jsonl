{"unnormalised": "At its core, adaptive learning utilizes technology to assess a student's understanding of a subject and then adjusts the difficulty and pace of the learning material accordingly. Forget the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Think personalized learning pathways, similar to navigating the diverse flavors of a grand Onam Sadhya, where each dish caters to a different palate.", "normalised": "At its core, adaptive learning utilizes technology to assess a student's understanding of a subject and then adjusts the difficulty and pace of the learning material accordingly.

{"unnormalised": "How does it work? Adaptive learning platforms often employ algorithms that analyze student performance on various tasks. If a student consistently struggles with a concept, the system provides additional support, such as supplementary materials, simpler explanations, or more practice questions. Conversely, if a student demonstrates mastery, the system accelerates their progress, introducing more challenging concepts and assignments.", "normalised": "How does it work?

{"unnormalised": "For example, consider a student learning mathematics. An adaptive platform might identify that they are struggling with algebra but excel in geometry. The platform would then dedicate more time to algebra, providing personalized tutorials and practice problems until the student demonstrates proficiency. This targeted approach ensures that students aren't left behind or held back, maximizing their learning potential.", "normalised": "For example, consider a student learning mathematics.
