So, I was chatting with my cousin Priya from IIT Madras the other day, and she was going on and on about this thing called \"adaptive learning.\" At first, I was like, \"Yeah, yeah, more edtech jargon.\" But the more she explained, the more I realized this is actually *pretty cool*.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, like those old NCERT textbooks we all suffered through, adaptive learning uses algorithms to personalize your learning journey.", "normalised": "Imagine a tutor that *knows* exactly what you're struggling with and adjusts the lessons accordingly.

With adaptive learning, Rohan gets more practice problems on algebra, and Meena gets more geometry. No time wasted on stuff they already know! It's like having your own personal Dronacharya guiding you to perfection.", "normalised": "Think about it: Rohan might breeze through fractions but needs help with algebra.
