Like trying to eat biryani with a spoon when everyone else has a fork (or in some cases, their hands – no judgment! 😉)? That's where adaptive learning comes in, folks.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: Instead of one-size-fits-all lectures, adaptive learning platforms adjust the difficulty and content based on YOUR individual understanding. Struggling with that tricky physics concept? The platform might offer simpler explanations, more practice problems, or even link you to a helpful Khan Academy video. Breezing through everything? Awesome! It’ll serve up more challenging material to keep you engaged and learning at a faster pace.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: Instead of one-size-fits-all lectures, adaptive learning platforms adjust the difficulty and content based on YOUR individual understanding.

It’s like having a personal tutor available 24/7, guiding you through the material and making sure you actually *understand* it, rather than just memorizing facts for the exam. Imagine nailing that JEE entrance exam because of a personalized learning experience!", "normalised": "So, how does it work?
