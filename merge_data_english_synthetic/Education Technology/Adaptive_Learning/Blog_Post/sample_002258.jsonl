{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning, a revolutionary concept in education technology, is rapidly gaining traction across India. It promises to tailor educational content and pace to each student’s individual needs, strengths, and weaknesses. Imagine a system that understands whether Rohan from Delhi struggles with algebraic equations or if Priya from Chennai excels at organic chemistry and adjusts the curriculum accordingly. This is the power of adaptive learning.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning, a revolutionary concept in education technology, is rapidly gaining traction across India.

{"unnormalised": "Unlike traditional “one-size-fits-all” approaches, adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's understanding in real-time. This allows the system to provide targeted interventions and personalized learning pathways. For instance, if a student falters on a particular concept in a chapter, the system might offer additional practice problems, video explanations, or even connect them with a virtual tutor. Conversely, a student demonstrating mastery can move ahead quickly, avoiding unnecessary repetition. Think of it as a personalized coaching system, available 24/7.", "normalised": "Unlike traditional “one size fits all” approaches, adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's understanding in real time.

{"unnormalised": "Many institutions, including IIT Bombay, are exploring the integration of adaptive learning tools in their existing curricula. The potential benefits are significant: improved student engagement, increased knowledge retention, and ultimately, better learning outcomes. Consider preparing for competitive exams like JEE. An adaptive learning platform can pinpoint the exact areas where a student needs to focus, maximizing their study time and increasing their chances of success.", "normalised": "Many institutions, including I I T Bombay, are exploring the integration of adaptive learning tools in their existing curricula.

Ensuring equitable access to technology, developing high-quality adaptive content in regional languages, and addressing concerns about data privacy are crucial considerations. A successful implementation requires careful planning, robust infrastructure, and ongoing teacher training.", "normalised": "However, the implementation of adaptive learning also presents challenges.
