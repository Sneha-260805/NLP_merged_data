{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms leverage algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's understanding of a subject. Based on their performance, the system adjusts the difficulty level, content, and even the learning style presented. For example, if Lakshmi from IIT Kanpur struggles with a particular concept in calculus, the platform might provide additional examples, videos, or even simpler, foundational exercises before moving on. Conversely, if Arjun breezes through a module on Indian History, the system will immediately challenge him with more complex material.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms leverage algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's understanding of a subject.

{"unnormalised": "This personalized approach contrasts sharply with traditional, one-size-fits-all teaching methods, often leading to improved learning outcomes. Students are more engaged and motivated when they are working at their optimal level of challenge. They don't get bored because the material is too easy, nor do they become discouraged by content that is too difficult.", "normalised": "This personalized approach contrasts sharply with traditional, one-size-fits-all teaching methods, often leading to improved learning outcomes.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of adaptive learning in Indian schools and universities is steadily increasing. Many institutions are experimenting with platforms like Cuemath or Byju's to supplement traditional classroom instruction, particularly in subjects like mathematics and science.

{"unnormalised": "While the technology is promising, it’s essential to remember that adaptive learning is just one piece of the puzzle. The role of the teacher remains paramount in guiding and mentoring students. Consider a pilot program starting 01/01/2024 at 09:00 hrs, focusing on integrated adaptive learning into the curriculum. Ultimately, successful implementation depends on thoughtful integration and a focus on the holistic development of each student. This also relates to budgetary allocations, specifically the R&D spend as of 14/11/2023.", "normalised": "While the technology is promising, it's essential to remember that adaptive learning is just one piece of the puzzle.
