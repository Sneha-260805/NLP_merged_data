With adaptive learning platforms, Priya wouldn't be forced to keep pace with the rest of her class if she hasn't grasped the fundamental concepts. Instead, the system identifies her knowledge gaps and provides targeted practice problems and tutorials specifically designed to address those areas. As she progresses, the difficulty level adapts automatically, ensuring she's constantly challenged but not overwhelmed.", "normalised": "Imagine a student, Priya from Chennai, struggling with quadratic equations.
