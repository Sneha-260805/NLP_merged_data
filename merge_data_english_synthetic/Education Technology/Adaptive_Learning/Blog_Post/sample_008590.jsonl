Instead of being left behind, an adaptive learning platform would identify her specific knowledge gaps – perhaps understanding of numerators vs. denominators – and provide targeted exercises and explanations. Simultaneously, Rohan from Chennai, already proficient in fractions, would be presented with more challenging problems to keep him engaged and motivated.", "normalised": "Imagine a student, Priya from Delhi, struggling with fractions in her eighth grade math class.
