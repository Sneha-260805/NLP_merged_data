{"unnormalised": "Imagine a student, perhaps a young Rohan from Delhi, struggling with a particular concept in algebra. Instead of pushing him forward with the rest of the class, an adaptive learning system identifies his weakness and provides targeted exercises and resources to reinforce his understanding. Conversely, a student like Priya from Chennai who grasps calculus quickly can be offered more challenging material to keep her engaged and stimulated. This personalized approach keeps every student at their \"zone of proximal development,\" a sweet spot where learning is challenging yet attainable.", "normalised": "Imagine a student, perhaps a young Rohan from Delhi, struggling with a particular concept in algebra.

Teachers can identify common areas of difficulty and adjust their teaching strategies accordingly. Think of Ms. Sharma in Jaipur being able to see, on 26/01/2024, that a large number of her students are struggling with trigonometry, allowing her to dedicate more class time to that topic. This data-driven approach empowers educators to make informed decisions and tailor their instruction to meet the specific needs of their students.", "normalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning systems can provide teachers with valuable data insights into student performance.

Moreover, ensuring that adaptive learning platforms are culturally relevant and aligned with the Indian curriculum is crucial. At 14:00 hrs on 15/08/2023, a panel discussion on \"EdTech for Bharat\" addressed these very concerns, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive and localized solutions.", "normalised": "However, implementation is not without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The future of education in India is undoubtedly intertwined with technology. Adaptive learning, with its potential to personalize learning and empower both students and teachers, is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping that future. By integrating AI-powered tools, and launching them possibly around Diwali (20/10/2024), we can ensure a brighter future for generations to come.", "normalised": "The future of education in India is undoubtedly intertwined with technology.
