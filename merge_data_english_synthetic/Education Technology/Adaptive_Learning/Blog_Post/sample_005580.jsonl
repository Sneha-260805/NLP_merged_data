{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning systems utilize sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to assess a student's current understanding of a subject. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all approaches, these systems constantly monitor progress and adjust the difficulty level, content, and even the learning style presented. For example, a student struggling with a geometry concept might receive additional practice problems and visualizations, while a student grasping the material quickly can move on to more challenging topics.", "normalised": "adaptive learning systems utilize sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to assess a student's current understanding of a subject. unlike traditional one-size-fits-all approaches, these systems constantly monitor progress and adjust the difficulty level, content, and even the learning style presented. for example, a student struggling with a geometry concept might receive additional practice problems and visualizations, while a student grasping the material quickly can move on to more challenging topics."}
{"unnormalised": "Think of it as a virtual tutor, meticulously crafting a personalized learning path. This is particularly crucial in a diverse country like India, where students come from varied educational backgrounds and have different learning paces. An adaptive learning platform could identify gaps in foundational knowledge for a student from a rural Rajasthan school and provide targeted remediation, ensuring they're not left behind.", "normalised": "think of it as a virtual tutor, meticulously crafting a personalized learning path. this is particularly crucial in a diverse country like india, where students come from varied educational backgrounds and have different learning paces. an adaptive learning platform could identify gaps in foundational knowledge for a student from a rural rajasthan school and provide targeted remediation, ensuring they're not left behind."}
{"unnormalised": "The benefits are numerous. Students experience increased engagement and motivation, as they are presented with material that is challenging but not overwhelming. This leads to improved understanding, retention, and ultimately, better academic outcomes. Adaptive learning also frees up teachers to focus on providing individual support and guidance, fostering a more collaborative and personalized learning environment. Many institutions, including IIT Delhi, are exploring incorporating adaptive learning into their curriculum, aiming for a more effective learning outcome for their students.", "normalised": "the benefits are numerous. students experience increased engagement and motivation, as they are presented with material that is challenging but not overwhelming. this leads to improved understanding, retention, and ultimately, better academic outcomes. adaptive learning also frees up teachers to focus on providing individual support and guidance, fostering a more collaborative and personalized learning environment. many institutions, including i i t delhi, are exploring incorporating adaptive learning into their curriculum, aiming for a more effective learning outcome for their students."}
{"unnormalised": "While widespread adoption requires investment in infrastructure and teacher training, the potential of adaptive learning to transform education in India is undeniable. Imagine a future where every child, regardless of their background, has access to a world-class education, customized to their unique learning needs. Let's work towards making this a reality, ensuring that India's future generation is well-equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. The deadline to submit a pilot proposal for implementing such a system is 31/12/2024. The initial meeting is scheduled for 10:00 hrs on 15/01/2025 and the expected rollout date is 01/07/2025.", "normalised": "while widespread adoption requires investment in infrastructure and teacher training, the potential of adaptive learning to transform education in india is undeniable. imagine a future where every child, regardless of their background, has access to a world-class education, customized to their unique learning needs. let's work towards making this a reality, ensuring that india's future generation is well-equipped to face the challenges of the twenty first century. the deadline to submit a pilot proposal for implementing such a system is thirty first december two thousand and twenty four. the initial meeting is scheduled for ten hours on fifteenth january two thousand and twenty five and the expected rollout date is first july two thousand and twenty five."}
