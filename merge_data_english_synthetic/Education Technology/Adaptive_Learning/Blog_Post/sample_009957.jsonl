{"unnormalised": "Basically, adaptive learning uses technology to tailor the learning experience to each student's individual needs. Think personalized learning paths, targeted content, and real-time feedback. Imagine a system that knows Priya struggles with fractions but aced the last geometry test. The system will then automatically adjust, giving Priya extra practice on fractions while letting her zoom ahead in geometry. Cool, right?", "normalised": "Basically, adaptive learning uses technology to tailor the learning experience to each student's individual needs.

{"unnormalised": "Forget those bulky textbooks and rote learning! With adaptive learning platforms, like some being developed at IIT Madras (heard they’re doing some killer work!), students learn at their own pace, focusing on areas where they need the most support. This means less time feeling lost and more time mastering the material. Plus, it frees up the teacher's time to provide individualized attention and guidance.", "normalised": "Forget those bulky textbooks and rote learning!

{"unnormalised": "Here’s the lowdown: Adaptive learning systems often use algorithms to analyze student performance and adjust the learning path accordingly. They might present different questions, offer additional resources, or even change the difficulty level based on the student's responses. This ensures that students are constantly challenged but never overwhelmed.", "normalised": "Here’s the lowdown: Adaptive learning systems often use algorithms to analyze student performance and adjust the learning path accordingly.

There's still a long way to go, especially in areas with limited internet access and fewer resources, but the potential is HUGE. Think about it: No more feeling left behind, just personalized education that helps every student reach their full potential. Now, that's something to celebrate with a plate of jalebi!", "normalised": "Some examples in India include platforms like Byju’s (yeah, they’re doing it!) and even some state government initiatives trying to implement adaptive learning in government schools in Rajasthan.
