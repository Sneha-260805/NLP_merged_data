Forget the 'one-size-fits-all' approach of traditional classrooms. With adaptive learning, a student struggling with trigonometry in their class 10th syllabus at DPS, R.K. Puram, will receive targeted lessons and practice problems focusing specifically on their areas of weakness.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analysis to assess a student's knowledge, identify gaps in understanding, and then provide customized content and activities.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are manifold. Students learn at their own pace, building a strong foundation before moving on to more complex concepts. This personalized approach fosters engagement and reduces frustration, especially vital for students preparing for competitive exams like JEE. Moreover, adaptive learning provides educators with valuable insights into student performance, allowing them to identify struggling learners early and intervene effectively. Think of it as a sophisticated diagnostic tool guiding teachers in their daily instruction.", "normalised": "The benefits are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "In India, where diverse learning styles and varying levels of access to quality education exist, adaptive learning holds immense potential. Initiatives are underway to integrate adaptive learning platforms in schools and coaching centers across the country. Consider the challenges of teaching a diverse class, with students from Mumbai to Guwahati. Adaptive learning can cater to this diversity and help improve overall educational outcomes.", "normalised": "In India, where diverse learning styles and varying levels of access to quality education exist, adaptive learning holds immense potential.

We need to ensure that technology is used to enhance, not replace, the human element of teaching. Just as savoring a perfectly cooked biryani involves a blend of ingredients and expertise, successful adaptive learning relies on a well-integrated ecosystem of technology, pedagogy, and human interaction. As we celebrate Onam, let us also celebrate the potential of adaptive learning to bring educational prosperity to all students across India. The cost of a good adaptive learning software can range from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000 per student per year, but the long-term benefits are immeasurable.", "normalised": "However, successful implementation requires careful consideration.
