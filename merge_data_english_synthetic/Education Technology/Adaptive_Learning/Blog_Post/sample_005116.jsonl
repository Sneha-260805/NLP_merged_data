{"unnormalised": "Think about it: remember those grueling math classes back in school? Some of us, like Priya, were whizzing through algebra while others, like yours truly, were still struggling with basic arithmetic. Adaptive learning platforms use AI to figure out exactly where you're at and adjust the difficulty accordingly. So, Priya gets challenged with more complex problems, and I get a little extra help on the fundamentals. No more cookie-cutter lessons!", "normalised": "Think about it: remember those grueling math classes back in school?
