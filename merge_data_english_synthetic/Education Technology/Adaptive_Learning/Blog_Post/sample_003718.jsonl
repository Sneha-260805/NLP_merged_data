The traditional classroom model, where the same lesson is delivered at the same pace to every student, often leaves some behind while boring others. Enter adaptive learning, a game-changing approach fueled by technology that promises to personalize education for each individual.", "normalised": "In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, one size definitely doesn't fit all.

{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyze a student's performance in real-time. Think of it like a personalized tutor, constantly assessing strengths and weaknesses. Based on this data, the platform adjusts the difficulty level, content, and even the presentation style to match the student's specific needs. For example, if Priya from Chennai is struggling with fractions, the system might offer her more practice problems and visual aids before moving on to more complex concepts. Meanwhile, Rohan from Delhi, who grasps fractions quickly, can progress to more challenging topics like algebra.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyze a student's performance in real-time.

It also allows them to learn at their own pace, ensuring a solid foundation before moving on to advanced material. Imagine a student preparing for JEE; an adaptive learning platform can pinpoint their weak areas in physics and chemistry, providing targeted practice and remediation, significantly increasing their chances of success.", "normalised": "This personalized approach offers several benefits.

Instead of relying solely on test scores, teachers can gain a deeper understanding of each student's learning journey. They can identify common misconceptions and tailor their instruction to address the specific needs of the class as a whole.", "normalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning provides valuable insights for teachers.

{"unnormalised": "While the implementation of adaptive learning requires careful planning and investment, the potential benefits are immense. Just as a delicious plate of biryani is customized with spices to individual preferences, adaptive learning customizes education to cater to the unique learning styles of each student. From the bustling classrooms of Mumbai to the serene schools of Kerala, adaptive learning has the power to transform education and empower every student to reach their full potential. Even during festival times like Onam, students can continue learning at their own pace, ensuring their education isn't disrupted. Investment of even Rs. 5000 per student, can lead to a jump of 20-30% in academic scores, as per a study by IIT Madras. This is a positive development for educational institutions such as BITS Pilani & IIM Ahmedabad. The future of education is personalized, adaptive, and accessible to all.", "normalised": "While the implementation of adaptive learning requires careful planning and investment, the potential benefits are immense.
