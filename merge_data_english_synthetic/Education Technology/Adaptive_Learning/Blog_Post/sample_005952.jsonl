With an adaptive learning platform, the system identifies her specific areas of weakness, perhaps fractions or linear equations. Instead of forcing her through a generic curriculum, the platform provides Priya with targeted exercises and explanations focused specifically on these areas. As she masters these concepts, the difficulty level gradually increases, ensuring she's constantly challenged but not overwhelmed.", "normalised": "Imagine a student, say Priya from Chennai, struggling with algebra.

{"unnormalised": "Several Indian EdTech companies are already incorporating adaptive learning principles into their platforms. Initiatives like providing customized learning modules for students preparing for JEE exams, or offering personalized language learning programs in Hindi and Bengali, are gaining traction. Imagine learning about the history of the Mughal empire with content that adapts to your understanding, showing images of the Taj Mahal if you are a visual learner or providing more textual details if you are a reader.", "normalised": "Several Indian E D Tech companies are already incorporating adaptive learning principles into their platforms.

{"unnormalised": "The potential benefits extend beyond academic performance. Adaptive learning can also foster greater student engagement and motivation. When students feel challenged but supported, they are more likely to remain invested in their learning journey. And as students advance, the system can introduce them to new topics, perhaps even recommending resources related to, say, the cultural significance of Onam in Kerala, or the regional variations of biryani across India.", "normalised": "The potential benefits extend beyond academic performance.
