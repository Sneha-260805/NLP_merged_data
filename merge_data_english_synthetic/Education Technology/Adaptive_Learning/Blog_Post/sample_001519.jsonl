Adaptive learning, on the other hand, watches you cook, sees you struggle with the rice-to-meat ratio, and then *adapts* to give you extra guidance on that specific area. Boom! Biryani perfection (eventually, at least!).", "normalised": "Think of it like this: you're trying to learn how to make the perfect Hyderabadi biryani.

{"unnormalised": "In education, adaptive learning uses algorithms and AI to tailor learning content to each student's individual needs. Imagine a kid at DPS, R.K. Puram learning Maths. Instead of everyone being forced through the same chapter on trigonometry at the same pace, the adaptive learning platform identifies that Priya understands sine and cosine brilliantly, but is struggling with tangent. It then presents her with more tangent-related problems and resources. Rohan, meanwhile, who's having trouble with sine, gets extra practice on *that* topic.", "normalised": "In education, adaptive learning uses algorithms and A I to tailor learning content to each student's individual needs.
