{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning, a key development in EdTech, promises a personalized and more effective learning experience for students across India. This innovative approach leverages technology to adjust the pace and content of instruction based on individual student needs and performance. Imagine a classroom where each student receives a tailored curriculum, addressing their specific learning gaps and fostering their strengths. That's the power of adaptive learning.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning, a key development in E D Tech, promises a personalized and more effective learning experience for students across India.

{"unnormalised": "Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all methods, adaptive learning platforms continuously assess a student's understanding through assessments and interactions. If a student struggles with a concept, say quadratic equations, the system provides additional resources, alternative explanations, and targeted practice problems, perhaps even incorporating visual aids familiar to a student from Kerala, drawing parallels to the geometric patterns in a pookalam during Onam. Conversely, if a student demonstrates mastery, the system progresses them to more challenging material, preventing boredom and fostering a deeper understanding.", "normalised": "Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all methods, adaptive learning platforms continuously assess a student's understanding through assessments and interactions.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are numerous. Adaptive learning helps students learn at their own pace, building confidence and reducing frustration. It also provides teachers with valuable data on student performance, allowing them to identify areas where students are struggling and provide targeted support.
