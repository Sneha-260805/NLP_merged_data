{"unnormalised": "Unlike the traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, adaptive learning platforms leverage algorithms and data analysis to understand a student's learning patterns. Consider little Rohan from Mumbai, struggling with algebra. An adaptive system would identify the specific areas he's finding difficult – perhaps solving linear equations – and provide him with targeted exercises and explanations. Meanwhile, Priya from Chennai, who excels in algebra, can move ahead to more challenging concepts, ensuring she remains engaged and motivated.", "normalised": "Unlike the traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, adaptive learning platforms leverage algorithms and data analysis to understand a student's learning patterns.

{"unnormalised": "These systems continuously monitor student performance, adjusting the difficulty level and content accordingly. If a student answers several questions correctly on a particular topic, the system will present more complex problems. Conversely, if a student is struggling, the system will provide simpler exercises and more detailed explanations. This ensures that students are always learning at their optimal pace, maximizing their comprehension and retention. This is a far cry from relying solely on textbook exercises available since 1990s!", "normalised": "These systems continuously monitor student performance, adjusting the difficulty level and content accordingly.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits extend beyond personalized content. Adaptive learning platforms can provide educators with valuable insights into student progress, allowing them to identify areas where students need extra support and adjust their teaching strategies accordingly. For example, if the teacher notices that a significant number of students are struggling with a particular concept after 15/08/1947, they can dedicate more time to that topic in class.", "normalised": "The benefits extend beyond personalized content.
