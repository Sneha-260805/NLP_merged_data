{"unnormalised": "Think of it as the biryani of education – customized to each individual's taste and needs. Instead of a fixed curriculum, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and AI to figure out what you *actually* know and where you're getting stuck. If Priya from Delhi Public School is acing algebra but tripping over trigonometry, the system will focus on trig. If Rohan in Kolkata needs a refresher on basic arithmetic before tackling fractions, it'll provide it. It's about personalized learning pathways, not just blasting through the syllabus.", "normalised": "Think of it as the biryani of education – customized to each individual's taste and needs.

Adaptive learning platforms can provide valuable data about student performance, allowing them to tailor their instruction and address specific learning gaps in a more targeted way. Instead of grading hundreds of papers, Mrs. Sharma can see at a glance which students need extra help with, say, the reign of Aurangzeb.", "normalised": "Plus, it helps teachers too!

It's the future of shiksha, and it's looking pretty bright! I read in the Hindu something about the govt. spending Rs. 200 Cr. on EdTech initatives. Let's hope some of that goes towards better adaptive learning tools.", "normalised": "This Onam, while you're enjoying a delicious sadhya, think about how adaptive learning can make education more fulfilling and effective for every student in India.
