{"unnormalised": "Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to identify knowledge gaps and areas of strength. Based on this analysis, the system dynamically adjusts the difficulty level, provides targeted feedback, and offers relevant resources. Think of it as having a personal tutor available 24/7. For example, if a student is struggling with quadratic equations during an online math class scheduled for 16/05/2024, the system might offer additional practice problems or step-by-step explanations before moving on.", "normalised": "Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to identify knowledge gaps and areas of strength.

{"unnormalised": "This personalized approach has significant benefits. Students learn at their own pace, reducing frustration and increasing engagement. Those who grasp concepts quickly can move ahead, while those who need more time receive the necessary support. This is particularly beneficial in diverse classrooms, catering to varying learning styles and abilities. Consider a class in a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Delhi; adaptive learning can ensure all students, regardless of their background, receive the support they need to succeed.", "normalised": "This personalized approach has significant benefits.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring access to technology and reliable internet connectivity, particularly in rural areas, is crucial. Furthermore, the development of high-quality, culturally relevant content is essential. The implementation of adaptive learning requires careful planning and teacher training, ensuring it complements traditional teaching methods, not replaces them. A workshop on 28/02/2025 at 11:00 hrs is planned to address these challenges.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
