{"unnormalised": "So, how does it work? Adaptive learning platforms leverage sophisticated algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's existing knowledge, identify areas of strength and weakness, and then adjust the difficulty and content accordingly. Imagine a student in Chennai struggling with algebra. The system will detect this, provide focused practice on specific problematic areas, and then re-assess before moving forward. This contrasts sharply with traditional classrooms where teachers may not have the bandwidth to provide such personalized attention to each of the 40+ students in their class.", "normalised": "So, how does it work?
