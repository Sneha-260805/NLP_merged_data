An adaptive system identifies Rohan’s weak areas, say solving linear equations, and provides him with targeted lessons, practice problems, and even hints specifically tailored to his understanding. As Rohan masters the concepts, the system automatically adjusts the difficulty, pushing him towards more complex problems.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms leverage algorithms and data analysis to personalize the learning experience.

Adaptive learning offers a flexible alternative, ensuring that no student is left behind while simultaneously challenging advanced learners. Institutes like IIT Madras are already exploring adaptive learning models to supplement their existing curriculum.", "normalised": "This contrasts sharply with the traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach often seen in Indian classrooms, where teachers strive to cover the syllabus at a predetermined pace.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are numerous. Students learn at their own pace, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Teachers are freed from repetitive instruction and can focus on providing individualized support and mentorship. Think of it as serving up education like a customized plate of biryani – each ingredient tailored to individual taste and preference.", "normalised": "The benefits are numerous.

Imagine a young girl, Priya, living in a remote village in Rajasthan, accessing a personalized learning program on a tablet. This levels the playing field and empowers her to achieve her full potential.", "normalised": "Moreover, adaptive learning can make quality education accessible to students in underserved regions of India, where resources may be limited.
