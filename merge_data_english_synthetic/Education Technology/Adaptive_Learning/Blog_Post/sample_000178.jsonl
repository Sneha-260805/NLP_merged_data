{"unnormalised": "In today's rapidly evolving education technology landscape, Adaptive Learning is emerging as a powerful tool for personalized education. Unlike traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches, adaptive learning utilizes algorithms and data analysis to adjust the pace and content of instruction to match the individual needs and learning styles of each student. Think of it like a skilled tutor, constantly assessing and modifying their teaching strategy.", "normalised": "In today's rapidly evolving education technology landscape, Adaptive Learning is emerging as a powerful tool for personalized education.

{"unnormalised": "Imagine a student in Chennai struggling with trigonometry. An adaptive learning platform can identify this weakness and provide targeted practice problems, video explanations, and even personalized feedback, ensuring they master the concept before moving on. Contrast this with the traditional classroom setting where the teacher might need to move on regardless of whether every student has fully grasped the concept.", "normalised": "Imagine a student in Chennai struggling with trigonometry.

{"unnormalised": "Just like the rich flavors of a carefully prepared biryani, with each ingredient perfectly balanced, adaptive learning aims to create a learning experience that is perfectly tailored to the individual needs of each student. As we look towards the future of education in India, adaptive learning promises to unlock the potential of every learner. As schools reopen post-pandemic, these technologies will be key. Investment in EdTech will grow by Rs. 20,000 crore in the next 5 years.", "normalised": "Just like the rich flavors of a carefully prepared biryani, with each ingredient perfectly balanced, adaptive learning aims to create a learning experience that is perfectly tailored to the individual needs of each student.
