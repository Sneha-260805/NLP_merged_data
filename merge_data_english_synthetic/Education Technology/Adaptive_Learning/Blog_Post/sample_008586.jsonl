Think of it like this: Imagine a student, Priya from Chennai, struggling with fractions in her Class 7 Maths syllabus at DAV School. Instead of forcing her to follow the same pace as the rest of the class, an adaptive learning platform identifies her specific areas of difficulty – say, adding fractions with unlike denominators.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to understand each student's strengths and weaknesses.

{"unnormalised": "The platform then provides Priya with targeted content, practice problems, and explanations focused solely on that area. As she masters the concept, the system automatically adjusts the difficulty level, ensuring she's continuously challenged and engaged. Conversely, if she's flying through a particular topic, like understanding percentages, the system can accelerate her learning and move on to more advanced concepts, preventing boredom and maximizing her learning time.", "normalised": "The platform then provides Priya with targeted content, practice problems, and explanations focused solely on that area.

For Kinjal in Ahmedabad, auditory learning might be more effective; the system can provide audio explanations and quizzes. This personalized approach fosters deeper understanding and improves retention.", "normalised": "The benefits are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "While challenges like implementation costs and data privacy concerns exist, the potential of adaptive learning to transform education in India, from remote villages to bustling metros, is undeniable. It allows us to move closer to a system where every student receives the support they need to succeed, regardless of their background or learning style. Just as we savor the rich flavours of a well-prepared biryani, layered with unique ingredients, adaptive learning allows for a similarly enriching educational experience, tailored to the unique palate of each student.", "normalised": "While challenges like implementation costs and data privacy concerns exist, the potential of adaptive learning to transform education in India, from remote villages to bustling metros, is undeniable.
