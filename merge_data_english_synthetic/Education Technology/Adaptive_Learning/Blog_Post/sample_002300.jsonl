{"unnormalised": "Unlike traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" methods, adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses. Based on this assessment, the system adjusts the difficulty level, content, and pacing of the material presented. For example, if a student struggles with a particular concept in Algebra, the system might provide additional examples, alternative explanations, or even prerequisite lessons before moving on.", "normalised": "Unlike traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" methods, adaptive learning platforms utilize algorithms and data analytics to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it as having a personal tutor available 24/7. These systems analyze student performance in real-time, identifying knowledge gaps and tailoring the learning path accordingly. This could be particularly beneficial in large Indian classrooms where individual attention can be limited. A student preparing for the IIT-JEE exam, for instance, could use an adaptive platform to focus on specific areas of weakness in Physics or Chemistry.", "normalised": "Think of it as having a personal tutor available twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of adaptive learning are manifold. It increases student engagement, improves learning outcomes, and reduces frustration. It also frees up teachers to focus on providing individualized support and guidance to students who need it most. Consider a scenario where a teacher in a Delhi school, at 11:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, uses data from an adaptive learning platform to identify students struggling with a specific grammar concept and dedicates extra time to address their needs.", "normalised": "The benefits of adaptive learning are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "Several institutions in India are already experimenting with adaptive learning technologies. From coaching centers in Kota to engineering colleges in Chennai, the potential is being explored across different educational levels. While challenges remain in terms of implementation and access, the future looks bright for adaptive learning in revolutionizing the Indian education system. A national-level conference on EdTech, scheduled for 15/12/2023 at 14:00 hrs, will further explore the adoption of these technologies. The vision is clear: to empower every student, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, with a personalized and effective learning journey. This ensures no child is left behind, echoing the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’s aim of ‘Education for All’.", "normalised": "Several institutions in India are already experimenting with adaptive learning technologies.
