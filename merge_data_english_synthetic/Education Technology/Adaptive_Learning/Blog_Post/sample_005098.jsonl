Traditional teaching, while having its own merits, often follows a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. That's where Adaptive Learning comes in – and it might just be the next big thing in EdTech, especially for us in India.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

It identifies knowledge gaps, adjusts the difficulty level, and provides personalized content and feedback. So, if Priya from Chennai is struggling with fractions, the system will offer her more practice problems and simpler explanations. But Rohan from Delhi, who's already a pro, will get more challenging exercises to push him further.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to tailor the learning experience to each student.
