{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: if one student from, say, DAV Public School, Chandigarh, grasps quadratic equations quickly, the platform will move them onto more challenging concepts. Conversely, if another student is struggling, the system will provide targeted support, perhaps revisiting foundational algebra concepts through interactive exercises and personalized videos. This prevents students from falling behind and ensures a solid understanding before progressing.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: if one student from, say, D A V Public School, Chandigarh, grasps quadratic equations quickly, the platform will move them onto more challenging concepts.

{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to track student performance in real-time. This allows the system to identify knowledge gaps and tailor the learning path accordingly. Imagine a student preparing for the IIT-JEE exam using an adaptive learning platform. The system would analyze their performance on practice questions, identifying weak areas like organic chemistry or calculus, and then provide them with focused resources and practice in those specific areas.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to track student performance in real-time.

{"unnormalised": "Just like a perfectly cooked biryani, where each ingredient is meticulously balanced to create a harmonious flavour, adaptive learning seeks to create a learning experience that is perfectly tailored to the individual learner. It is no longer about rote learning; it's about fostering deeper understanding and critical thinking.", "normalised": "Just like a perfectly cooked biryani, where each ingredient is meticulously balanced to create a harmonious flavour, adaptive learning seeks to create a learning experience that is perfectly tailored to the individual learner.

{"unnormalised": "While still relatively nascent in many parts of India, especially in rural areas where access to technology remains a challenge, the potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education is undeniable. Overcoming the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to these technologies are crucial next steps. The future of education in India, driven by EdTech innovations like adaptive learning, is bright. We can expect to see it increasingly integrated into classrooms and homes across the country in the coming years, improving learning outcomes for millions. This will need investments of, say, Rs. 100 crores to start.", "normalised": "While still relatively nascent in many parts of India, especially in rural areas where access to technology remains a challenge, the potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education is undeniable.
