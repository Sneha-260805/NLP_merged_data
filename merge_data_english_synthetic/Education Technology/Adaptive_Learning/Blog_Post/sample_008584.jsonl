But with adaptive learning, the system identifies his knowledge gaps and provides targeted content, practice problems, and hints tailored specifically to his areas of weakness. Similarly, Priya from IIT Delhi, excelling in the same subject, isn't held back by a rigid curriculum. She's challenged with more complex problems, accelerating her learning and fostering a deeper understanding.", "normalised": "Imagine Rajesh, a student from Chennai, struggling with algebra.

{"unnormalised": "The integration of adaptive learning into the Indian education system holds immense promise. From rural schools in Rajasthan to urban coaching centers in Kolkata, this technology can help bridge the learning gap and ensure that every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential. This technology can help us reach a target of 100% literacy rate in the coming years, even in remote areas kilometers away from the nearest school.", "normalised": "The integration of adaptive learning into the Indian education system holds immense promise.
