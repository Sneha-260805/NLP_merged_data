{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's knowledge and skills, identifying strengths and weaknesses in real-time. Based on this assessment, the system adjusts the difficulty level of the material presented, ensuring that the student is challenged appropriately without being overwhelmed. Think of it as having a personal tutor, guiding you through the intricacies of quadratic equations or the nuances of Indian history.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's knowledge and skills, identifying strengths and weaknesses in real-time.
