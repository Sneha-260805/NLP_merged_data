No more wasting time on stuff you already understand! Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and AI to personalize your learning journey. They track your progress, identify your weaknesses, and adjust the difficulty accordingly.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: your teacher, let's call her Missus Sharma from Delhi Public School, magically knew exactly which concepts you were struggling with and gave you extra practice ONLY on those areas.

But if you stumble, it provides extra resources, easier questions, and targeted feedback until you’ve nailed it. Think personalised tutoring, but at scale!", "normalised": "So, how does it work?
