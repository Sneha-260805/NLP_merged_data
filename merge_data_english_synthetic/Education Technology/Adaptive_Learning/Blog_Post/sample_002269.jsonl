{"unnormalised": "Imagine a student in a remote village in Rajasthan struggling with algebra. With adaptive learning, the platform identifies the specific areas where they're facing difficulties. Instead of moving on to more complex concepts, the system provides targeted practice problems and explanations. It's like having a personal tutor available 24/7! This is a huge leap from traditional classroom setups where the teacher, however dedicated, may find it difficult to cater to each student’s individual needs.", "normalised": "Imagine a student in a remote village in Rajasthan struggling with algebra.

{"unnormalised": "The core of adaptive learning lies in its intelligent algorithms. These algorithms continuously assess student performance, analyzing patterns and predicting future learning needs. For example, if a student consistently struggles with word problems in mathematics, the system might provide more visual aids and real-world examples, perhaps even referencing familiar scenarios from daily life in India.", "normalised": "The core of adaptive learning lies in its intelligent algorithms.

We need to foster this change starting from the ground level, beginning from 14/11/2024, Children's Day. Let's embrace the power of EdTech to empower every learner in our country, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Remember the PM's speech at 10:00 hrs on 26/01/1950 emphasizing nation-building through education! The benefits are visible, improving outcomes by an estimated 25% in some studies.
