{"unnormalised": "Imagine this: instead of forcing everyone to learn algebra at the same pace, the system figures out where each student struggles. Maybe Priya from Delhi is a whiz at solving equations but needs help with word problems. Adaptive learning uses algorithms and data to customize the learning path. So, Priya gets extra practice on word problems, while Rohan from Bangalore, who already aced those, can move on to geometry. Pretty neat, right?", "normalised": "Imagine this: instead of forcing everyone to learn algebra at the same pace, the system figures out where each student struggles.
