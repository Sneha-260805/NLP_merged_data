{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and AI to assess a student's current understanding of a subject. Based on this assessment, the system then adjusts the difficulty level and content presented to the student. Think of it as a personalized tutor that understands exactly where a student from say, a village near Patna, is struggling and provides targeted support.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms and A.I. to assess a student's current understanding of a subject.

{"unnormalised": "Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive learning offers a curriculum tailored to the individual. Students who grasp concepts quickly can move ahead, while those who need more support receive it without feeling left behind. This is particularly valuable in large classrooms, common in Indian schools, where teachers may struggle to cater to every student's needs individually.", "normalised": "Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive learning offers a curriculum tailored to the individual.

An adaptive learning platform could identify specific areas of weakness, like solving quadratic equations, and provide additional practice problems and tutorials until the student masters the concept. Only then would it move on to more complex topics.", "normalised": "Imagine a student struggling with algebra at I.I.T. coaching classes.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning isn't just about academics. It can also be used to develop crucial life skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. Platforms can adapt the difficulty level of simulations or games based on the student's performance, providing a challenging yet engaging learning experience.", "normalised": "Furthermore, adaptive learning isn't just about academics.

{"unnormalised": "This technology can be especially beneficial in bridging the educational gap between urban and rural areas. Access to quality teachers and resources can be limited in many rural schools, but adaptive learning platforms can provide personalized instruction and support regardless of location. Imagine celebrating Onam after achieving your target score using an adaptive platform in your remote Kerala village!", "normalised": "This technology can be especially beneficial in bridging the educational gap between urban and rural areas.

As adaptive learning continues to evolve, it has the potential to revolutionize education in India, creating a more equitable and effective learning experience for all students, leading to a future where every child can achieve their full potential. The price of some platforms ranges between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 20,000 per year.
