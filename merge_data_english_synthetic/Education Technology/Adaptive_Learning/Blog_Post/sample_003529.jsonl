{"unnormalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to adjust the difficulty and content of educational material based on a student's performance in real-time. Unlike the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional classrooms, adaptive learning platforms continuously assess a student's understanding and modify the learning path accordingly. If Priya from Chennai is struggling with fractions, the system automatically provides her with more foundational exercises. If Rohan from IIT Delhi quickly masters calculus, he's immediately presented with more challenging problems.", "normalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to adjust the difficulty and content of educational material based on a student's performance in real time.

Adaptive learning also allows teachers to focus their attention on students who need the most help, creating a more supportive and effective learning environment.

{"unnormalised": "Numerous EdTech companies in India are now incorporating adaptive learning into their platforms. For example, some platforms are designing adaptive modules for competitive exams like JEE and NEET, ensuring students master concepts before moving on to more advanced topics. These systems can analyze student performance across multiple subjects and provide targeted recommendations, helping students achieve their academic goals. Moreover, adaptive learning can also incorporate culturally relevant examples and scenarios, making the learning experience more relatable and engaging for students across India, from Srinagar to Kanyakumari. The goal is to make education more accessible and effective for every student, regardless of their background or learning style. The use of adaptive learning platforms is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, transforming the way education is delivered in India and beyond. Adaptive learning is not just about technology; it's about creating a more equitable and effective learning experience for every student. It is like understanding the nuances of Onam sadhya, where each dish complements the other, creating a holistic and satisfying experience.", "normalised": "Numerous Ed Tech companies in India are now incorporating adaptive learning into their platforms.
