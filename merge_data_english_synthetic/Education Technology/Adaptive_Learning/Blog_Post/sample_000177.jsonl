{"unnormalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to understand each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. Imagine a student struggling with quadratic equations. An adaptive learning platform can identify the specific concepts causing difficulty – perhaps factorization or the quadratic formula – and provide targeted support and practice exercises. Conversely, if a student masters a topic quickly, the platform can accelerate their progress, introducing more challenging material and preventing boredom.", "normalised": "At its core, adaptive learning uses algorithms and data analytics to understand each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style.

{"unnormalised": "However, successful implementation requires careful consideration. Access to technology, reliable internet connectivity (especially in rural areas where some villages are still dozens of km from the nearest internet tower), and teacher training are crucial. Furthermore, ensuring the cultural relevance and contextual appropriateness of the learning materials is vital. Imagine learning about fractions using examples related to sharing sweets during Diwali – far more relatable than abstract scenarios.", "normalised": "However, successful implementation requires careful consideration.
