{"unnormalised": "So, I've been digging into this whole \"Adaptive Learning\" thing lately. Basically, it's like having a personal tutor that understands your learning style and adjusts the curriculum *just* for you. Think of it as the '3 Idiots' movie IRL, tailoring education to individual aptitude, not just rote learning.", "normalised": "So, I've been digging into this whole \"Adaptive Learning\" thing lately.

{"unnormalised": "Instead of everyone in a class slogging through the same chapters at the same pace, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to figure out what you're struggling with and what you're acing. If Priya from Delhi is flying through algebra but needs help with geometry, the system will automatically give her more geometry practice. And maybe Rohan from Bangalore is the opposite. Cool, right?", "normalised": "Instead of everyone in a class slogging through the same chapters at the same pace, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to figure out what you're struggling with and what you're acing.

{"unnormalised": "The downside? Well, it could be expensive to implement on a large scale. And you need good data to make it work effectively. Plus, some people might miss the social aspect of learning in a traditional classroom.

Maybe it's the game changer to boost our nation's learning by many folds (easily 100x). Let’s discuss!", "normalised": "But overall, it seems pretty promising.
