{"unnormalised": "Adaptive learning, at its core, aims to personalize the learning experience for each student. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, the system adapts the difficulty and content based on the student's performance in real-time. Think of it like this: If Priya is struggling with trigonometry, the system will offer her simpler problems and foundational concepts until she grasps them. Meanwhile, Rohan, who's acing the topic, will be presented with more challenging problems and advanced applications.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning, at its core, aims to personalize the learning experience for each student.

Imagine implementing adaptive learning in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan schools nationwide! It could potentially bridge learning gaps and ensure that no child is left behind.", "normalised": "This has huge implications for a diverse country like India, where students come from varying educational backgrounds and learn at different paces.

The key lies in robust algorithms that accurately assess a student's knowledge and adjust the learning path accordingly.", "normalised": "Several platforms already offer adaptive learning features, from Khan Academy to more specialized solutions.

{"unnormalised": "Just like Raj challenged the traditional education system in *3 Idiots*, adaptive learning challenges the notion of standardized learning. It’s a paradigm shift with the potential to revolutionize how education is delivered in India, helping students learn at their own pace and reach their full potential. What are your thoughts on this? Let’s discuss!", "normalised": "Just like Raj challenged the traditional education system in *three Idiots*, adaptive learning challenges the notion of standardized learning.
