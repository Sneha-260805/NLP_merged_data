An adaptive learning system would identify this gap and provide targeted practice problems and explanations, perhaps even relating the concept to dividing a samosa amongst friends! If they ace it, the system moves on. If they still struggle, it provides further support.", "normalised": "Imagine a student in Patna struggling with fractions.

However, the potential benefits are enormous. Adaptive learning can democratize access to quality education, empowering students across the country to reach their full potential. Remember \"3 Idiots\"? The film highlighted the limitations of rote learning. Adaptive learning offers a path towards truly understanding concepts, not just memorizing them.
