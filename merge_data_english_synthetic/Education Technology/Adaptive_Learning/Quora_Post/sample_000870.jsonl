{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, I've been diving deep into Adaptive Learning lately, and I'm convinced it could be a game-changer for education in India. Imagine a system that actually *understands* where a student like Rohan from IIT-Delhi is struggling, and adjusts the learning path accordingly. No more one-size-fits-all lectures!", "normalised": "Hey everyone! So, I've been diving deep into Adaptive Learning lately, and I'm convinced it could be a game-changer for education in India.

But if Akash is stumbling with basic algebra, the system provides targeted help, maybe even pulling in extra practice problems or short videos. Think personalized tutoring, but scaled up!", "normalised": "Basically, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to personalize the learning experience.
