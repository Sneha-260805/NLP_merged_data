{"unnormalised": "Unlike traditional methods that often use a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses. Based on this assessment, the system automatically adjusts the difficulty level, content, and pace of learning. This ensures that students are consistently challenged but not overwhelmed, maximizing their learning potential.", "normalised": "unlike traditional methods that often use a one size fits all approach adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to assess a student's strengths and weaknesses based on this assessment the system automatically adjusts the difficulty level content and pace of learning this ensures that students are consistently challenged but not overwhelmed maximizing their learning potential"}
{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: Remember the movie \"3 Idiots\"? While a bit exaggerated, it highlights the issues of rote learning.

{"unnormalised": "Institutions like IIT Delhi are exploring adaptive learning techniques in their online programs to cater to a diverse student body with varying levels of prior knowledge. This personalized approach can be especially beneficial in a country like India, with its vast disparities in educational resources and access. For example, a student in rural Bihar with limited internet access can still benefit from offline adaptive learning tools that adjust based on their progress. The goal is to bridge the learning gap and empower every student to reach their full potential. What are your thoughts on its impact on the Indian Education System?", "normalised": "institutions like I I T delhi are exploring adaptive learning techniques in their online programs to cater to a diverse student body with varying levels of prior knowledge this personalized approach can be especially beneficial in a country like india with its vast disparities in educational resources and access for example a student in rural bihar with limited internet access can still benefit from offline adaptive learning tools that adjust based on their progress the goal is to bridge the learning gap and empower every student to reach their full potential what are your thoughts on its impact on the indian education system"}
