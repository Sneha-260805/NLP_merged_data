Based on this assessment, the system adjusts the difficulty level, content type, and delivery method. This means a student struggling with calculus at IIT-Bombay might get extra practice problems and explanations, while a student who's grasping it quickly can move on to more challenging topics.", "normalised": "The core concept revolves around algorithms that assess a student's knowledge gaps and strengths in real-time.
