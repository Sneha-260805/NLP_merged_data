It moves beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, using algorithms to personalize learning experiences for each student. Imagine a student in Patna struggling with calculus. Adaptive software can identify their specific knowledge gaps, maybe a shaky foundation in algebra, and provide targeted practice before moving forward.", "normalised": "Adaptive learning is gaining traction in EdTech, and for good reason.

Some may need to review basic physics principles first.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: Instead of everyone watching the same Bollywood film, 'three Idiots', and hoping they all grasp the engineering concepts, adaptive learning creates individual learning paths.

Ensuring accessibility for all students, particularly those in rural areas with limited internet connectivity, is crucial. Also, relying solely on algorithms could potentially stifle creativity and critical thinking, skills vital for success in a rapidly changing world.
