What are the actual results like in real classrooms? I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience with adaptive learning platforms. Are they worth the investment for schools like the ones in Uttar Pradesh, especially considering the cost per student (around rupee five thousand?) and the time commitment for teachers (planning from nine hundred hours to seventeen hundred hours)? Any experiences from parents in Chennai or teachers in Kolkata? Let’s discuss! What do you think? Post your comments before thirty first december two thousand and twenty four."}
