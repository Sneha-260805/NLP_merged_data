{"unnormalised": "Basically, adaptive learning is like having a personal tutor for every student. Imagine a system that understands that Rohan from IIT-Bombay excels at algorithms but needs help with data structures. The platform then adjusts the curriculum to focus on Rohan's weak areas, while also keeping him engaged with challenging algorithm problems. Cool, right?", "normalised": "Basically, adaptive learning is like having a personal tutor for every student.

Remember Rancho’s unconventional approach?
