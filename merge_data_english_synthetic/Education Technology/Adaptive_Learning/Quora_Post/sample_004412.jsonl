{"unnormalised": "So, I've been reading a lot about Adaptive Learning lately, and as an EdTech enthusiast based out of Bangalore, I'm pretty hyped. Basically, imagine a tutor, but digital, that understands *your* specific learning gaps. It adjusts the difficulty and content in real-time based on how well you're grasping the material. No more one-size-fits-all lectures that leave half the class scratching their heads!", "normalised": "So, I've been reading a lot about Adaptive Learning lately, and as an EdTech enthusiast based out of Bangalore, I'm pretty hyped.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone had personal experience with adaptive learning platforms? Maybe from Byju's or some other Indian EdTech startup? What are your thoughts? I'm curious if it lives up to the hype. I'm picturing a world where every student gets exactly what they need at 14:30 hrs on 02/10/2024 to succeed. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Even if it’s just 75% there by, say, 2028! My niece started using one on 16/06/2023 for her maths and she said it was better than her tuition sir!
