Think of it like this: remember that scene in 'three Idiots' where Rancho figures out everyone's learning style? Adaptive learning tries to do that for real, but with algorithms!"}
{"unnormalised": "**Quora Post: Education Technology - Adaptive Learning**", "normalised": "Basically, it is about tailoring education to each student's needs in real time. So, instead of everyone in class learning the same thing at the same pace, the system adjusts based on how well YOU are doing. If Priya from I I T Bombay is acing the calculus problems, she can move on to more challenging stuff. If Rohan from Delhi is struggling with basic fractions, he gets extra help and practice questions."}
