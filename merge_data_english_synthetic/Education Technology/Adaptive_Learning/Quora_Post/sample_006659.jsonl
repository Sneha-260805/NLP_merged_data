Some might be struggling with basic concepts like fractions, while others are ready to tackle calculus. (Okay, maybe not calculus, but you get the point!) Adaptive learning platforms use algorithms to figure out each student's strengths and weaknesses. So instead of one-size-fits-all lectures, little Radhika gets extra practice on fractions, while Rohan moves ahead to geometry."}

Sure. Good adaptive learning systems cost money, and you need reliable internet access (still a challenge in some parts of India). Plus, teachers need training to use them effectively. But honestly, at zero nine hundred hours daily, I strongly believe adaptive learning holds a huge potential, especially in a diverse country like ours, for helping every kid learn at their own pace and reach their full potential. What do you guys think?"}
