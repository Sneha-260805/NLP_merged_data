Think of it as Chintu getting exactly the kind of help he needs to crack the IIT-JEE exam.", "normalised": "Okay folks, let us talk adaptive learning! Heard the buzz but still scratching your head?

Struggle with quadratic equations? It'll give you more practice problems. Ace them? Boom! Moving on to calculus, maybe even touching upon concepts early, preparing Chintu for the 2024 entrance season!", "normalised": "Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach like those boring textbooks we used to cram from back in Delhi Public School, adaptive learning systems adjust the difficulty and content based on how *you* are performing.

It's true, good teachers like Mrs. Sharma from my school in Lucknow, cannot be completely replaced.
