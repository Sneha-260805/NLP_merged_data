{"unnormalised": "So, I've been hearing a lot about \"adaptive learning\" in education tech lately, and honestly, I'm both intrigued and a bit skeptical. Basically, it's supposed to be this fancy system where the learning material adjusts itself to *your* level. Like, if Rahul from IIT Delhi is breezing through calculus, it throws harder problems at him, while if Priya in Mumbai is struggling with basic algebra, it goes back and reinforces those fundamentals. Sounds cool, right?", "normalised": "So, I've been hearing a lot about \"adaptive learning\" in education tech lately, and honestly, I'm both intrigued and a bit skeptical.

{"unnormalised": "But my question is, how well does it *actually* work in practice? I mean, sure, on paper, it's like Dronacharya tailoring his teachings to Arjuna's specific skills, (remember that from the Mahabharata? Think *Eklavya* storyline but personalized and with better tech). But can these algorithms really capture the nuances of how a human being learns? Does it account for the bad samosa you had that day that made you unable to concentrate?", "normalised": "But my question is, how well does it *actually* work in practice?
