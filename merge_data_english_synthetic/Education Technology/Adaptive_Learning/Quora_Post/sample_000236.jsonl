Seems like every online course from Byju's to that new J E E prep app my cousin, Rohan, is using, is touting it. But is it just marketing fluff, or is it the real deal?"}

Like, if you are struggling with vectors in Physics, which, let us be honest, who is not, it will give you more practice problems on vectors before moving on. And if you ace calculus like a boss, it will skip ahead to more advanced stuff. Think of it as personalized tutoring, but powered by algorithms!"}

From what I have seen, it can be pretty effective, especially for subjects like Maths and Science. It is like D D L J – finally, some customized attention! It helps you identify and fill the gaps in your knowledge, which is super important. I think adaptive learning has the potential to really shake up education in India, but it is still early days. What are your experiences with it? Share your thoughts!"}
