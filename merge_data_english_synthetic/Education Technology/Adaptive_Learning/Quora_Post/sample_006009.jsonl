Like, if you're acing the calculus problems, it throws in harder ones. But if you're struggling with trigonometry, it gives you more practice problems and maybe even some Khan Academy-style videos to re-learn the basics. Sounds pretty cool, right?"}

Is adaptive learning really going to revolutionize how we teach kids in schools and colleges across India, even in places like my hometown, Kanpur? Anyone have experience with specific adaptive learning platforms or seen them used in Indian schools? Share your thoughts! I'm eager to hear what you all think. Maybe the next big thing will be adaptive learning centers in every Tier two city in India. Rupee five hundred per month subscription, anyone?"}
