{"unnormalised": "So, I've been reading a lot about adaptive learning lately and I'm genuinely curious about its potential, especially in the context of Indian education. Think about it: how often did we all, back in school (DPS Delhi anyone?), feel like we were either lagging behind or getting bored because the pace was too slow? That's where adaptive learning comes in, right?", "normalised": "So, I've been reading a lot about adaptive learning lately and I'm genuinely curious about its potential, especially in the context of Indian education.

{"unnormalised": "It's basically like having a personalized tutor, only it's a program! It figures out what you already know and then serves up content that's just right for you. Imagine a student in, say, Lucknow, struggling with Trigonometry. An adaptive learning platform could identify the specific concepts they're missing and give them extra practice, instead of making them repeat the entire chapter.", "normalised": "It's basically like having a personalized tutor, only it's a program!

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know some people are worried about losing the human element. What about the teacher-student connection? And can these algorithms really understand the nuances of learning styles? Also, cost! Will good adaptive learning platforms be accessible to kids in rural areas by 2030?", "normalised": "Now, I know some people are worried about losing the human element.

{"unnormalised": "But honestly, if done right, it could be a game changer. Think about preparing for the JEE exam, adaptive learning could pinpoint weak areas and create a custom study plan.
