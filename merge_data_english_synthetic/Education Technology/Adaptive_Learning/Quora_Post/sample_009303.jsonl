{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I've been hearing a lot about adaptive learning lately. It sounds pretty cool – like a personal tutor that actually *gets* what you're struggling with. Basically, from what I understand, it's using tech to tailor the learning experience to each student's individual needs. Think of it like this: instead of everyone in class going at the same pace, like in those old-school Doon School classrooms, the software figures out what you know and what you don't, and then adjusts the difficulty level accordingly.", "normalised": "Okay, so I've been hearing a lot about adaptive learning lately.
