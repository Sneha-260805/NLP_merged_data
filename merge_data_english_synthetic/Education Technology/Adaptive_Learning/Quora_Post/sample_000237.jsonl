{"unnormalised": "So, basically, Adaptive Learning is like having a personal tutor for every student. Think about it – no more one-size-fits-all lectures where some kids are bored stiff and others are totally lost. Instead, the system adjusts the difficulty based on how well you're grasping the concepts. If Rohan is struggling with fractions, the system gives him extra practice. But if Priya's acing geometry, she moves on to more challenging stuff.", "normalised": "So, basically, Adaptive Learning is like having a personal tutor for every student.
