{"unnormalised": "It reminds me of the Bollywood film '3 Idiots,' which challenged the rote learning system. Adaptive learning could be a step towards a more engaging and effective educational experience for all students, moving away from \"rattafication\" towards genuine understanding. But careful planning and implementation are essential for it to truly succeed and not become just another expensive gimmick.
