{"unnormalised": "Simply put, adaptive learning uses algorithms and AI to personalize the learning experience for each student. Imagine a math module where Rohan in Delhi is struggling with algebra. The system detects this and provides him with extra practice problems, and perhaps even breaks down the concepts into smaller, more manageable chunks. Meanwhile, Priya in Mumbai who is breezing through algebra, gets challenged with more advanced problems, keeping her engaged and stimulated.", "normalised": "Simply put, adaptive learning uses algorithms and A I to personalize the learning experience for each student.

Unlike a one-size-fits-all curriculum, adaptive learning systems can identify knowledge gaps and tailor content accordingly, potentially leading to better learning outcomes.
