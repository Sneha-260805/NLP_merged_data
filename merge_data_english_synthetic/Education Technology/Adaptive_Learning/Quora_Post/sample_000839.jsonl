{"unnormalised": "Basically, it's about using technology to personalize the learning experience for each student. Imagine a system that figures out that Rohan in Delhi struggles with quadratic equations but is a whiz at trigonometry. Instead of forcing him through the same pace as everyone else in the class, the system gives him extra practice on the quadratic stuff and lets him zoom ahead in trig. Pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Basically, it is about using technology to personalize the learning experience for each student.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Cost is a big one, making it accessible in rural areas and government schools will be tough. We also need to ensure the tech is culturally relevant and engaging for Indian students. The first pilot program started on 01/01/2023 and the results are expected by 30/06/2024. And, honestly, ensuring teachers are comfortable using these tools is crucial. My cousin, Priya who teaches in a school in Rajasthan, struggles with even basic computers sometimes! She asked me about this on 10/10/2023 at 09:00 hrs, and I really had to explain it to her.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.
