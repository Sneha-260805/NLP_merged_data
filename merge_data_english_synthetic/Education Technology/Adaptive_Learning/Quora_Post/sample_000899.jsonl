Okay, so everyone is buzzing about \"Adaptive Learning\" in edtech, right? But is it actually living up to the hype? I am thinking about it for my kid, Rohan, who is struggling a bit with Maths. The tuition classes are draining my wallet, rupee five hundred per hour, and frankly, they feel like a one-size-fits-all approach. Adaptive learning, as I understand it, is like having a super-smart tutor that tailors the learning path based on how Rohan is doing. Good concept! Some platforms even boast personalized lesson plans that adapt in real-time. No more boring textbook exercises! He could focus only on Trigonometry if that is where he is messing up instead of redoing entire chapters, like in the usual C B S E curriculum. Has anyone had real success with these platforms? I have heard some companies like Byju's and Vedantu use aspects of adaptive learning, but I want to hear from parents especially from India! Does it really boost grades? Does it keep kids engaged, or does it just feel like more homework? Bonus points if you can recommend some good resources. Rohan has an exam coming up on the twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty five at ten zero zero hours and I am stressing out! I even saw a presentation about A I and Adaptive Learning at I I T Bombay back in two thousand and twenty. Was pretty impressive, but is it actually affordable and effective for a middle-class family in, say, Jaipur? Help a fellow parent out! I need to decide by tenth october two thousand and twenty four. Thanks!"}
