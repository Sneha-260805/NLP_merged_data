{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk Adaptive Learning! Heard a lot about it, especially in the context of EdTech here in India. Basically, it’s using technology to personalize the learning journey for each student, right? Like, instead of everyone going through the same chapter on quadratic equations at the same pace, some kids who get it quickly can zoom ahead, while others who are struggling get extra help.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let us talk Adaptive Learning!

And, realistically, when will we see widespread adoption – by 2025? 2030? Or even later than 15/08/1947? Let’s discuss! Maybe someone has insights from using platforms like Byju's or Vedantu. Is the adaptive part truly working for you at 09:00 hrs or is it just clever marketing? Share your experiences from Mumbai to Kolkata! I'd love to hear about specific examples, even if it's just from your tuition classes on 26/01/2024.", "normalised": "What are your thoughts?
