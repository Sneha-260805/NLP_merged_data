{"unnormalised": "From what I understand, it's supposed to personalize learning based on how you're doing. Like, if Priya is struggling with quadratic equations, the system will give her more problems on that before moving on. If Rahul whizzes through trigonometry, it'll skip ahead to something more challenging. Makes sense in theory, right? No more boring lectures repeating stuff you already know (thank God!).", "normalised": "From what I understand, it is supposed to personalize learning based on how you are doing.
