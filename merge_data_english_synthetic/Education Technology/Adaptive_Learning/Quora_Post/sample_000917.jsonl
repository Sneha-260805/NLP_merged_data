{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, I’ve been diving deep into this whole 'Adaptive Learning' thing lately, and I gotta say, it's pretty darn interesting. Imagine a learning system that actually understands *your* learning style and adjusts accordingly. No more forcing everyone to learn the same thing, the same way, at the same pace!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it – Ram from my tuitions always struggled with Algebra. With adaptive learning, he could get extra help on the concepts he finds tough, maybe even visualise it with simulations made specifically for him. Meanwhile, Priya, who’s already acing it, can zoom ahead to more advanced stuff. No one’s held back, and no one’s left behind. Pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "Think about it – Ram from my tuitions always struggled with Algebra.
