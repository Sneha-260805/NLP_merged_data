Imagine a student in rural Bihar, say Rajesh, struggling with algebraic equations. With adaptive learning software, the system identifies his specific weaknesses and provides targeted practice problems, explanations, and even adjusts the difficulty level in real-time. No more one-size-fits-all lecturing like in three Idiots’ Rancho's classroom!"}

Access to reliable internet connectivity, especially in remote areas, remains a hurdle. The cost of implementing adaptive learning software and training educators is also a significant factor. Further, ensuring cultural relevance and avoiding biases in the algorithms is crucial.
