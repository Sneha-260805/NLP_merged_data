What are your thoughts on Adaptive Learning in EdTech these days?", "normalised": "It feels like everyone's talking about it, but is it actually living up to the hype, especially here in India? I mean, we've got such diverse learning needs, from students in I I T Delhi prepping for placements to kids in small villages in Rajasthan without reliable internet access. Can one system really adapt to all of that?"}

What are the pros and cons you've seen? Did it actually improve learning outcomes, or just add another layer of complexity? Specifically, has anyone tried using it for competitive exams like J E E?

Maybe we can even chat more at seven P M on second october two thousand and twenty three? Let's discuss!"}
