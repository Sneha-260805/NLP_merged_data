While still relatively nascent in the Indian context, especially in rural areas where digital access remains a challenge, the potential for adaptive learning to revolutionize our education system is immense. It can address the issue of overcrowded classrooms and uneven teaching quality by providing personalized support to each student. But the key lies in ensuring equitable access and culturally relevant content for all, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.", "normalised": "Institutions like I I T Delhi are exploring and implementing adaptive learning modules to cater to the diverse learning speeds and styles of their students.
