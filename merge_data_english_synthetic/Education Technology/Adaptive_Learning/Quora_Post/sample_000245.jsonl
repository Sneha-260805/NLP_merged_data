They use algorithms to figure out where you're strong and where you're struggling. Think of it like this: if you ace the questions on, say, quadratic equations (thanks, RD Sharma!), it'll move you on to tougher stuff, maybe integration next (IIT-JEE prep, anyone?). But if you're tripping over the basics, it'll give you more practice problems and explain the concepts in different ways.
