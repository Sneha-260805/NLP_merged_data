Is it really the future of education, yaar?**", "normalised": "so, I have been hearing a lot about \"adaptive learning\" lately, especially with all the ed-tech startups popping up in Bangalore and Mumbai. basically, it is like having a personalized tutor who really knows your strengths and weaknesses. think of it as the opposite of those massive, one-size-fits-all classes we all suffered through back in school, maybe even those grueling I I T-J E E coaching sessions."}

I am particularly interested in experiences from Indian students. let us discuss!"}
