{"unnormalised": "Basically, as I understand it, adaptive learning platforms adjust the difficulty and content based on how Rohan is performing. Like, if he's acing calculus problems, it'll move him on to more complex stuff. But if he's struggling with, say, trigonometry, it'll provide more practice problems and explanations. Sounds way better than just grinding through the same textbook, chapter after chapter, right? Especially if that textbook is H.C.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone actually used adaptive learning platforms for their kids, especially for competitive exams like JEE or NEET? Any recommendations for good platforms in India? Did you see an improvement in their performance? My wife, Priya, is especially concerned about the cost. Are they worth the investment, considering coaching centers in Kota charge like Rs. 1.5 Lakhs these days? Rohan's demo class is on 26/01/2024 at 14:00 hrs. We need to decide by 10/10/2023! Any insights will be super helpful! Thanks in advance! Hoping this tech can improve things for the next generation - Jai Hind!", "normalised": "Has anyone actually used adaptive learning platforms for their kids, especially for competitive exams like J E E or N E E T?
