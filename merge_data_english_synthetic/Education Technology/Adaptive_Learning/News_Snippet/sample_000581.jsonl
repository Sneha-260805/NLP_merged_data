{"unnormalised": "Education experts suggest that adaptive learning could significantly improve learning outcomes, especially in subjects like mathematics, where a strong foundation is crucial. The concept is somewhat akin to the '3 Idiots' approach of understanding rather than rote learning, resonating with a changing educational philosophy. Several schools in Mumbai and Chennai are also implementing adaptive learning solutions for primary and secondary levels, showing a growing nationwide interest. Early results are promising, with reported increases in student engagement and comprehension.", "normalised": "Education experts suggest that adaptive learning could significantly improve learning outcomes, especially in subjects like mathematics, where a strong foundation is crucial.
