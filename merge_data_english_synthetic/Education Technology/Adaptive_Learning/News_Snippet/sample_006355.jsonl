Institutions like I I T-Bombay are piloting A I-powered platforms that dynamically adjust curriculum difficulty based on individual student performance and learning styles. Early results indicate improved comprehension and retention rates, particularly in subjects like mathematics and science. The shift aims to address the diverse learning needs within large classrooms, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach. \"Just like the characters in 'three Idiots' learned in different ways,\" stated Doctor Priya Sharma, Head of EdTech Initiatives at the Ministry of Education, \"adaptive learning acknowledges that every student absorbs information uniquely.\" Several EdTech companies are developing affordable, localized solutions tailored to the Indian context, incorporating regional languages and cultural nuances. Government initiatives are offering subsidies and training programs to facilitate wider implementation, hoping to bridge the educational gap between urban and rural areas. The projected market size for adaptive learning in India is estimated at rupee five thousand crores by two thousand and twenty seven. Concerns regarding data privacy and equitable access are being addressed by regulatory bodies."}
