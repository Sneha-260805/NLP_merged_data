{"unnormalised": "I'm especially interested in apps that help with Maths and Physics. I heard Embibe is good for that. Anyone have any experiences to share, especially with apps useful for JEE/ NEET preps? Any tips on making the most of them without getting overwhelmed? Also, are there any free or affordable options? My pocket money only stretches so far, you know! I've got like Rs. 500 left! Any recommendations based on the recent exam pattern changes, like post the 15/08/2023 syllabus update, would be great.
