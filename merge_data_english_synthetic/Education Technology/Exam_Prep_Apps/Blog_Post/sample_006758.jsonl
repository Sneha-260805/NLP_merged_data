Plus, they’ve got practice papers from the last 10 years! Another app that’s doing the rounds is \"Prep Zone\", particularly popular for competitive exams like IIT-JEE and NEET.

Think of them as a spicy plate of biryani – delicious and satisfying, but only if you actually *eat* it! (And maybe a little raita on the side for that extra edge).
