Too much inventory, and your working capital is tied up like Rs. 5 lakhs sitting idle in the godown, plus you’re paying for storage (think 1000 sq ft space near Bhiwandi costing a fortune). Too little, and you're losing sales and goodwill – imagine running out of Mysore Pak during Dasara!", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at I I M Ahmedabad always emphasized its importance.
