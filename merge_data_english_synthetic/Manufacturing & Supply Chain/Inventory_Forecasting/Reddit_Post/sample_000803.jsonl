I'm Rajeev from Mumbai, and I've been wrestling with inventory forecasting for the past 15 years at my family's textile business. We make everything from fine silk sarees to sturdy Khadi kurtas. Getting it right is crucial - overstocking those Diwali-themed kurtas is a financial disaster, while running out of raw cotton means losing valuable orders.", "normalised": "Namaste, fellow manufacturers and supply chain gurus!

Traditional methods like simple moving averages can be useful, especially for predictable items, say, the demand for basic white cotton fabric (consistent demand, year-round).

For example, we saw a 15% reduction in wasted fabric due to over-ordering after implementing a predictive model for festive season demand. This considers factors like inflation (Rs.), marketing spend, and even the Monsoon's impact on cotton harvests in Maharashtra.", "normalised": "We've started experimenting with A R I M A models and even some machine learning algorithms.

Ensure clean historical sales data, vendor lead times (in days or weeks), production capacity (say, 5000 sq ft workshop can produce X units), and consider external factors (Dr. Sharma's economic forecasts from IIM Bangalore are pretty reliable!). Also, don't underestimate the \"gut feeling\" of your sales team – they're often the first to sense a shift in trends, especially in the handloom sector. Any insights from your end?
