{"unnormalised": "I'm working on optimizing inventory forecasting for a textile manufacturing unit in Surat. We primarily deal with cotton fabrics, around 50,000 sq ft of warehousing. Right now, we're mostly using historical data (last 2 years) and gut feeling (my boss calls it 'Gujarat intuition'!), which, as you can imagine, isn't very accurate. We often end up with either excess stock tying up Rs. 5 Lakhs, or stockouts costing us valuable orders, especially around Diwali.", "normalised": "i am working on optimizing inventory forecasting for a textile manufacturing unit in surat. we primarily deal with cotton fabrics, around fifty thousand square feet of warehousing. right now, we are mostly using historical data (last two years) and gut feeling (my boss calls it 'gujarat intuition'!), which, as you can imagine, is not very accurate. we often end up with either excess stock tying up rupee five lakhs, or stockouts costing us valuable orders, especially around diwali."}
