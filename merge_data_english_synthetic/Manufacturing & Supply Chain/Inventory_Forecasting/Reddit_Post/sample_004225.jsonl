{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, tackling inventory forecasting can feel like navigating the Mumbai local during peak hours, chaotic! But mastering it is crucial to keep your manufacturing line humming smoothly. Think about it: too much inventory ties up capital (Rs.), leading to storage costs (think hundreds of sq ft of godown space in Bhiwandi!), and obsolescence. Too little, and you're staring at production delays.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, tackling inventory forecasting can feel like navigating the Mumbai local during peak hours, chaotic!

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the secret sauce? I've found a few things particularly helpful. Firstly, historical data is your best friend. Analyze past sales data for seasonal trends (Diwali rush, anyone?), promotions, and even external factors like monsoons in Kerala affecting rubber production. Secondly, consider demand forecasting techniques. Are you using simple moving averages or more sophisticated models like ARIMA? Dr. Sharma at IIT Bombay has some excellent research papers on this!", "normalised": "So, what is the secret sauce? I have found a few things particularly helpful.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, incorporate supplier lead times. If your raw material supply chain stretches from Nagpur to Chennai, a delay in transportation (especially with unpredictable rail freight) can throw everything off. Fourthly, don't forget safety stock! A buffer for unexpected surges in demand or supplier hiccups is essential, particularly for critical components.", "normalised": "Thirdly, incorporate supplier lead times.
