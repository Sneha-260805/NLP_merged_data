{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, let's talk inventory forecasting, a critical aspect often overlooked in Indian manufacturing. Imagine a situation like Rajan bhai's mithai shop in Surat - he needs to ensure he has enough jalebi for Diwali, but not so much that half of it goes stale by Bhai Dooj! That's where accurate forecasting comes in.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, let's talk inventory forecasting, a critical aspect often overlooked in Indian manufacturing.

We can use various techniques - simple moving averages (good for relatively stable demand, like, say, steel rods), time series analysis (think predicting fertilizer sales based on monsoon patterns), and even more complex machine learning algorithms.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is all about predicting future demand for your products.
