Bad forecasting can lead to either excess stock eating into your profits (like paying tax when the rains fail!) or stockouts that cripple production and damage customer loyalty."}

For instance, predicting demand for spare parts in tier-two cities like Nagpur requires a different approach than forecasting for scooters in Mumbai. Factors like monsoon season impacting transportation to remote areas, the festival season affecting consumption patterns, and even local elections influencing purchasing power all play a role."}

Simple moving averages work okay for stable items, but for newer products or seasonal items like Diwali lights, we're exploring more sophisticated methods like A R I M A and even incorporating machine learning models. The I I M Ahmedabad's Supply Chain Management program has some great research on this. Remember that scene in Swades where Mohan Bhargav analyzes data to understand the village's needs? It's kind of like that, but with a lot more spreadsheets!"}
