While it works okay for stable demand items like basic cotton fabric, it completely fails when there's a surge – think sudden demand for silk sarees before a wedding season or a festival like Onam! We ended up air freighting 1000 silk sarees from Bangalore at a huge cost!", "normalised": "I am curious about the strategies you all use.
