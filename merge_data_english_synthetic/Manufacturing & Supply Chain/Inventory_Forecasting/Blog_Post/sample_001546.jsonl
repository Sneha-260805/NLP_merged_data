{"unnormalised": "Inventory. It's the lifeblood of any manufacturing unit, especially in a diverse market like India. Too much, and you're staring at obsolete stock and tied-up capital, like Rs. 5 Lakhs worth of sarees sitting unsold at a shop in Varanasi. Too little, and you're facing stockouts, disgruntled customers (think losing that crucial Diwali order from a prominent Mumbai retailer) and production line halts. That's where inventory forecasting comes in, acting as your crystal ball for supply chain management.", "normalised": "Inventory.

{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is essentially predicting future demand to optimize inventory levels. It helps businesses like Tata Steel or a smaller textile mill in Tirupur, Tamil Nadu decide how much raw material (e.g., cotton, steel coils) to order, how much finished goods to produce, and where to store them (perhaps in a 10,000 sq ft warehouse near Bhiwandi).", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is essentially predicting future demand to optimize inventory levels.

{"unnormalised": "Effective inventory forecasting can lead to significant cost savings, improved customer satisfaction, and better resource utilization. Just ask Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad, who’s been researching supply chain optimization for years – he'll tell you it's crucial. Ultimately, understanding and utilizing inventory forecasting tools is essential for thriving in today's competitive manufacturing and supply chain landscape. Ignoring it is like trying to navigate the bustling streets of Chandni Chowk blindfolded – chaotic and potentially disastrous.", "normalised": "Effective inventory forecasting can lead to significant cost savings, improved customer satisfaction, and better resource utilization.
