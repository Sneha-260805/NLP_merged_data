{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is the backbone of any successful manufacturing and supply chain operation, especially crucial as India pushes for a stronger ‘Make in India’ initiative. Imagine a festive season surge in demand for silk sarees in Varanasi, or a sudden spike in orders for steel tiffin boxes in Mumbai. Without accurate forecasts, manufacturers risk losing out on sales, tying up capital in excess inventory, or facing crippling shortages.", "normalised": "inventory forecasting is the backbone of any successful manufacturing and supply chain operation, especially crucial as india pushes for a stronger ‘make in india’ initiative. imagine a festive season surge in demand for silk sarees in varanasi, or a sudden spike in orders for steel tiffin boxes in mumbai. without accurate forecasts, manufacturers risk losing out on sales, tying up capital in excess inventory, or facing crippling shortages."}
{"unnormalised": "Effective inventory forecasting helps businesses, from small scale textile units in Tirupur to large automotive component manufacturers near Pune, optimise their stock levels. This means predicting the quantity of raw materials (like cotton or steel), work-in-progress, and finished goods required at various points in the supply chain. Techniques range from simple moving averages, where you use past sales data (e.g., the last 6 months' sales) to predict future demand, to more sophisticated methods employing statistical modeling and machine learning.", "normalised": "effective inventory forecasting helps businesses, from small scale textile units in tirupur to large automotive component manufacturers near pune, optimise their stock levels. this means predicting the quantity of raw materials (like cotton or steel), work-in-progress, and finished goods required at various points in the supply chain. techniques range from simple moving averages, where you use past sales data (e.g., the last six months' sales) to predict future demand, to more sophisticated methods employing statistical modeling and machine learning."}

{"unnormalised": "Why is this so important? Holding excess inventory ties up valuable capital. Rs. 5 lakhs sitting in a warehouse in Bangalore, representing unsold stock, could be used for marketing or R&D. Conversely, stockouts can damage customer relationships and lead to lost sales.

If a company misjudges demand, it might end up paying extra for expedited shipping from Chennai to Delhi or renting additional warehouse space (say, 5000 sq ft) on short notice.", "normalised": "moreover, inaccurate forecasting contributes to inefficiencies in logistics. if a company misjudges demand, it might end up paying extra for expedited shipping from chennai to delhi or renting additional warehouse space (say, five thousand square feet) on short notice."}
{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, robust inventory forecasting is about striking the right balance – having enough stock to meet customer demand without incurring excessive holding costs. For Indian manufacturers looking to compete globally, investing in accurate forecasting tools and techniques is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity. Just ask Mr. Patil, the owner of a thriving auto parts factory in Nashik, who doubled his profits after implementing a new forecasting system.", "normalised": "ultimately, robust inventory forecasting is about striking the right balance – having enough stock to meet customer demand without incurring excessive holding costs. for indian manufacturers looking to compete globally, investing in accurate forecasting tools and techniques is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity. just ask mister patil, the owner of a thriving auto parts factory in nashik, who doubled his profits after implementing a new forecasting system."}
