{"unnormalised": "Why is this so important? Well, imagine a company like Tata Steel. Overestimating demand means tying up capital in excess inventory, increasing storage costs (think of all those extra sq ft needed!) and potentially leading to obsolescence. Underestimating, on the other hand, leads to stockouts, delayed orders, and disgruntled customers like Mr. Sharma waiting for his construction steel. Nobody wants that!", "normalised": "Why is this so important? Well, imagine a company like Tata Steel.
