{"unnormalised": "Several forecasting methods exist. Simple moving average is akin to listening to the wisdom of your Dadi – a basic but reliable starting point. For more complex scenarios, techniques like exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are employed, taking into account seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns.

Accurate forecasting helps them anticipate the demand for cotton yarn (in kg), dye, and even the availability of skilled labor. Poor forecasting could mean delayed deliveries, impacting their bottom line and damaging relationships with retailers like Pantaloons.", "normalised": "Consider a garment factory in Tirupur, manufacturing t-shirts.
