Overstocking means tying up capital and potentially having unsold sarees after the festive season, leading to markdowns (Rs. losses!). Understocking, on the other hand, means lost sales and unhappy customers, like Lakshmi Aunty who couldn’t find the perfect silk saree for her daughter’s wedding.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: you’re running a Saree manufacturing unit in Kanchipuram.

{"unnormalised": "So, how do we avoid these scenarios? That's where inventory forecasting comes in. Several methods exist, ranging from simple to sophisticated. Simple techniques like trend analysis use historical data (e.g., sales figures from the past 5 years) to project future demand. More advanced methods, often taught at IIT-Delhi's Industrial Engineering department, involve statistical models that consider various factors: seasonality (like the Diwali rush!), promotions, and even external factors like changes in GST rates.", "normalised": "So, how do we avoid these scenarios?
