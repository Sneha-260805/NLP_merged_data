{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is crucial for smooth operations in any manufacturing setup, especially in a complex market like India. Think of it as consulting a Pandit to understand future demand instead of reading a Janam Kundali! It allows businesses to anticipate customer needs, optimise stock levels, and minimise losses. Without accurate forecasting, a company risks being either overstocked, leading to storage costs and potential obsolescence, or understocked, resulting in lost sales and dissatisfied customers like Mrs. Sharma who couldn’t get her favourite Mysore Silk saree in time for Diwali.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is crucial for smooth operations in any manufacturing setup, especially in a complex market like India.

{"unnormalised": "Effective forecasting involves analysing historical sales data, current market trends, and seasonal fluctuations. For example, a textile mill in Surat needs to accurately predict the demand for cotton fabrics before the Navratri season to avoid disappointing retailers. Techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, and regression analysis are employed. Dr. Patel from IIT Bombay has been doing some great work in developing AI-powered forecasting models specifically for the Indian FMCG sector.", "normalised": "Effective forecasting involves analyzing historical sales data, current market trends, and seasonal fluctuations.

Holding excess inventory ties up capital – imagine Rs. 5 Lakh worth of raw materials lying unused in a 1000 sq ft warehouse. Moreover, outdated inventory might have to be sold at a discount, further impacting profits.", "normalised": "Poor forecasting can lead to significant financial losses.
