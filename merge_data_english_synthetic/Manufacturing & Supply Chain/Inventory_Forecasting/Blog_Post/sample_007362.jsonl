{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is the bedrock of efficient manufacturing and a smooth supply chain, crucial for businesses of all sizes in India, from the bustling markets of Chandni Chowk to modern industrial hubs in Pune. Accurate forecasting ensures optimal stock levels, minimizing both stockouts (think frantic calls from distributors in Coimbatore complaining they're out of stock of Diwali sweets!) and excess inventory (which ties up valuable capital – Rs. you could be investing elsewhere).", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is the bedrock of efficient manufacturing and a smooth supply chain, crucial for businesses of all sizes in India, from the bustling markets of Chandni Chowk to modern industrial hubs in Pune.

{"unnormalised": "Why is it so important? Imagine a textile manufacturer in Surat, relying on outdated spreadsheets. Without accurate predictions, they might overproduce silk sarees based on last year's demand. This leads to storage problems – needing more expensive warehouse space (easily costing Rs. 50,000 per month for a 2,000 sq ft godown) – and the risk of unsold inventory depreciating, especially with changing fashion trends. Conversely, underestimating demand can result in lost sales and damaged reputation.", "normalised": "Why is it so important? Imagine a textile manufacturer in Surat, relying on outdated spreadsheets. Without accurate predictions, they might overproduce silk sarees based on last year's demand. This leads to storage problems – needing more expensive warehouse space (easily costing rupee fifty thousand per month for a two thousand square feet godown) – and the risk of unsold inventory depreciating, especially with changing fashion trends. Conversely, underestimating demand can result in lost sales and damaged reputation."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence forecasting. Seasonality plays a huge role; demand for agricultural equipment in Punjab peaks during the sowing and harvesting seasons. Economic conditions, like inflation rates, impact consumer spending and, therefore, demand. Marketing campaigns also create surges in product interest. For example, a new Bollywood movie featuring a particular brand of clothing can create a sudden spike in sales.", "normalised": "Several factors influence forecasting.

{"unnormalised": "Various methods are employed, from simple moving averages to sophisticated statistical models. Qualitative methods, relying on expert opinions (like consulting experienced distributors or factory managers), are also valuable, especially when dealing with new product launches.
