{"unnormalised": "In the complex world of manufacturing and supply chain management, inventory forecasting is the art of predicting future demand to optimize stock levels. Think of it like this: before a big Indian wedding in Jaipur, you need to accurately estimate how much daal, roti, and everything else you'll need. Too little, and guests go hungry. Too much, and you’re stuck with leftovers for weeks!", "normalised": "In the complex world of manufacturing and supply chain management, inventory forecasting is the art of predicting future demand to optimize stock levels.

{"unnormalised": "Effective inventory forecasting helps companies like Tata Steel or Mahindra avoid both stockouts and overstocking. Overstocking ties up valuable capital in the form of raw materials, work-in-progress, or finished goods sitting idle in a warehouse – occupying precious sq ft of space that could be used more efficiently. Stockouts, on the other hand, can lead to lost sales, dissatisfied customers ( imagine someone not getting their favorite mithai!), and damage to your brand reputation.", "normalised": "Effective inventory forecasting helps companies like Tata Steel or Mahindra avoid both stockouts and overstocking.

{"unnormalised": "Implementing robust inventory forecasting processes allows companies to optimize their supply chain, reduce costs, and improve customer service. The cost benefits are significant: reducing carrying costs, minimizing obsolescence, and ensuring products are available when and where customers need them. This translates directly to improved profitability and a stronger competitive advantage, whether your company is supplying construction materials or manufacturing textiles. Rs. 10,000 saved in inventory costs is Rs. 10,000 added to the bottom line!", "normalised": "Implementing robust inventory forecasting processes allows companies to optimize their supply chain, reduce costs, and improve customer service.
