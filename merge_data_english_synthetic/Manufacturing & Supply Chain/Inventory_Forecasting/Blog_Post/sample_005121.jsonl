{"unnormalised": "Why is this important? Well, accurate forecasting helps optimize inventory levels, minimizing holding costs (Rs. on storage, insurance for that 5000 sq ft warehouse) and reducing the risk of stockouts. It allows businesses to make informed decisions about production planning, resource allocation, and even pricing strategies. Think of it like this: Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi uses forecasting models to predict the demand for seats in engineering courses. A similar approach applies to manufacturing!", "normalised": "Why is this important?

{"unnormalised": "Several methods exist for inventory forecasting. Simple moving averages are easy to implement but might not capture seasonality. Time series analysis, using historical data, is more sophisticated. Causal models consider external factors like economic indicators or even festival dates. For example, demand for firecrackers in Sivakasi spikes before Deepavali. Sophisticated AI algorithms are also becoming increasingly popular, leveraging machine learning to predict demand with higher accuracy.", "normalised": "Several methods exist for inventory forecasting.

{"unnormalised": "For smaller businesses in places like Coimbatore, managing inventory manually might seem sufficient initially. However, as they grow, investing in forecasting tools becomes essential. Failing to forecast accurately can lead to delayed deliveries, dissatisfied customers, and ultimately, lost revenue. Imagine a textile factory unable to fulfill a large order from Bangalore because they didn't anticipate the demand.", "normalised": "For smaller businesses in places like Coimbatore, managing inventory manually might seem sufficient initially.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the goal is to strike a balance between having enough inventory to meet customer demand and minimizing the costs associated with holding excess stock. It's a continuous process of data collection, analysis, and refinement. A good forecast ensures that products are available at the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantity, ensuring customer satisfaction and boosting profits.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the goal is to strike a balance between having enough inventory to meet customer demand and minimizing the costs associated with holding excess stock.
