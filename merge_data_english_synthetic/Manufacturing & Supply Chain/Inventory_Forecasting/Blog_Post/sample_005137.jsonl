{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is the process of predicting future demand for products. In the context of Indian manufacturing and supply chains, getting this right can be the difference between booming profits and crippling losses. Imagine a textile mill in Surat gearing up for Diwali. Accurately forecasting the demand for specific sari designs is vital. Too much stock and you're stuck with outdated patterns after the festival, leading to hefty discounts. Too little, and you miss out on potential revenue, leaving customers like Lakshmi disappointed.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is the process of predicting future demand for products.

{"unnormalised": "Effective forecasting utilizes various methods. Qualitative methods rely on expert opinions, like consulting with seasoned distributors in Chandni Chowk who have a \"feel\" for the market. Quantitative methods, on the other hand, leverage historical data. For example, analyzing sales data from the last 5 years to predict demand for the upcoming mango season, crucial for juice manufacturers in Nagpur. We use concepts of time series analysis taught at IIM Ahmedabad.", "normalised": "Effective forecasting utilizes various methods.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence the accuracy of forecasts. These include seasonal variations (like the monsoon affecting construction material demand), economic conditions (a rise in inflation impacting consumer spending), and competitor actions (a new player entering the market with a similar product). Failing to account for these nuances leads to inaccurate predictions. Dr. Sharma at IIT Delhi has published research showcasing the impact of GST implementation on inventory levels.", "normalised": "Several factors influence the accuracy of forecasts.

{"unnormalised": "Implementing a robust forecasting system brings several benefits. It minimizes stockouts, ensuring customer satisfaction. It reduces carrying costs associated with excess inventory – imagine the warehouse rent (Rs. 50,000 per month for 2000 sq ft) saved by optimizing stock levels. It also optimizes production schedules, ensuring efficient use of resources.", "normalised": "Implementing a robust forecasting system brings several benefits.
