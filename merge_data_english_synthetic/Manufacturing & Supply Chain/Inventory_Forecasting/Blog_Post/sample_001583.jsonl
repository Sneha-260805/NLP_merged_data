{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic world of manufacturing and supply chains, getting inventory right is crucial. Too much stock ties up capital, leads to storage costs, and even obsolescence. Too little and you risk stockouts, lost sales, and disgruntled customers. This is where inventory forecasting comes in – your crystal ball for predicting future demand.", "normalised": "In the dynamic world of manufacturing and supply chains, getting inventory right is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence inventory needs. For instance, seasonal demand like Diwali sweets or Holi colours will require careful planning. Consider the impact of promotions – a \"Buy One Get One Free\" offer on Amul butter at Reliance Fresh will obviously spike demand. Lead times are also critical; if it takes 6 weeks to ship raw materials from China to your factory near Surat, you need to forecast that far in advance.", "normalised": "Several factors influence inventory needs.

{"unnormalised": "Let's say Rajesh Kumar's textile factory in Ludhiana needs to forecast cotton yarn demand. He analyzes the past year's sales, noting a significant increase during the wedding season (November-February). He also considers market reports predicting a 15% growth in the Indian garment industry. By using exponential smoothing and incorporating these insights, Rajesh can estimate how much yarn he'll need to order, ensuring he can meet demand without overstocking his 5000 sq ft warehouse.", "normalised": "Let us say Rajesh Kumar's textile factory in Ludhiana needs to forecast cotton yarn demand.

Software tools can automate much of the process and provide valuable insights. The cost of these tools can range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5,00,000, depending on the features and complexity. Ultimately, effective inventory forecasting empowers you to optimize your supply chain, reduce costs, and ensure customer satisfaction. Ignoring it is like trying to navigate the Mumbai traffic without Google Maps – possible, but certainly not recommended!", "normalised": "Accurate forecasting is not a one-time exercise.
