{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting. It sounds like gazing into a crystal ball, hoping to predict the future. But in reality, it's a vital process for Indian manufacturers looking to optimize their supply chain and boost profitability. Accurate forecasting prevents stockouts that disappoint customers like Mrs. Sharma needing that saree for Diwali, and it avoids overstocking, tying up valuable capital in unsold goods like Mr. Verma’s seasonal kites after Makar Sankranti.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting.

Time series analysis, using techniques like moving averages or exponential smoothing, helps identify trends in past sales data, such as the steady increase in demand for organic cotton clothing from Tirupur over the last 5 years. We also use regression analysis, which explores the relationship between sales and other factors like advertising spend (Rs. 50,000 on a recent radio campaign) or economic indicators.", "normalised": "**Quantitative Forecasting:** This relies on historical data.
