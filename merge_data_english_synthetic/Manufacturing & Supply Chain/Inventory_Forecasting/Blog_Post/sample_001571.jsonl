If he overestimates demand for his festive kurtas, he's left with excess stock occupying valuable warehouse space (think 500 sq ft) and tying up capital. If he underestimates, he faces stockouts, lost sales to competitors like Reliance Trends, and unhappy customers.", "normalised": "Why is it so important?
