{"unnormalised": "In the competitive world of manufacturing and supply chain, accurately predicting future demand is crucial. This is where inventory forecasting comes in. It’s not about gazing into a crystal ball; instead, it uses historical data, market trends, and even a bit of good ol' Indian intuition (think back to your grandmother accurately predicting the mango harvest!) to estimate how much inventory you’ll need.", "normalised": "In the competitive world of manufacturing and supply chain, accurately predicting future demand is crucial.
