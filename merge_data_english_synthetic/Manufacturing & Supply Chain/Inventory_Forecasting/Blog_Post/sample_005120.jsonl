{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is like gazing into a crystal ball for manufacturers and suppliers. It’s the art and science of predicting how much of each product – from nuts and bolts to fully assembled tractors – you'll need, and when you’ll need it. Accurate forecasting can be the difference between a thriving business like Tata Steel and a struggling one.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is like gazing into a crystal ball for manufacturers and suppliers.

If you underestimate demand for your new silk saree design during the Diwali season, you’ll face stockouts, disappointed customers like Mrs. Sharma, and lost revenue. Overestimate, and you're stuck with excess inventory taking up valuable warehouse space (think thousands of sq ft) and tying up capital.", "normalised": "Why is this so critical?

{"unnormalised": "Several forecasting methods are used. One simple method is looking at historical data - for instance, sales figures from the last 5 years during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival to predict this year's demand. More complex methods involve statistical models considering factors like economic trends, competitor activity, and marketing campaigns. Dr. Patel from IIM Ahmedabad advocates for integrating machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy, especially when dealing with diverse product lines.", "normalised": "Several forecasting methods are used.

Unexpected events, like a sudden hike in gold prices impacting jewelry sales (priced in Rs./gram), can throw off even the most sophisticated models.", "normalised": "Consider factors unique to the Indian market.

{"unnormalised": "Implementing a robust inventory forecasting system requires careful planning and investment in software. But the return on investment is substantial, leading to optimized inventory levels, reduced waste, and improved customer satisfaction. It ultimately strengthens your entire supply chain, making it more resilient and responsive to the dynamic Indian market landscape.", "normalised": "Implementing a robust inventory forecasting system requires careful planning and investment in software.
