{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is the art and science of predicting future demand for products. For manufacturers in India, particularly those operating in diverse markets from Kolkata to Kochi, accurate forecasting is critical for optimizing production, minimizing costs, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Imagine Mrs. Sharma’s textile factory in Surat, struggling to meet a sudden surge in demand for festive sarees during Diwali! Proper forecasting could have prevented this stockout and lost revenue.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is the art and science of predicting future demand for products.

{"unnormalised": "Why is inventory forecasting so important? First, it allows manufacturers to plan production schedules effectively. Knowing what quantities of raw materials like cotton (Rs. 150/kg) and dyes are needed ensures smooth operations and prevents delays. Second, it minimizes holding costs. Unnecessary inventory ties up valuable capital and consumes precious warehouse space, which can be a significant expense, especially in congested industrial areas like Navi Mumbai where warehouse rentals can be Rs. 50 per sq ft.", "normalised": "Why is inventory forecasting so important?

{"unnormalised": "Several methods exist for inventory forecasting. Naive forecasting, simply assuming next month's demand will equal this month's, is a basic starting point. Moving averages and exponential smoothing consider historical data to identify trends. More advanced techniques, like regression analysis and time series analysis, leverage statistical models to identify correlations and patterns, but require skilled professionals like Dr. Khan from IIT Madras and specialized software.", "normalised": "Several methods exist for inventory forecasting.
