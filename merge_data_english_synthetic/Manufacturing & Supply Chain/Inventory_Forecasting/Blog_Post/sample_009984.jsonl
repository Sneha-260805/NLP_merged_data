{"unnormalised": "Inventory. It’s the lifeblood of any manufacturing business, like the Ganga for India. Too little, and you face stockouts, lost sales, and disappointed customers like Rohan who couldn’t get his Diwali mithai on time. Too much, and your warehouse is overflowing, tying up capital like cement in a construction project, incurring storage costs (think Rs. 50 per sq ft per month in Mumbai) and risking obsolescence. That’s where inventory forecasting comes in.", "normalised": "Inventory. It's the lifeblood of any manufacturing business, like the Ganga for India.

{"unnormalised": "Inventory forecasting is essentially predicting future demand for your products. It’s like Dr. Sharma from IIM-Ahmedabad using statistical models to predict the monsoon - not perfect, but significantly better than guessing. We use historical data, market trends, and even consider seasonal factors like the demand for rakhis during Raksha Bandhan to estimate future needs.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting is essentially predicting future demand for your products.

Accurate forecasting allows them to procure the right amount of raw materials (silk, zari) well in advance, negotiate better prices with suppliers, and plan production schedules effectively. It also helps optimize warehouse space and reduce wastage.", "normalised": "Why is this so critical? Imagine a textile manufacturer in Surat producing sarees.

{"unnormalised": "There are several forecasting methods, from simple moving averages to sophisticated statistical models incorporating external factors like inflation and competitor actions. ERP systems often have built-in forecasting tools. A popular software uses sophisticated algorithms to predict demand based on past sales data and promotional activities.", "normalised": "There are several forecasting methods, from simple moving averages to sophisticated statistical models incorporating external factors like inflation and competitor actions.

{"unnormalised": "Effective forecasting can significantly improve your ROI. It's not about being perfect, it's about minimizing errors and making informed decisions. Consider factors like lead times (e.g., 30 days for imported components from China), production capacity, and potential disruptions (e.g., strikes in industrial areas).", "normalised": "Effective forecasting can significantly improve your R O I.
