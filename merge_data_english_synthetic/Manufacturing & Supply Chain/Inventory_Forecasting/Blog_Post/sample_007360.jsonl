Get it wrong, and you're dealing with floods of unsold goods or, worse, crippling shortages that can shut down your production line. For manufacturers across India, accurate inventory forecasting is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity.", "normalised": "Inventory forecasting – it is like predicting the monsoon in Mumbai.

{"unnormalised": "What exactly *is* inventory forecasting? Simply put, it's the art and science of predicting future demand for your products. This allows you to determine how much raw material you need to order, how much to manufacture, and where to store it – whether that's in your own 10,000 sq ft warehouse in Faridabad or at a 3PL partner.", "normalised": "What exactly *is* inventory forecasting?

{"unnormalised": "Several methods exist. Naive forecasting, assuming next month will be the same as this month, is simple but often unreliable. Moving averages, weighted averages, and exponential smoothing are slightly more sophisticated, using historical data to smooth out the fluctuations. For example, Mr. Sharma, the purchasing manager at Bharat Textiles in Surat, uses a weighted average to predict fabric demand, giving more weight to recent sales figures, especially around Diwali season.", "normalised": "Several methods exist.

Understocking leads to lost sales, production delays, and unhappy customers. Imagine a lag in raw materials delaying delivery of Mahindra tractors to farmers during sowing season.
