{"unnormalised": "In the competitive landscape of Indian manufacturing and supply chain, accurate inventory forecasting is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. Imagine Rajesh, a factory owner in Faridabad producing garments for export. He needs to predict fabric demand for the next quarter, considering upcoming festivals like Diwali which historically see a surge in orders. Without proper forecasting, Rajesh risks either stockouts, leading to lost sales and disgruntled customers (imagine missing a crucial delivery to his client in Germany!), or overstocking, tying up valuable capital and warehouse space – imagine stacks of unused silk occupying precious sq ft that could be used for new machinery.", "normalised": "In the competitive landscape of Indian manufacturing and supply chain, accurate inventory forecasting is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the magic sauce? Inventory forecasting uses historical data, market trends, and even external factors like the monsoon season impacting cotton crops, to predict future demand. Several methods exist. Simple moving averages are easy to implement, looking at past sales data – say, the last 6 months of kurta sales - to project future demand. More sophisticated techniques, like exponential smoothing and regression analysis, consider seasonal variations and correlations with other variables. Think about Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi consulting with Rajesh to implement a time series analysis, factoring in historical sales data, marketing campaigns, and competitor activity.", "normalised": "So, what’s the magic sauce?
