A sudden spike in demand for Kanjivaram silk sarees during the wedding season in Tamil Nadu could leave you scrambling. Or, a supplier in Rajasthan facing unforeseen monsoon delays could halt your entire production line. Accurate forecasting helps mitigate such risks.", "normalised": "Why is it so important, especially for manufacturers operating in a diverse market like India?

{"unnormalised": "Investing in proper inventory forecasting isn't just about avoiding shortages. It’s about optimizing your entire supply chain. It helps you reduce waste, improve cash flow, and ultimately, increase profitability. No manufacturer wants to be stuck with unsold stock, costing them Rs. 10 Lakh in storage fees! So, don’t underestimate the power of predicting the future. It's the key to a healthy and efficient manufacturing operation. And remember, even the best astrologer (or forecasting model) can sometimes be wrong, so always build in a buffer!", "normalised": "Investing in proper inventory forecasting isn't just about avoiding shortages.
