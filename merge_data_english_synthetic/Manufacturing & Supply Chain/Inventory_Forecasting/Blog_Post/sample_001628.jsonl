Overestimating, on the other hand, ties up capital in unsold inventory and increases storage costs. Space in the godown (warehouse), even a small one measuring just 500 sq ft, comes at a price.", "normalised": "Why is it so crucial? Imagine a saree manufacturer in Surat.

{"unnormalised": "Several methods exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Simple moving averages are easy to understand, but they don't account for seasonality or trends. More complex techniques, like exponential smoothing and ARIMA models, can handle these fluctuations. Consider the automotive industry in Chennai, where demand for certain car models spikes during the festive season (Dhanteras, for instance). These techniques can incorporate such seasonal factors.", "normalised": "Several methods exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
