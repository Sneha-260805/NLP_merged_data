The system predicts yarn demand with improved accuracy, minimizing overstocking and stockouts. This shift also frees up working capital, saving Rs. 5 Lakhs per month in carrying costs. The improved practices are expected to enhance the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing on the global stage.", "normalised": "For instance, a textile manufacturer in Surat, Gujarat, reported a fifteen percent reduction in storage space requirements (freeing up valuable five thousand square feet) after implementing a new forecasting model.
