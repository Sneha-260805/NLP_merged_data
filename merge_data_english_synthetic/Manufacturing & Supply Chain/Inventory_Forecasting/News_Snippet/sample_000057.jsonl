For example, a textile manufacturer in Surat using predictive models reported a 15% reduction in inventory holding costs and a 10% increase in order fulfillment rates. Efficient forecasting helps manage raw material procurement, reduce waste, and ultimately boost profitability. Rs. saved in inventory translates to increased competitiveness. Businesses are advised to invest in training and technological upgrades to improve their forecasting capabilities.", "normalised": "Poor forecasting can lead to overstocking, tying up valuable capital in unsold inventory that occupies thousands of feet of warehouse space, or understocking, causing production delays and lost sales.
