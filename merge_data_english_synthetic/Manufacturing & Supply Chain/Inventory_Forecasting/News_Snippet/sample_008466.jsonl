{"unnormalised": "Implementing robust forecasting systems can lead to significant savings, potentially reducing carrying costs by up to 20%. It also allows businesses to optimize warehouse space utilization, particularly important in densely populated areas like Mumbai where real estate is expensive (Rs. 500/sq ft for warehousing). Supply chain resilience, crucial given recent global disruptions, is further strengthened. A proper system ensures companies have the right materials, at the right place, at the right time.", "normalised": "implementing robust forecasting systems can lead to significant savings potentially reducing carrying costs by up to twenty percent it also allows businesses to optimize warehouse space utilization particularly important in densely populated areas like mumbai where real estate is expensive rupee five hundred per square foot for warehousing supply chain resilience crucial given recent global disruptions is further strengthened a proper system ensures companies have the right materials at the right place at the right time"}
