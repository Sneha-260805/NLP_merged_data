A dairy company in Punjab, for example, uses real-time data to predict milk demand and adjust production accordingly, saving Rs. 50,000 daily. Companies are increasingly investing in warehouse management systems (WMS) and advanced analytics tools to improve forecasting accuracy. Proper planning also helps in better utilization of storage spaces, optimizing usage in godowns spanning thousands of sq ft. This focus on predictive analytics is paving the way for a more resilient and cost-effective manufacturing sector in India.", "normalised": "Effective inventory forecasting also minimizes wastage, particularly important for perishable goods.
