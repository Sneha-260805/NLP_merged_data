Conversely, excess inventory ties up capital, incurring storage costs and risking obsolescence in sectors like consumer electronics. A leading textile mill in Surat, for example, reported saving Rs. 50 Lakhs annually by optimizing warehouse space utilization from 10,000 sq ft to 8,000 sq ft through better forecasting. Advanced algorithms, like those incorporating ARIMA models, help companies optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and improve cash flow, leading to a more resilient supply chain.", "normalised": "Poor forecasting leads to stockouts, lost sales, and delayed deliveries – impacting reputations, especially for firms supplying to large retailers like Reliance Retail.
