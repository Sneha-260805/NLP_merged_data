{"unnormalised": "Inefficient forecasting can lead to stockouts, causing production delays and lost sales, ultimately impacting profitability. Businesses operating in areas with fluctuating transport costs, like the Northeast, will find that robust inventory models are a lifesaver. Moreover, optimal inventory management saves on warehouse space (measured in sq ft) and reduces holding costs (often quantified in Rs.), benefitting overall operational efficiency. Proper planning ensures seamless operations from raw material procurement to finished product delivery. Ignoring it can create havoc!", "normalised": "Inefficient forecasting can lead to stockouts, causing production delays and lost sales, ultimately impacting profitability.
