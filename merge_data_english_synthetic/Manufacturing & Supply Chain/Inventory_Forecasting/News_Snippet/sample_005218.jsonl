Predictive algorithms help determine optimal stock levels for raw materials and finished goods, reducing storage costs (Rs. 10 per sq ft in some industrial areas). Companies like Tata Steel are investing heavily in AI-powered forecasting tools to improve efficiency and reduce lead times, ensuring they can meet customer demand without overstocking. This approach minimizes the risk of obsolescence and prevents bottlenecks across the supply chain.", "normalised": "The process involves analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and even factors like festival seasons (Diwali, Eid) to anticipate future needs.
