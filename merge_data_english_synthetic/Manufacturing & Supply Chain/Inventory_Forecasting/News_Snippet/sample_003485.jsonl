These solutions analyze historical sales data, market trends, and even social media sentiment to forecast future needs. A recent report suggests that effective inventory forecasting could reduce holding costs by up to 15% for manufacturers by Q1 2025. This aligns with the government's \"Make in India\" initiative, promoting efficient and competitive local production. Early data from pilot programs suggest significant improvements are already being realized, with some companies reporting a 12% reduction in stockouts since implementing new systems on 01/07/2024.", "normalised": "Several companies, including Mumbai-based textile giant, Birla Fabrics, are investing in A I-powered solutions to predict demand more accurately.
