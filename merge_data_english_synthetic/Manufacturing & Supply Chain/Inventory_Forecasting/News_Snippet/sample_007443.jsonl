{"unnormalised": "Modern forecasting methods leverage data analytics and machine learning to predict future demand with greater precision. This helps companies reduce stockouts, minimize holding costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Furthermore, optimized inventory management contributes to a more efficient supply chain, benefiting businesses across the country, from small-scale artisans in Rajasthan to large industrial conglomerates in Chennai. Implementing these systems requires investment, but the long-term ROI can be substantial. Experts suggest starting with easily implementable techniques before incorporating complex algorithms.", "normalised": "Modern forecasting methods leverage data analytics and machine learning to predict future demand with greater precision.
