Companies like Tata Steel are reportedly implementing machine learning models to anticipate fluctuations, aiming for a 15% reduction in inventory holding by 2024. Poor forecasting can lead to losses, with perishable goods like vegetables produced in Nashik going to waste if demand isn't accurately predicted. The next national workshop on \"Supply Chain Optimization\" is scheduled for November 10, 2023, at IIM Ahmedabad. Farmers markets often overstock at 07:00 AM on Sundays due to reliance on basic forecasting leading to substantial waste.", "normalised": "Traditional methods often rely on historical data, but newer techniques incorporate external factors like monsoon patterns affecting crop yields (relevant for agro-based industries) and festival seasons like Diwali impacting consumer demand.
