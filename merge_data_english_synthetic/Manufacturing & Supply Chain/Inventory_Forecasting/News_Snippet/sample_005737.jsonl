{"unnormalised": "Modern techniques incorporate AI and machine learning to predict demand more effectively. This allows businesses to proactively manage warehouse space (measured in sq ft), reduce waste, and ensure timely delivery to distributors in places like Guwahati and Kochi. Improved forecasting also strengthens relationships with suppliers, ensuring a steady flow of raw materials to meet production targets. This reduces lead times and ultimately benefits the end consumer. For instance, better forecasting prevents shortages of mithai ingredients during festival season, ensuring everyone gets their favorite sweets.", "normalised": "Modern techniques incorporate A I and machine learning to predict demand more effectively.
