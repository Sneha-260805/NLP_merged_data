Implementing a robust system can lead to significant savings, potentially reducing inventory holding costs by up to 15%.", "normalised": "By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and even weather patterns (particularly crucial for agricultural supply chains in states like Punjab), businesses can predict future needs with greater precision.

{"unnormalised": "This is particularly important for SMEs operating in crowded marketplaces. A small garment factory in Tirupur, for example, can use forecasting to ensure they have the right fabrics in stock without tying up too much capital in a 10,000 sq ft warehouse. Modern tools now offer features like real-time data integration and AI-powered analysis, allowing even smaller businesses access to advanced forecasting capabilities previously only available to larger corporations. With efficient inventory management, even mom-and-pop shops can better compete, and hopefully avoid accumulating Rs. 5 Lakhs worth of unsold stock.", "normalised": "This is particularly important for S M Es operating in crowded marketplaces.
