Conversely, a well-managed inventory system reduces wastage and frees up capital. Smart forecasting allows companies to navigate logistical challenges and offer competitive pricing, boosting profitability. Improved inventory turnover helps reduce obsolescence of seasonal goods like woolen clothes in Srinagar. Rs. 50 crore investment in forecasting software can lead to significant returns for large manufacturers.", "normalised": "Poor forecasting can lead to significant losses – imagine a factory with fifty thousand square feet of unused space filled with unsold stock.
