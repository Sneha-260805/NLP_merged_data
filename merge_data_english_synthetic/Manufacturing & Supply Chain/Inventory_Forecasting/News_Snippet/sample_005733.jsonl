{"unnormalised": "Improved forecasting translates to less wasted space – consider saving 5000 sq ft of warehouse space per factory! It also reduces financial strain, as lower inventory means fewer Rs. blocked in unsold goods. Experts predict that better inventory management will boost the Indian manufacturing sector's efficiency by at least 15% in the next 5 years. Further research indicates a potential for 20% reduction in transportation costs related to excess inventory.", "normalised": "Improved forecasting translates to less wasted space – consider saving five thousand square feet of warehouse space per factory!
