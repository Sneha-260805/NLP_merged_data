{"unnormalised": "This data helps companies predict demand for everything from raw materials like steel and cotton to finished goods. For example, a textile mill in Surat can use forecasts to determine the optimal amount of yarn to order, reducing the need for expensive warehousing space (Rs. 50/sq ft). Effective inventory forecasting translates to significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency, strengthening India's manufacturing sector. Investing in such systems is becoming vital for competing globally.", "normalised": "This data helps companies predict demand for everything from raw materials like steel and cotton to finished goods.
