{"unnormalised": "Effective forecasting considers factors like seasonality (Diwali, Pongal), promotions, and economic indicators. Smaller units often struggle with this, lacking the sophisticated tools used by larger firms. For example, a small garment factory occupying 1000 sq ft needs to forecast inventory better to avoid tying up working capital. Better forecasting ultimately translates into improved profitability and responsiveness to customer needs, a critical advantage given fluctuating Rs. values.", "normalised": "Effective forecasting considers factors like seasonality (Diwali, Pongal), promotions, and economic indicators.
