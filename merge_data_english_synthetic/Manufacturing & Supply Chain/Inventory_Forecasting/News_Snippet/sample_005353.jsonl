The shift is driven by rising operational costs and the need to meet fluctuating demand, especially during peak seasons like Diwali and Onam. Leading institutions like I I T Madras are partnering with industry giants to develop A I-powered forecasting models tailored to the Indian market. These models consider factors like regional consumer preferences, the impact of festivals (demand for ingredients for biryani traditionally spikes!), and unpredictable weather patterns that can disrupt logistics. \"Accurate forecasting is no longer a luxury, but a necessity,\" says Mister Sharma, C E O of a prominent automotive component manufacturer in Pune. \"We've seen a fifteen percent reduction in inventory holding costs after implementing a new forecasting system.\" Experts predict further adoption of these technologies as companies strive for leaner and more responsive supply chains to compete globally. Investment in robust forecasting solutions is expected to increase by rupee five hundred crore over the next three years."}
