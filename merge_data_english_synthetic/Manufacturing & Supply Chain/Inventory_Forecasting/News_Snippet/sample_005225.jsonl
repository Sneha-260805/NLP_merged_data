A recent study revealed that manufacturers using advanced forecasting models saw a reduction of up to 15% in holding costs per sq ft of warehouse space. This translates to significant savings, sometimes in the millions of Rs., and improves cash flow. Implementing robust inventory forecasting is no longer a luxury but a necessity for survival and growth in today’s competitive landscape. Ignoring it can lead to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.", "normalised": "Companies are increasingly adopting software solutions that incorporate real-time sales data and market trends.
