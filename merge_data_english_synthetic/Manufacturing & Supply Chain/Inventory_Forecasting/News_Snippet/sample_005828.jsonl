A recent study by FICCI revealed that companies with robust forecasting capabilities experience a 15% reduction in warehousing costs, freeing up capital for expansion and R&D. This translates into potentially Rs. 50 lakh saved per year for a medium-sized enterprise operating a 10,000 sq ft warehouse. Investing in sophisticated forecasting tools is no longer a luxury but a necessity for Indian manufacturers looking to stay competitive.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, including accounting for regional festivals like Diwali and Holi, which significantly impact consumer demand.
