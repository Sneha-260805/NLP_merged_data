{"unnormalised": "The delays are attributed to factors including infrastructure constraints, bureaucratic red tape, and a shortage of skilled manpower. The Ministry of Commerce is reportedly considering measures to streamline processes and invest in infrastructure upgrades, targeting a reduction of logistics costs from the current 14% of GDP to under 10% in the next 3 years. Further analysis suggests railway bottlenecks contribute to the delay by at least 250 km. Urgent solutions are needed to keep India's manufacturing engine humming.", "normalised": "The delays are attributed to factors including infrastructure constraints, bureaucratic red tape, and a shortage of skilled manpower.
