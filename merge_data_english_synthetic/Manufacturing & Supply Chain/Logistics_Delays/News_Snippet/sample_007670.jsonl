Further, delays at inter-state checkposts add to the frustration. This is leading to increased inventory holding costs for manufacturers by almost Rs. 20,000 per consignment, impacting their profit margins. Experts are urging the government to accelerate infrastructure development and streamline customs procedures to alleviate these pressures. The situation threatens to derail the country's ambition of becoming a manufacturing powerhouse.", "normalised": "The report highlights inadequate infrastructure and bureaucratic red tape as key contributors.
