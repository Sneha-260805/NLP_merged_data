{"unnormalised": "The report highlights that smaller manufacturers in industrial clusters like Chakan and Sanand, often operating in rented spaces of 5,000-10,000 sq ft, are disproportionately affected due to limited warehousing capacity. Increased fuel costs are also exacerbating the problem, with transportation expenses rising by approximately 15%. This translates to higher prices for consumers and reduced profits for businesses. Manufacturers are urging the government to expedite infrastructure projects and streamline customs procedures to alleviate the pressure. The delays also impact the timely delivery of goods for the upcoming Diwali season, potentially affecting sales. The resultant cost escalations are estimated to be in the range of Rs. 50-100 crore for affected industries.", "normalised": "The report highlights that smaller manufacturers in industrial clusters like Chakan and Sanand, often operating in rented spaces of five thousand to ten thousand square feet, are disproportionately affected due to limited warehousing capacity.
