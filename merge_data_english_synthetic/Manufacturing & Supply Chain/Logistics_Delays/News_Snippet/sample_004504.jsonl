Several manufacturers report delays of up to 2 weeks in receiving raw materials. This is leading to production slowdowns and increased operational costs, estimated in some cases to be as high as Rs. 50 lakhs per day for larger factories.", "normalised": "\"The delays are particularly acute for businesses reliant on just in time inventory management,\" Doctor Sharma stated.

Reports indicate that even temporary storage solutions are commanding premium rates, with rentals for even 10,000 sq ft warehouses seeing a surge. The delays are also impacting export orders, potentially damaging India's reputation as a reliable supplier. The government is reportedly considering measures to streamline port operations and improve road infrastructure to address the crisis.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the scarcity of warehousing space, particularly in key industrial hubs, is exacerbating the problem.
