{"unnormalised": "Experts at the Indian Institute of Logistics (IIL) attribute the issues to a confluence of factors including increased festive season demand, inadequate infrastructure in some regions, and a shortage of truck drivers post-monsoon. The average transit time for goods traveling over 500 km has increased by nearly 2 days, impacting production schedules and potentially leading to unfilled orders. Reports suggest that companies are exploring alternative transportation methods, including railways and coastal shipping, to mitigate the disruption. The situation is expected to persist for at least the next 2-3 weeks.", "normalised": "Experts at the Indian Institute of Logistics (I I L) attribute the issues to a confluence of factors including increased festive season demand, inadequate infrastructure in some regions, and a shortage of truck drivers post-monsoon.
