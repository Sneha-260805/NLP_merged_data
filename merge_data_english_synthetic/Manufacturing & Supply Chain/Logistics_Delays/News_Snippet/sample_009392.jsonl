Delays of even a few days can halt production lines,” explains Ms. Patel, CEO of a large automotive component manufacturer in Chennai. She further added that warehousing costs have also increased due to the need for larger inventory to buffer against these unpredictable delays. A new cold storage facility spanning 50,000 sq ft near Ahmedabad remains partially unused due to the uncertainty around shipment schedules. The industry estimates that addressing these logistics challenges could save manufacturers several Rs. crores annually and significantly boost exports. The Government is currently considering proposals to improve infrastructure, including the construction of new freight corridors spanning over 2,000 km.", "normalised": "“Timely delivery of raw materials, especially components sourced from international markets, is crucial.
