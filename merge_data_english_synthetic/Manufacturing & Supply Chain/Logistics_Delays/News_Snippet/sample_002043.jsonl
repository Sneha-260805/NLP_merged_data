Approximately 600 km routes are experiencing delays of 2-3 days on average, impacting just-in-time manufacturing processes. Exporters are also facing challenges, with containers stuck at ports like JNPT for extended periods, harming India's image as a reliable supplier. The government is urged to expedite infrastructure development and streamline customs procedures to address these critical issues. Further delays will damage future economic growth.", "normalised": "“These delays add significant time and rupees five to ten per unit in production costs, impacting competitiveness,” says Doctor Sharma, head of the I I L study.
