{"unnormalised": "We've all seen the headlines. A shipment of crucial electronic components, originating from Chennai and destined for a TV manufacturing unit in Noida, held up due to unforeseen road closures after the monsoon. Or a consignment of raw materials, vital for the production of sarees in Kanchipuram, delayed because of a railway track maintenance near Vijayawada. The cost? Not just Rs. in lost production, but also damage to brand reputation.", "normalised": "We've all seen the headlines.

{"unnormalised": "What are the key drivers of these delays? Several factors contribute. Infrastructure limitations, particularly inadequate road networks and congested ports, are significant hurdles. The sheer volume of goods moving across the country, coupled with bureaucratic red tape, often leads to gridlock. Weather patterns, like the unpredictable monsoons or the intense heat waves in Rajasthan, can also disrupt transportation schedules.", "normalised": "What are the key drivers of these delays?

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma from IIM Bangalore suggests a multi-pronged approach, focusing on improving warehouse infrastructure (think modern, temperature-controlled facilities of at least 10,000 sq ft), investing in skilled labor, and fostering closer collaboration between manufacturers, logistics providers, and government agencies. Ultimately, overcoming logistics delays requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders to build a more robust and resilient supply chain. And that's crucial to keeping \"Make in India\" truly competitive.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma from I I M Bangalore suggests a multi-pronged approach, focusing on improving warehouse infrastructure (think modern, temperature-controlled facilities of at least ten thousand square feet), investing in skilled labor, and fostering closer collaboration between manufacturers, logistics providers, and government agencies.
