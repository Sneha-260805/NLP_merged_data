{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in road and rail networks, remain a major challenge. A truck stuck for hours near the Delhi-Gurgaon border due to congestion is a common sight. The average speed of freight trains is a paltry 25 kmph, hindering timely delivery.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, bureaucratic hurdles and complex documentation processes add to the delay. A single shipment often requires multiple clearances from different government agencies, leading to unnecessary delays and paperwork. For instance, obtaining all necessary permits for transporting goods from a manufacturing unit in Rajasthan to a distribution center in Chennai can take weeks.", "normalised": "Moreover, bureaucratic hurdles and complex documentation processes add to the delay.

{"unnormalised": "The impact on businesses is substantial. Increased holding costs due to delayed shipments can eat into profit margins. Dr. Sharma at IIT Madras, who researches supply chain optimization, estimates that logistics delays add an average of 10-15% to the cost of goods sold. For businesses operating on tight margins, this can be crippling. Even for a large company like Reliance Industries, delays can impact production timelines and overall efficiency.", "normalised": "The impact on businesses is substantial. Increased holding costs due to delayed shipments can eat into profit margins. Doctor Sharma at I I T Madras, who researches supply chain optimization, estimates that logistics delays add an average of ten to fifteen percent to the cost of goods sold.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, unpredictable delays disrupt production schedules. Imagine a garment factory in Tirupur awaiting delivery of fabric from Surat. If the fabric is delayed, the entire production line grinds to a halt, leading to idle workers and missed deadlines. The cost? Lost revenue and potential damage to reputation. Storage space becomes another problem. A godown of 5000 sq ft sits idle waiting for components.", "normalised": "Furthermore, unpredictable delays disrupt production schedules.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach. Investment in infrastructure, streamlining of regulatory processes, and adoption of technology are crucial. The government’s initiatives like the National Logistics Policy are a step in the right direction, aiming to reduce logistics costs and improve efficiency. Ultimately, a seamless and efficient supply chain is vital for India to achieve its manufacturing potential and compete effectively in the global marketplace. Rs. 50,000 is often paid in \"speed money\" to avoid these delays.", "normalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach.
