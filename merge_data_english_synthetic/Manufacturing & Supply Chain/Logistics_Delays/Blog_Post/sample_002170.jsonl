{"unnormalised": "Frankly, the impact is significant. Delayed shipments of raw materials can halt production lines. Imagine a delay of even 2 days on a shipment of steel from Jamshedpur to a fabrication unit in Pune. That's potentially Rs. 5 Lakhs in lost revenue and missed deadlines.", "normalised": "Frankly, the impact is significant. Delayed shipments of raw materials can halt production lines.

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest culprits is infrastructure. Poor road connectivity, especially in rural areas, translates to longer transit times. We're talking about trucks crawling at 20 kmph instead of the 60-80 kmph they should be doing. This, coupled with bureaucratic red tape at state borders, adds days to delivery schedules. Remember the truck stuck at the Delhi-Haryana border in that famous scene from \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\"? It's funny on screen, not so much in real life when it’s your components.", "normalised": "One of the biggest culprits is infrastructure.

According to a recent study by IIM Ahmedabad, Indian companies hold approximately 30% more inventory than their global counterparts, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding delivery times. This ties up capital and increases storage costs.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inefficient warehousing and inventory management contribute heavily.

{"unnormalised": "What's the solution? Investment in infrastructure is paramount. Better roads, improved port efficiency (looking at you, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust!), and streamlined customs procedures are crucial. Furthermore, embracing technology like real-time tracking and predictive analytics can help businesses anticipate and mitigate potential delays. Finally, cultivating a culture of proactive communication and collaboration between suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers is essential to keep things moving smoothly. It’s time to move beyond “chalta hai” and embrace efficiency if we want to compete globally.", "normalised": "What's the solution? Investment in infrastructure is paramount.
