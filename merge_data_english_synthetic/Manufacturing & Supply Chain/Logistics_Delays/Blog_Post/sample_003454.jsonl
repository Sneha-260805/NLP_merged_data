{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic world of manufacturing and supply chain, logistics delays are as common as chai breaks. From raw material procurement in Tamil Nadu to delivering finished goods to a retailer in Delhi, the journey is fraught with potential bottlenecks. Understanding these delays is crucial for maintaining profitability and customer satisfaction, especially in a price-sensitive market like India.", "normalised": "In the dynamic world of manufacturing and supply chain, logistics delays are as common as chai breaks.

{"unnormalised": "Firstly, infrastructure limitations remain a significant hurdle. Potholed roads, congested ports like JNPT, and insufficient warehousing facilities contribute significantly. Imagine a consignment of fabric from Surat getting stuck due to road closures – that's Rs. worth of material delayed, impacting production schedules.", "normalised": "Firstly, infrastructure limitations remain a significant hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, documentation and customs clearance processes can be painfully slow. Dealing with multiple agencies, lengthy paperwork, and bureaucratic red tape often add days, sometimes weeks, to delivery timelines. A shipment held up at customs for 72 hrs is not uncommon, especially if there are discrepancies.", "normalised": "Secondly, documentation and customs clearance processes can be painfully slow.
