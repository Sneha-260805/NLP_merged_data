{"unnormalised": "Consider a small auto component manufacturer in Pune relying on raw material shipments from Kolkata. The usual 3-day transit time by road can easily stretch to 7 or even 10 days during heavy rains, impacting production schedules. This delay not only increases inventory holding costs (imagine the idle capital tied up!) but also risks jeopardizing delivery commitments to their OEM clients. We're talking potential penalties ranging from a few thousand Rs. to lakhs, depending on the contract.", "normalised": "Consider a small auto component manufacturer in Pune relying on raw material shipments from Kolkata.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these logistical logjams. Firstly, poorly maintained rural roads become impassable during the monsoon. Then there's the sheer volume of traffic, especially around major ports like Mumbai and Chennai, leading to bottlenecks and increased transit times. Customs clearances can also be a hurdle, sometimes adding an extra 24-48 hours to the process.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these logistical logjams.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, a shortage of skilled truck drivers exacerbates the problem. Many drivers are reluctant to navigate flooded roads, preferring to wait out the storm in safer locations. This further reduces the number of trucks available and drives up transportation costs. One client recently reported a 15% increase in freight charges just because of monsoon-related delays.", "normalised": "Furthermore, a shortage of skilled truck drivers exacerbates the problem.

{"unnormalised": "Mitigation strategies are crucial. Manufacturers need to diversify their sourcing options, build buffer stock where feasible, and invest in technology solutions for real-time tracking of shipments. Stronger relationships with logistics providers and proactive communication with customers are also key to weathering these seasonal storms. Just like Raj and Simran overcoming obstacles to reach their destination, resilience and smart planning are the keys to conquering the logistics challenges facing Indian manufacturing.", "normalised": "Mitigation strategies are crucial.
