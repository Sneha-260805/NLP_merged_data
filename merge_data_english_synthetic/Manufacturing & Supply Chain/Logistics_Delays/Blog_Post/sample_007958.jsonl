{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays are a persistent headache for manufacturers across India. From raw materials stuck at Mumbai port to finished goods languishing in warehouses near Kanpur, the ripple effects impact production schedules, inflate costs, and ultimately, dent profitability. It’s a problem that echoes the famous dialogue from the Bollywood film *Rang De Basanti*: \"Koi bhi desh perfect nahin hota, use perfect banana padta hai.\" (No country is perfect; it has to be made perfect). We need to actively address these delays to achieve true manufacturing excellence.", "normalised": "Logistics delays are a persistent headache for manufacturers across India.

The Golden Quadrilateral, while a significant achievement, still struggles with congestion, especially during peak seasons like Diwali. Imagine a consignment of silk sarees destined for Delhi retailers getting held up for 3 days near Jaipur because of traffic.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, bureaucratic hurdles and documentation complexities at state borders also contribute to delays. Trucks often get bogged down in octroi checks and paper work, adding significantly to transit times. A recent study by IIM Ahmedabad estimated that these delays alone add around Rs. 10,000 to the cost of each long-haul shipment.", "normalised": "Furthermore, bureaucratic hurdles and documentation complexities at state borders also contribute to delays.

{"unnormalised": "The lack of real-time tracking and visibility also plays a role. Knowing the precise location and status of a shipment in transit is crucial for proactive problem-solving. While some larger players are adopting sophisticated tracking systems, many smaller SMEs in places like Ludhiana and Coimbatore still rely on rudimentary methods.", "normalised": "The lack of real-time tracking and visibility also plays a role.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach. Investment in infrastructure, simplification of regulatory processes, and adoption of technology are all vital. We need initiatives to improve road networks, streamline customs procedures, and promote the adoption of digital logistics platforms. Only then can we truly unlock the full potential of India's manufacturing sector and move beyond the \"chalta hai\" attitude towards logistics. Every km saved, every hour gained, translates to increased efficiency and competitiveness for Indian businesses.", "normalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach.
