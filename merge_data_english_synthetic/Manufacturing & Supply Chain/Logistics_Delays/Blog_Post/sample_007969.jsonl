{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays are a persistent pain point in the Indian manufacturing landscape, and the \"chalta hai\" attitude towards deadlines is costing businesses dearly. From raw material procurement to finished goods distribution, holdups at every stage of the supply chain erode profit margins and damage customer relationships.", "normalised": "Logistics delays are a persistent pain point in the Indian manufacturing landscape, and the \"it will do\" attitude towards deadlines is costing businesses dearly.

{"unnormalised": "Consider a textile manufacturer in Surat relying on cotton sourced from farms in Maharashtra. If the truck carrying the cotton gets stuck for days due to bad roads near Nashik or unforeseen delays at a state border crossing – a common occurrence even with GST – the entire production schedule gets thrown off. This impacts the factory’s ability to fulfil orders on time, potentially leading to penalties and a tarnished reputation. We’ve seen even established players like Tata Steel face significant challenges navigating these logistical hurdles.", "normalised": "Consider a textile manufacturer in Surat relying on cotton sourced from farms in Maharashtra.

Many SMEs still rely on manual processes and phone calls to monitor their shipments, creating information gaps that exacerbate delays. Remember the chaos depicted in \"Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year\"? He tackled a similar problem with innovative solutions. We need similar ingenuity in logistics.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the lack of real-time tracking and visibility contributes to the problem.

{"unnormalised": "The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that logistics costs account for roughly 13-14% of India’s GDP, significantly higher than the global average. A substantial portion of this expense is attributed to inefficiencies and delays. Upgrading infrastructure, streamlining customs procedures, and investing in technology are crucial steps towards mitigating these challenges. Investing in better roads connecting industrial hubs like Chennai and Coimbatore, for instance, can significantly reduce transit times and improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain. Addressing these delays is not just about cost-cutting; it's about enhancing India's competitiveness in the global market.
