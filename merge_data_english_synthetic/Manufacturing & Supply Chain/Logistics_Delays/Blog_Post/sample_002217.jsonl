{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays are an enduring pain point for manufacturers across India, impacting profitability and creating ripple effects throughout the supply chain. From raw material procurement to finished goods distribution, hold-ups translate to missed deadlines, increased costs, and frustrated customers. Think of it like the traffic jam in that famous scene from \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" – everything grinds to a halt, no matter how well you planned.", "normalised": "Logistics delays are an enduring pain point for manufacturers across India, impacting profitability and creating ripple effects throughout the supply chain.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure bottlenecks are a significant issue. The Golden Quadrilateral highway network, while an improvement, still faces congestion, especially around major industrial hubs like Mumbai, Chennai, and Delhi. Ports, too, experience backlogs due to inefficiencies in customs clearance and cargo handling. We’ve seen delays of 3-5 days just waiting for customs clearance in JNPT sometimes.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure bottlenecks are a significant issue.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles and regulatory complexities add to the problem. Multiple approvals, lengthy documentation processes, and varying state-level regulations create unnecessary delays and increase administrative burdens. A study by IIM Ahmedabad highlighted that Indian businesses spend, on average, Rs. 15,000 extra per shipment due to such inefficiencies.", "normalised": "Beyond infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles and regulatory complexities add to the problem.

{"unnormalised": "What can be done? Improved infrastructure investment, streamlined regulatory processes, and greater adoption of technology, such as real-time tracking and predictive analytics, are crucial. For example, companies can leverage AI to anticipate potential disruptions based on weather patterns and news reports, allowing for proactive adjustments to their logistics plans. Strengthening the cold chain infrastructure for perishable goods is also paramount. The government's focus on developing multi-modal logistics parks is a welcome step, promising to ease bottlenecks and improve connectivity. By addressing these challenges, we can unlock the true potential of Indian manufacturing and enhance its competitiveness on the global stage.", "normalised": "What can be done?
