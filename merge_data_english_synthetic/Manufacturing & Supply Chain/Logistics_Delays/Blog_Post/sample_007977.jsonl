{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure limitations are a significant hurdle. Our roads, particularly in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, often suffer from poor maintenance, causing damage to goods and adding transit time. Port congestion at major hubs like Nhava Sheva (JNPT) is another common issue, leading to shipment backlogs and increased demurrage charges. Recently, heavy monsoon rains caused significant disruptions, delaying shipments from Chennai and other coastal regions by almost 2 weeks.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of these delays is substantial. Increased inventory holding costs, lost sales opportunities, and damaged customer relationships are just a few consequences. Companies are forced to absorb the extra costs, impacting their bottom line. For instance, a steel manufacturer based in Bokaro lost approximately Rs. 5 lakhs due to a delayed shipment of iron ore from Odisha, a distance of only 300 km.", "normalised": "The impact of these delays is substantial.
