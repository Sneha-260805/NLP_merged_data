A sudden strike by truck drivers protesting fuel price hikes (even a nominal Rs. 2 increase per litre) can bring his production to a standstill. These external factors, unpredictable as they are, contribute significantly to delivery delays.", "normalised": "So, what are the usual suspects?

Poor inventory management within the 10,000 sq ft warehouse, inefficient loading/unloading processes, and outdated tracking systems can all slow things down. Imagine goods sitting idle because the warehouse staff can't locate them quickly enough!", "normalised": "Then there are internal inefficiencies.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, infrastructure limitations, particularly in certain regions of India, play a role. Potholed roads, congested ports like Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), and unreliable railway networks all contribute to longer transit times. Even a simple delay at a toll naka due to manual processing can add hours to the journey.", "normalised": "Furthermore, infrastructure limitations, particularly in certain regions of India, play a role.
