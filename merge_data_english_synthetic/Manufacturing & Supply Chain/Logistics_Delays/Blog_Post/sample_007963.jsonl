{"unnormalised": "One major contributor is, predictably, the monsoon. The heavy rains disrupt transportation routes across the country. National Highway 44, vital for connecting Kashmir to Kanyakumari, often experiences significant blockages, impacting the movement of goods for days, even weeks. This is especially tough on companies reliant on just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing principles, potentially halting production lines. Imagine the plight of a saree manufacturer in Surat waiting for a delayed consignment of silk from Bangalore!", "normalised": "One major contributor is, predictably, the monsoon.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure limitations play a significant role. While the government is heavily investing in improvements (think projects like the Bharatmala Pariyojana), road congestion in major industrial hubs like Pune and Chennai continues to cause delays. A truck carrying components from Manesar to a factory in Gurgaon might easily lose 2-3 hours stuck in traffic.", "normalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure limitations play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, discrepancies in logistics provider performance are common. Smaller trucking companies often lack the technology and infrastructure to provide real-time tracking and efficient routing, leading to unexpected delays. Many MSMEs reliant on such providers are then left in the dark.", "normalised": "Moreover, discrepancies in logistics provider performance are common.

{"unnormalised": "To combat these challenges, companies are increasingly turning to sophisticated supply chain management solutions. IIM Ahmedabad offers excellent courses on this topic, emphasizing demand forecasting and inventory optimization, which are critical for buffering against potential delays. Investing in robust planning, diversifying transportation options (rail and inland waterways where feasible), and building strong relationships with reliable logistics partners are all essential steps to navigating the complexities of the Indian supply chain and minimizing the impact of inevitable logistics delays. Addressing these challenges is not just good business; it's crucial for India's manufacturing sector to truly compete on a global scale.", "normalised": "To combat these challenges, companies are increasingly turning to sophisticated supply chain management solutions.
