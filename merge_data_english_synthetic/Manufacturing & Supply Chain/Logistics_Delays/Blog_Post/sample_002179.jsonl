{"unnormalised": "One major culprit, familiar to everyone from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is the monsoon season. Torrential rains often paralyze transportation networks, leading to delays in material delivery and finished goods dispatch. We see trucks stranded for days, impacting production schedules, especially for industries dependent on just-in-time inventory management. Last year, our supplier in Nagpur reported a 7-day delay due to floods, impacting the Diwali rush for our consumer goods line.", "normalised": "One major culprit, familiar to everyone from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is the monsoon season.

Many trucks are old and prone to breakdowns, leading to unforeseen delays. A recent consignment traveling from Chennai to Kolkata got delayed by 48 hours due to a mechanical failure, adding significantly to our costs.", "normalised": "Finally, a shortage of skilled drivers and well-maintained vehicles can further exacerbate logistical challenges.
