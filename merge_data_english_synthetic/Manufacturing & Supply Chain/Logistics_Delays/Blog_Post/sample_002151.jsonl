{"unnormalised": "One significant culprit is the monsoon season. From June to September, heavy rains routinely disrupt transportation networks across the country. Roads become impassable, railways face track damage, and port operations slow down. Imagine trying to get a shipment of steel from Jamshedpur to Chennai during peak monsoon! These delays can easily add weeks to delivery schedules, impacting production timelines and increasing costs.", "normalised": "One significant culprit is the monsoon season.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure bottlenecks remain a major issue. Despite ongoing efforts to improve connectivity, many areas still suffer from inadequate road and rail networks. The \"golden quadrilateral\" highway project, while a significant achievement, hasn't completely eradicated these problems. Trucks often face long queues at toll booths, leading to significant delays.", "normalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure bottlenecks remain a major issue.

Remember the chaos depicted in the Bollywood film \"Black Friday\"? While fictionalized, it highlights the vulnerability of our systems to unforeseen disruptions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, unexpected events like strikes (bandhs), political protests, and even local festivals can disrupt supply chains.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can be done? Manufacturers need to build resilience into their supply chains by diversifying sourcing options, investing in robust inventory management systems, and adopting advanced technologies for tracking and tracing shipments. Predictive analytics can also help anticipate potential delays and proactively mitigate their impact. Investing in better infrastructure, modernizing customs procedures, and promoting greater coordination between government agencies and private sector stakeholders are also crucial steps. A delay of 5 days can increase the cost by Rs. 5,000 per km, and therefore cost should be minimized. The government aims to improve logistical efficiency by 10% in the next 2 years.", "normalised": "So, what can be done?
