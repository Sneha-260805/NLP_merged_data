{"unnormalised": "One major culprit is often infrastructure. Think congested highways like the NH44 between Delhi and Srinagar. Imagine a truck carrying components for a new smartphone manufacturing plant gets stuck for days due to unforeseen delays caused by landslides. This simple disruption could cascade into weeks of missed deadlines and inflated costs. Then there's the sheer volume of goods being transported daily, putting immense pressure on ports like Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) near Mumbai, leading to longer turnaround times.", "normalised": "One major culprit is often infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, inefficient warehousing practices contribute to delays. Consider a garment exporter in Tiruppur with limited warehouse space of just 5,000 sq ft, struggling to consolidate shipments before they are dispatched to international buyers. This often leads to piecemeal dispatches and increased documentation hassles, ultimately impacting delivery schedules.", "normalised": "Furthermore, inefficient warehousing practices contribute to delays.

{"unnormalised": "Documentation and bureaucratic hurdles also play a significant role. Obtaining the necessary permits and clearances, especially when crossing state borders, can be a time-consuming affair. The complexity of GST regulations adds another layer of intricacy. Dr. Sharma, a renowned logistics expert from IIM Ahmedabad, often emphasizes the need for streamlining these processes to reduce delays.", "normalised": "Documentation and bureaucratic hurdles also play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, unpredictable weather patterns, particularly during the monsoon season, can wreak havoc on transportation networks. Heavy rains and flooding can render roads impassable, disrupting the smooth flow of goods. A shipment of raw materials from Kolkata to a pharmaceutical company in Hyderabad, costing Rs. 5 Lakhs, could be delayed by several days, potentially affecting drug production.", "normalised": "Finally, unpredictable weather patterns, particularly during the monsoon season, can wreak havoc on transportation networks.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach, including infrastructure improvements, better warehouse management, simplified regulations, and robust contingency planning. Embrace technology such as real-time tracking systems, to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential disruptions. Only then can Indian manufacturers effectively compete in the global arena.", "normalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach, including infrastructure improvements, better warehouse management, simplified regulations, and robust contingency planning.
