{"unnormalised": "Firstly, infrastructure challenges are a major culprit. The often-congested roads and railways, especially around major industrial hubs like Chennai and Kolkata, add significant time to transit. Imagine a consignment of raw materials meant for a garment factory in Tiruppur getting stuck for days due to a railway bottleneck. That's a production delay staring you right in the face.", "normalised": "Firstly, infrastructure challenges are a major culprit.

From improving the Golden Quadrilateral to utilizing GPS tracking and AI-powered logistics solutions, proactive measures can ensure smoother operations and prevent delays costing lakhs of Rupees. Ignoring them means potentially losing out to nimble competitors who are better equipped to navigate the logistical maze. Ultimately, it is a question of optimizing the entire journey of raw materials, say from mines in Odisha to assembly plants near Bangalore, reducing turnaround time & improving profitability.", "normalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach, including investing in infrastructure, simplifying regulations, embracing technology, and fostering better coordination between all stakeholders.
