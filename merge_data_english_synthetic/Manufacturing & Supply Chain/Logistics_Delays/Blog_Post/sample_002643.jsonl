{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays. The bane of every manufacturer from Ludhiana to Lucknow. In a country as diverse and geographically expansive as India, ensuring timely delivery of raw materials and finished goods can feel like navigating the chaotic streets of Chandni Chowk during Diwali.

{"unnormalised": "These delays have a cascading effect. A late shipment of steel coils from Jamshedpur to a fabrication unit in Faridabad means production halts. This, in turn, impacts downstream deliveries to distributors in Tamil Nadu, leading to frustrated customers and potentially lost sales. The financial implications are significant. Think of the carrying costs of delayed inventory, the added transportation expenses (Rs. 5,000 for an expedited shipment?), and the damage to brand reputation. Dr. Sharma at IIM Ahmedabad has published research showing that logistics inefficiencies can erode up to 15% of a manufacturer's bottom line.", "normalised": "These delays have a cascading effect.

Investments in infrastructure, simplified regulatory processes, and the adoption of technologies like AI-powered route optimization and real-time tracking are crucial. We need to move beyond the \"chalta hai\" mentality and embrace a culture of efficiency and precision in our logistics operations. Perhaps then, we can finally unlock the true potential of Indian manufacturing.", "normalised": "Overcoming these challenges requires a concerted effort from both the government and private sector.
