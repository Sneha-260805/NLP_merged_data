{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly congested roads and port operations, remain a significant challenge. Consider the journey of components from Ludhiana to Chennai – unforeseen traffic snarls, especially around major urban centers like Nagpur, can easily add days to the delivery schedule. The monsoon season, a lifeline for agriculture, simultaneously cripples transportation networks with floods and landslides, leading to delays that can push delivery dates back by weeks. Remember the chaos we saw in 2023, impacting the cotton harvest and textile mills across Gujarat?", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays.

{"unnormalised": "Further complicating matters is the complexity of documentation and customs clearance. While initiatives like GST have streamlined processes to some extent, bureaucratic hurdles persist. Imagine a small-scale manufacturer in Coimbatore exporting handicrafts to Europe; the paperwork alone can be a monumental task, delaying shipments and adding to administrative costs. The efficiency of clearing shipments at ports like Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) directly impacts the turnaround time for import and export activities.", "normalised": "Further complicating matters is the complexity of documentation and customs clearance.

Shortage of skilled labor in warehousing and transportation, combined with reliance on outdated technology in some segments, contributes to inefficiencies.

{"unnormalised": "To combat these delays, businesses must invest in robust supply chain management systems. Leveraging technology for real-time tracking and predictive analytics can help anticipate potential disruptions. Building strong relationships with reliable logistics partners, perhaps graduating from NITIE's (National Institute of Industrial Engineering) logistics programs, can also prove invaluable. Proactive communication with suppliers and customers is essential to manage expectations and minimize the impact of unforeseen delays.", "normalised": "To combat these delays, businesses must invest in robust supply chain management systems.
