{"unnormalised": "One major factor is the annual monsoon season. The torrential rains regularly disrupt transportation networks. Roads become impassable, especially in states like Maharashtra and Kerala. This directly impacts the movement of raw materials like steel and cotton from mines/farms in places like Chattisgarh to manufacturing hubs like Pune and Coimbatore. Imagine a textile mill in Tirupur facing delays in receiving its cotton consignment - that can cripple production for days!", "normalised": "One major factor is the annual monsoon season.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, infrastructure bottlenecks remain a challenge. While projects like Bharatmala Pariyojana aim to improve road connectivity, progress is slow in certain regions. Overcrowded ports like JNPT in Mumbai also contribute. Clearing customs, handling documentation, and transporting goods from the port can take considerably longer than anticipated. A consignment of electronic components from Chennai to Bengaluru, covering roughly 335 km, might get delayed by 2-3 days due to congestion at toll plazas and border check posts.", "normalised": "Furthermore, infrastructure bottlenecks remain a challenge.

{"unnormalised": "The impact on SMEs is particularly severe. A delay in receiving a crucial component, say a specialized machine part costing Rs. 50,000, can halt an entire production line. For smaller manufacturers with limited warehousing space (perhaps 1000 sq ft), delays mean increased storage costs and potential damage to inventory.", "normalised": "The impact on S M Es is particularly severe.

{"unnormalised": "To mitigate these challenges, businesses are exploring alternative solutions. This includes investing in better inventory management systems, diversifying transportation modes (rail vs road), and exploring regional warehousing options. Dr. Sharma at IIM Ahmedabad suggests that greater adoption of technology like real-time tracking and predictive analytics can also help anticipate and manage potential disruptions. Collaborating with reliable logistics partners who understand the local landscape and can navigate the monsoon season effectively is also crucial. Ultimately, proactive planning and a resilient supply chain are essential to overcoming the perennial challenge of logistics delays in the Indian manufacturing ecosystem.", "normalised": "To mitigate these challenges, businesses are exploring alternative solutions.
