{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays are a perennial challenge for manufacturing and supply chains globally, but in India, these challenges are often amplified by unique local factors. From unpredictable monsoons impacting road transport to infrastructural bottlenecks, manufacturers in places like Gurgaon, Haryana, constantly grapple with disruptions.", "normalised": "Logistics delays are a perennial challenge for manufacturing and supply chains globally, but in India, these challenges are often amplified by unique local factors.

{"unnormalised": "One major culprit is, undoubtedly, the weather. The monsoon season, stretching from June to September, regularly inundates key transport routes. Think flooded highways disrupting truck movements from Mumbai to Nagpur, leading to delays in raw material delivery and finished goods dispatch. A recent report by IIM Ahmedabad estimated that monsoon-related delays cost the Indian economy upwards of Rs. 25,000 crore annually.", "normalised": "One major culprit is, undoubtedly, the weather.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure gaps also play a significant role. While initiatives like the Bharatmala Pariyojana are aimed at improving road networks, progress is often slow. Overcrowded ports like JNPT further exacerbate the issue, creating backlogs in import-export operations. Imagine a consignment of textiles, crucial for Diwali sales, stuck in port due to customs clearance delays!", "normalised": "Beyond the weather, infrastructure gaps also play a significant role.
