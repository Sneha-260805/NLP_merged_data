{"unnormalised": "These are not isolated incidents. Factors contributing to these delays are multifaceted. Infrastructure bottlenecks, especially around major cities like Delhi and Kolkata, continue to plague efficient transportation. Road congestion, coupled with inadequate warehousing facilities, further exacerbates the problem. The reliance on dated transportation technology and manual processes, even in this age of digitization, also contributes to inefficiencies. Think of it as a real-life “Lagaan” – a battle against the odds, but this time, it’s not cricket, it's commerce!", "normalised": "These are not isolated incidents.
