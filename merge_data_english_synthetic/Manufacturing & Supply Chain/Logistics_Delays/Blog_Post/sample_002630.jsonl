{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays. Infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly around major port cities like Mumbai and Chennai, are a primary culprit. The lack of seamless connectivity between factories in, say, Ludhiana, and these ports means goods are often stuck in transit for extended periods. Consider the case of Gupta Textiles, a major exporter of fabrics; they recently experienced a 2-week delay in shipping a consignment to Europe due to congestion at JNPT.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays.

{"unnormalised": "Further complicating matters is the bureaucratic red tape often associated with inter-state transport. Despite the GST implementation, documentation requirements and check-posts at state borders continue to add to transit times. A shipment of machinery from Pune to Kolkata, covering roughly 1700 km, can realistically take 5-7 days, whereas theoretically, it should be completed in 3.", "normalised": "Further complicating matters is the bureaucratic red tape often associated with inter-state transport.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of warehousing. A shortage of modern, temperature-controlled warehousing space, particularly for industries like pharmaceuticals and food processing, adds to the risk of spoilage and further delays. Dr. Sharma, a supply chain consultant at IIM Ahmedabad, estimates that inadequate warehousing leads to losses of approximately Rs. 10,000 Crores annually. Many smaller manufacturers, operating out of sheds of around 500 sq ft, struggle to maintain inventory flow effectively.", "normalised": "Then there's the issue of warehousing.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes continued investment in infrastructure development, streamlining customs procedures, and encouraging the adoption of technology to improve supply chain visibility. Furthermore, promoting Skill India initiatives to train logistics personnel is crucial. Only then can Indian manufacturing truly compete on a global scale and avoid the crippling effects of these pervasive delays, allowing companies like Tata Steel or Mahindra & Mahindra to operate even more efficiently.", "normalised": "Addressing these logistics delays requires a multi-pronged approach.
