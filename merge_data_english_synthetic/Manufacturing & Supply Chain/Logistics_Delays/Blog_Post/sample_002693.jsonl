{"unnormalised": "Logistics delays. The bane of every manufacturer, from the smallest charkha workshop in Khadi Gram Udyog to multinational giants operating out of Sriperumbudur. In today's fast-paced global market, even a minor hiccup in the supply chain can have cascading effects, impacting production schedules, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, the bottom line.", "normalised": "Logistics delays.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays in the Indian context. Infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly concerning road connectivity in the Northeast and outdated port facilities, are perennial challenges. Imagine a consignment of machine parts coming from Chennai port, destined for a factory in Guwahati. Delays at the Kolkata port due to congestion, followed by slow trucking speeds on NH 31, can easily add days to the delivery schedule.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these delays in the Indian context.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, bureaucratic processes, even with initiatives like GST, can still create bottlenecks. Documentation discrepancies, customs clearance delays, and state-level transit permits can stall shipments for days, if not weeks. We recently saw a client, Mr. Sharma from Faridabad, lose a substantial export order (valued at Rs. 50 lakhs) because of a delayed shipment caught up in paperwork related to environmental clearances.", "normalised": "Furthermore, bureaucratic processes, even with initiatives like G S T, can still create bottlenecks.

{"unnormalised": "The recent monsoons across Maharashtra and Kerala exacerbated the situation. Landslides and flooded highways disrupted truck movements, causing significant delays in the delivery of raw materials to factories in industrial areas like Chakan (near Pune) and Cochin. Many factories, housed in spaces measuring around 20,000 sq ft, saw significant dips in production.", "normalised": "The recent monsoons across Maharashtra and Kerala exacerbated the situation.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can manufacturers do? Proactive planning is crucial. Diversifying transportation modes (rail, road, waterways), investing in robust supply chain management software, and building strong relationships with reliable logistics partners are essential. Dr. Reddy from IIM Bangalore, a leading expert in supply chain optimization, advocates for a more data-driven approach to forecasting and inventory management to mitigate the impact of unforeseen disruptions. Finally, actively engaging with government agencies to address infrastructural and bureaucratic hurdles can help create a more efficient and resilient logistics ecosystem.", "normalised": "So, what can manufacturers do?
