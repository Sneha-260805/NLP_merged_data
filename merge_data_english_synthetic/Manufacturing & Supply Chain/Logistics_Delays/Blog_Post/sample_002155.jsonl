{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these disruptions. Congestion at major ports like JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) can lead to significant waiting times for ships. Road infrastructure, while improving, still faces challenges in certain regions, particularly in remote areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, adding hours or even days to transit times. Weather events, from monsoon rains causing floods to unexpected cyclones, can further exacerbate the situation. Remember the disrupted supply chains after the floods in Chennai a few years back?", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these disruptions.
