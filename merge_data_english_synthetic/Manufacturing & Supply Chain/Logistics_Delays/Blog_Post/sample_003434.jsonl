{"unnormalised": "One major factor is infrastructure. Consider a consignment of sarees woven in Varanasi destined for a retailer in Chennai. If National Highway 44 experiences unexpected closures due to weather or accidents, the entire shipment faces delays. Poor road conditions, limited cold storage facilities, and congestion at major ports like JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) add to the complexity.", "normalised": "One major factor is infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Bureaucracy also plays a role. The sheer number of permits and documentation required for inter-state transportation can be overwhelming. Dr. Sharma, a supply chain expert from IIM Ahmedabad, points out that simplifying these processes can significantly reduce transit times. Imagine a truck carrying components from a supplier in Pune to a manufacturing plant in Faridabad getting held up due to discrepancies in paperwork. This translates to lost production time and increased costs.", "normalised": "Bureaucracy also plays a role.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of these delays is significant. For a small-scale garment manufacturer in Tiruppur, even a few days' delay can mean missing a crucial export deadline, resulting in hefty penalties and damaged relationships with international buyers. Delays also tie up capital, as manufacturers have to wait longer to receive payment for their goods. For example, a consignment worth Rs. 5 lakhs sitting idle in a warehouse of 5000 sq ft due to customs clearance issues.", "normalised": "The impact of these delays is significant.

{"unnormalised": "To mitigate these risks, Indian manufacturers are increasingly investing in technology, such as real-time tracking systems and predictive analytics, to better manage their supply chains. Building stronger relationships with logistics providers and diversifying transportation modes (road, rail, and air) are also critical strategies. While challenges remain, addressing these issues will pave the way for a more efficient and competitive manufacturing sector in India.", "normalised": "To mitigate these risks, Indian manufacturers are increasingly investing in technology, such as real-time tracking systems and predictive analytics, to better manage their supply chains.
