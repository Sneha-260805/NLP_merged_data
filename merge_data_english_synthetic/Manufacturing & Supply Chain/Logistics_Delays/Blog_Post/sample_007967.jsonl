{"unnormalised": "What are the primary culprits behind these frustrating delays? Often, it's a perfect storm of factors. Infrastructure bottlenecks, especially the notorious congestion at ports like JNPT in Mumbai, play a significant role. Road transport, while often the lifeline for connecting remote manufacturing clusters like those in Coimbatore, faces its own challenges – unpredictable weather patterns, RTO inspections, and the sheer volume of traffic can add days to transit times.", "normalised": "What are the primary culprits behind these frustrating delays?

While initiatives like \"Ease of Doing Business\" are making strides, navigating the bureaucratic maze can still be time-consuming, particularly for smaller enterprises. Consider the case of a textile manufacturer in Tirupur struggling to export a consignment due to unforeseen customs delays. The delay cost them Rs. 5 Lakh in penalties alone.", "normalised": "Then there are the documentation and customs clearance hurdles.
