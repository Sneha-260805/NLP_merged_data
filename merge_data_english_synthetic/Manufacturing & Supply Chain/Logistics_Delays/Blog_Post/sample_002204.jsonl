{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these disruptions. Firstly, infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in transportation, are a major culprit. Imagine a consignment of precision components manufactured in Pune destined for a factory in Chennai. If that shipment encounters unexpected road closures due to monsoon rains or faces severe congestion at a toll plaza near Bangalore, delays are almost inevitable. The recent construction on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, while promising long-term benefits, has temporarily exacerbated such issues.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these disruptions.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, inventory management discrepancies often lead to unforeseen holdups. A miscalculation of raw material requirements, say, steel from Jamshedpur for automobile manufacturing, can halt production lines. This resonates with the famous dialogue from the film \"3 Idiots\" - \"Kaabil bano, kamyabi toh jhak maarke peeche aayegi\" (Become capable, and success will follow). Being \"kaabil\" in inventory management translates to efficient forecasting and real-time tracking.", "normalised": "Secondly, inventory management discrepancies often lead to unforeseen holdups.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing these delays requires a multi-pronged approach. Investing in better infrastructure, optimizing inventory management systems (perhaps with assistance from institutions like IIT Madras's supply chain research group), and streamlining customs procedures are all essential. Furthermore, building resilient supply chains with diversified sourcing options and contingency plans can mitigate the impact of unforeseen disruptions. Implementing real-time tracking and monitoring systems, akin to a modern-day \"Chanakya Niti\" of logistics, is crucial for proactive management and minimizing costly delays. Ignoring these critical aspects can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage.", "normalised": "Addressing these delays requires a multi slash pronged approach.
