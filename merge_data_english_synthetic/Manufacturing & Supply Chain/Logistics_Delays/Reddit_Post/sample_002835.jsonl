These delays are often attributed to \"unforeseen circumstances\" by the transporter, M R L Logistics. We are talking about crucial steel components, mind you. Last week, a shipment was held up near Nagpur due to \"road repairs\" - sounds familiar, doesn't it?"}

What strategies have you found effective in mitigating these disruptions? We have already explored alternate routes and considered increasing our raw material inventory buffer, but the associated warehousing costs are significant (approximately rupee five lakhs per month for additional space). Perhaps negotiating more stringent S L As with transporters or exploring rail freight could be options. We are considering approaching I I M Bangalore's supply chain management experts for a consultation."}
