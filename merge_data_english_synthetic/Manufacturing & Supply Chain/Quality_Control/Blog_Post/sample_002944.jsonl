{"unnormalised": "In the bustling world of Indian manufacturing and supply chains, ensuring quality isn't just a preference; it's essential for survival. Think of it like preparing a delicious biryani for Onam – every ingredient needs to be perfect, the ratios precise, and the cooking time just right, or the entire dish will fall flat. Similarly, in manufacturing, robust quality control (QC) procedures are the key to delivering products that meet customer expectations and adhere to regulations.", "normalised": "In the bustling world of Indian manufacturing and supply chains, ensuring quality isn't just a preference; it's essential for survival.

{"unnormalised": "Quality control encompasses a variety of techniques and activities designed to verify that products or services conform to specified standards. From raw materials to the finished product leaving the factory gates, QC acts as a vigilant guardian. Imagine a textile factory in Tiruppur. Before the cotton even reaches the spinning machines, QC teams will inspect it for fiber length, strength, and impurities. This ensures the yarn produced is of the desired quality.", "normalised": "Quality control encompasses a variety of techniques and activities designed to verify that products or services conform to specified standards.

{"unnormalised": "Common QC methods include visual inspections, statistical process control (SPC), and testing. A factory in Mumbai manufacturing auto components might use SPC to monitor the dimensions of a critical part, ensuring it stays within acceptable tolerances. Testing, on the other hand, can involve destructive and non-destructive methods. Imagine a steel plant in Bhilai testing the tensile strength of a steel beam – this is crucial for ensuring structural integrity in construction projects.", "normalised": "Common Q C methods include visual inspections, statistical process control (S P C), and testing.

{"unnormalised": "The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) plays a significant role in setting quality standards across various industries. Adhering to BIS standards not only ensures product quality but also builds trust with consumers. Poor quality control can lead to costly recalls, damage brand reputation, and even legal repercussions. Think of the consequences of a faulty batch of electrical cables – it could be catastrophic.", "normalised": "The Bureau of Indian Standards (B I S) plays a significant role in setting quality standards across various industries.

{"unnormalised": "Effective QC requires trained personnel and proper documentation. Institutions like IIT Madras offer specialized courses in quality management. Furthermore, implementing QC involves detailed record-keeping, from supplier audits to final product inspections. A good QC system will track data on defects, analyze trends, and identify areas for improvement, preventing similar issues from recurring. For instance, reducing scrap rate from 5% to 2% would save the company approximately Rs. 50,000 per month. Ultimately, strong QC guarantees customer satisfaction and builds a reputation for “shuddh” quality, boosting a company's bottom line and its contribution to the 'Make in India' initiative.", "normalised": "Effective Q C requires trained personnel and proper documentation.
