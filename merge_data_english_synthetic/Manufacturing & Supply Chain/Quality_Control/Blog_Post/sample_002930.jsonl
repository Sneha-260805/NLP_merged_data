{"unnormalised": "Quality control (QC) isn't just about catching defects at the end of the production line. It's a holistic approach encompassing every stage, from sourcing raw materials to final delivery. Think of it like crafting the perfect biryani – each ingredient, from the finest basmati rice to the aromatic spices, needs to be of top quality. If even one component is off, the entire dish suffers.", "normalised": "Quality control (Q C) isn't just about catching defects at the end of the production line.

{"unnormalised": "In manufacturing, QC involves rigorous testing and inspection. Imagine a factory producing motorcycle parts in Pune. Before components are shipped, they undergo dimensional checks, material testing, and performance evaluations to ensure they adhere to the required specifications. For instance, a batch of brake pads might undergo friction coefficient testing to guarantee safe braking performance. A deviation of even 0.05 in the coefficient could mean a safety hazard.", "normalised": "In manufacturing, Q C involves rigorous testing and inspection.

{"unnormalised": "The supply chain aspect of QC focuses on vendor management and traceability. Companies often use methods like Six Sigma, a popular methodology taught at IIM Ahmedabad, to reduce variations and improve process efficiency. Think of procuring steel for construction – ensuring it meets IS standards and is sourced from a reputable vendor in Bhilai is critical to the safety and integrity of the building.", "normalised": "The supply chain aspect of Q C focuses on vendor management and traceability.

{"unnormalised": "QC also has a financial impact. Implementing a robust QC system can significantly reduce waste, minimize recalls, and enhance brand reputation. A company in Delhi investing Rs. 50,000 in a new testing machine might see a reduction in rejected parts by 15%, leading to savings of Rs. 2,00,000 per annum.", "normalised": "Q C also has a financial impact. Implementing a robust Q C system can significantly reduce waste, minimize recalls, and enhance brand reputation.

{"unnormalised": "During festivals like Onam, consumers expect the products they purchase to be of the highest quality. Poor QC can lead to disappointing experiences and damage a brand's image, especially when expectations are high. Implementing Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques helps monitor manufacturing processes and quickly identify any deviations before they lead to defects. Ensuring quality, from the chai brewed for employees to the final product, should be a priority. Effective QC ultimately translates to customer loyalty and sustained growth in the competitive Indian market.", "normalised": "During festivals like Onam, consumers expect the products they purchase to be of the highest quality.
