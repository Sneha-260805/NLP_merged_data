{"unnormalised": "Quality control (QC) is the linchpin of any successful manufacturing and supply chain operation, especially in a vibrant and competitive market like India. Imagine preparing a delicious biryani – you wouldn't just throw ingredients together haphazardly, would you? You’d carefully measure spices, ensure the rice is of good quality, and monitor the cooking process to achieve that perfect flavour profile. Similarly, QC in manufacturing involves systematically monitoring and maintaining standards to ensure consistent and reliable products.", "normalised": "Quality control (Q C) is the linchpin of any successful manufacturing and supply chain operation, especially in a vibrant and competitive market like India.

This isn’t just about ticking boxes; it's about building trust and establishing a reputation for quality. A faulty batch of saris reaching customers during Diwali, or defective machine parts causing production delays, can have significant repercussions for a company’s brand image and bottom line (read: significant loss of Rs.).", "normalised": "From textiles in Tirupur to auto components in Pune, industries across India rely on robust Q C measures.

{"unnormalised": "Effective QC minimizes waste, reduces returns, and improves customer satisfaction. A well-defined QC process can help a manufacturer in Coimbatore produce 10,000 units with a defect rate of less than 1%, as opposed to a higher rate leading to rework and wasted resources. Investing in QC is therefore an investment in long-term success and competitiveness, vital for any business looking to thrive in the Indian market and beyond. A stitch in time saves nine, as the saying goes, and a bit of diligent quality control can save countless rupees and reputations.", "normalised": "Effective Q C minimizes waste, reduces returns, and improves customer satisfaction.
