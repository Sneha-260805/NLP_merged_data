Every ingredient needs to be of the highest quality, the cooking process needs precise monitoring, and the final product needs rigorous tasting to ensure it meets the expected standard. Similarly, in manufacturing, quality control encompasses all the activities that ensure our products meet pre-defined standards and customer expectations.", "normalised": "Think of it like crafting the perfect Hyderabadi biryani.

Is the cotton from Maharashtra free from contaminants? Imagine a batch of saris being rejected because the dye, sourced from a supplier near Kolkata, bleeds after washing. Early detection saves Rs. 10,000s in potential losses and reputation damage.", "normalised": "What does this involve? Firstly, rigorous raw material inspection.

{"unnormalised": "In the spirit of Onam, where everything is presented flawlessly, quality control aims to deliver products that are perfect in every aspect. Techniques like Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), sometimes taught at institutions like IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad, are increasingly employed to improve efficiency and reduce defects. Finally, effective quality control reduces waste, enhances customer satisfaction, and builds brand reputation – essential for long-term success in the competitive Indian market and beyond. A defective batch could mean re-calling thousands of units and potentially harm brand value severely.", "normalised": "In the spirit of Onam, where everything is presented flawlessly, quality control aims to deliver products that are perfect in every aspect.
