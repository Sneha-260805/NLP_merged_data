If the biryani arrives bland, undercooked, or with the wrong ingredients, that’s a quality control failure. Similarly, in manufacturing, a defective component can lead to costly recalls and damage to reputation.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: imagine ordering Hyderabadi biryani online.

{"unnormalised": "QC encompasses a range of activities, from inspecting raw materials like steel imported from Korea, to monitoring production processes and rigorously testing finished goods. For example, a textile factory in Surat might use statistical process control to monitor the tensile strength of the fabric they produce. If the strength falls below a certain threshold (say, 1500 N), the process needs immediate adjustment.", "normalised": "Q C encompasses a range of activities, from inspecting raw materials like steel imported from Korea, to monitoring production processes and rigorously testing finished goods.
