{"unnormalised": "In the intricate dance of manufacturing and supply chains, quality control (QC) isn't just a checklist; it's the lifeblood that sustains customer trust and ensures brand reputation. Imagine a batch of perfectly spiced Hyderabadi biryani – one bad batch can ruin the entire experience! Similarly, poor quality control in manufacturing can lead to defective products, costly recalls, and a tarnished image.", "normalised": "In the intricate dance of manufacturing and supply chains, quality control (Q C) isn't just a checklist; it's the lifeblood that sustains customer trust and ensures brand reputation.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: every stage, from sourcing raw materials like jute from West Bengal for bags, to the final assembly in a factory near Chennai, is a potential point of failure. That's where rigorous QC steps in. It involves meticulously inspecting materials, monitoring production processes, and testing finished goods to meet predetermined standards. For example, a textile company, “Kala Niketan,” needs to ensure the yarn count meets a specific R value or else, the fabric won't meet export quality.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: every stage, from sourcing raw materials like jute from West Bengal for bags, to the final assembly in a factory near Chennai, is a potential point of failure.
