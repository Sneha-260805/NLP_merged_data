{"unnormalised": "Several QC methods exist. We have visual inspection, where experienced technicians like Ravi Kumar, who’s been inspecting engine parts at the Bajaj plant for 15 years, can spot defects with a trained eye. Then there’s destructive testing, like stress-testing metal components in a lab, and non-destructive testing like X-raying electronics boards for hidden flaws.", "normalised": "Several Q C methods exist.

{"unnormalised": "Why is QC so vital? Firstly, it reduces defects. A flawed product hitting the market can damage your brand’s reputation. Imagine a batch of sarees from Kanchipuram with uneven weaving – customers would be rightfully disappointed. Secondly, it enhances efficiency. By identifying problems early on, you can prevent costly rework or recalls. Spending Rs. 10,000 now on QC could save you Rs. 1,00,000 later in warranty claims. Thirdly, QC compliance builds trust with customers and partners.", "normalised": "Why is Q C so vital? Firstly, it reduces defects.

{"unnormalised": "Investing in robust QC is not just a cost; it’s an investment in your long-term success and sustainability. It's the essential ingredient that elevates your manufacturing operations from acceptable to exceptional. From the smallest SME in Coimbatore to the largest multinational in Gurgaon, quality control is the cornerstone of a thriving manufacturing sector. A distance of 500 km means nothing if the quality isn't maintained across that distance.", "normalised": "Investing in robust Q C is not just a cost; it is an investment in your long-term success and sustainability.
