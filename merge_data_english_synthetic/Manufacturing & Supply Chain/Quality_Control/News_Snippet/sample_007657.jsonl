{"unnormalised": "Companies like Tata Steel are already demonstrating the impact of advanced quality control, showcasing fewer product recalls and enhanced customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the report details how improving quality management can lead to significant cost savings, estimated to be around Rs. 50 Lakhs annually for a medium-sized manufacturing unit, primarily through minimizing rework and rejected materials. This translates to stronger competitiveness in both domestic and international markets. The implementation of Six Sigma methodologies is also gaining traction.", "normalised": "companies like tata steel are already demonstrating the impact of advanced quality control, showcasing fewer product recalls and enhanced customer satisfaction. furthermore, the report details how improving quality management can lead to significant cost savings, estimated to be around rupee fifty lakhs annually for a medium-sized manufacturing unit, primarily through minimizing rework and rejected materials. this translates to stronger competitiveness in both domestic and international markets. the implementation of six sigma methodologies is also gaining traction."}
