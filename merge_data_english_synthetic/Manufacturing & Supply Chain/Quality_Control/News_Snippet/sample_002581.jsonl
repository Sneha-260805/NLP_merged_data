{"unnormalised": "The seminar covered practical applications including case studies from Tata Steel and Mahindra & Mahindra, showing defect reductions exceeding 15% after implementing advanced QC measures. Techniques like Kaizen and Poka-Yoke, deeply rooted in manufacturing philosophy, were discussed. The focus was on empowering line workers to identify and rectify issues immediately, improving efficiency. A subsequent webinar is scheduled for 10/11/2024 at 14:00 hrs. Companies are advised to prioritise investment in QC, for long-term gains and customer satisfaction, referencing the \"Make in India\" initiative's stress on quality products by 2030. Continuous QC process monitoring should be practiced, possibly with a review meeting at 09:30 hrs every Monday.", "normalised": "The seminar covered practical applications including case studies from Tata Steel and Mahindra and Mahindra, showing defect reductions exceeding fifteen percent after implementing advanced Q C measures.
