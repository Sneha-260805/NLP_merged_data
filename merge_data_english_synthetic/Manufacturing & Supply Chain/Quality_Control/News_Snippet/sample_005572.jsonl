These revisions are expected to include more stringent testing parameters and mandatory certifications. Analysts estimate that upgrading quality control infrastructure across the sector could cost Rs. 500 Crores and require an additional 10,000 sq ft of testing space per major manufacturing unit. The impact on the supply chain, from Ludhiana's auto parts hub to Chennai's car factories, remains to be seen.", "normalised": "The Bureau of Indian Standards (B I S) is reportedly considering revising existing quality standards for key automotive components.
