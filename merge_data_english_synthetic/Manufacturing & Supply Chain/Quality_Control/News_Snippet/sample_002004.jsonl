{"unnormalised": "Experts point to the need for a \"3 Idiots\"-esque approach, emphasizing innovation and critical thinking in quality assurance, rather than rote adherence to checklists. Specific areas of concern include the precision machining of engine parts and the reliability testing of electronic circuits. Failure rates have reportedly increased by 7% in certain product lines, potentially costing manufacturers crores of Rupees in recalls and reputational damage. NIQA aims to reduce these failures by 15% by the end of next year.", "normalised": "Experts point to the need for a \"three Idiots\"-esque approach, emphasizing innovation and critical thinking in quality assurance, rather than rote adherence to checklists.
