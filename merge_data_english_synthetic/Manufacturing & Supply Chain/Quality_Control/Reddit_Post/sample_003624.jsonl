What strategies have you found effective in bridging the Q C gap? We are particularly interested in how automation and A I can improve defect detection in areas like fabric inspection (e g, identifying flaws in a one thousand square feet roll). We are looking for any insightful anecdotes, case studies or best practices from the field. Jai Hind!"}
