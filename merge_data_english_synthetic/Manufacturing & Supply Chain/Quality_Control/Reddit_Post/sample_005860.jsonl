A significant number of parts fail initial inspections, leading to delays and increased Rs. cost per unit. One specific case involved a batch of 1,000 rotors exceeding the specified diameter by 0.5mm.", "normalised": "We've observed recurring issues with dimensional accuracy of components like brake rotors and suspension arms.

{"unnormalised": "The challenges seem to stem from a combination of factors: outdated machinery, inadequate operator training (especially with regards to statistical process control), and a lack of robust documentation as per IATF 16949 standards. One of the factories had only a basic Go/No-Go gauge for inspecting components, which, according to Dr. Sharma from IIT Bombay, is simply insufficient for modern requirements.", "normalised": "The challenges seem to stem from a combination of factors: outdated machinery, inadequate operator training (especially with regards to statistical process control), and a lack of robust documentation as per I A T F sixteen thousand nine hundred and forty nine standards.
