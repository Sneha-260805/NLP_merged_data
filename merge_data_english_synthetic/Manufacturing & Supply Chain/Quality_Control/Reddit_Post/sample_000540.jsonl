We all know \"Make in India\" is driving growth, but maintaining consistent quality across vendors and processes remains a significant hurdle."}
{"unnormalised": "Namaste everyone,", "normalised": "I've observed, particularly when dealing with smaller M S M Es around places like Coimbatore and Ludhiana, that Q C practices can be, let's say, variable. Standardized testing protocols, especially for things like tensile strength (measured in megapascals, of course!), aren't always consistently applied. This impacts everything, ultimately affecting customer satisfaction and potentially leading to costly recalls down the line. For instance, imagine a faulty component from Tiruchirappalli delaying a train scheduled for fifth september two thousand and twenty four."}

Are you finding success with initiatives like Six Sigma training, or implementing more rigorous inspection procedures at various stages? Has anyone dealt with issues related to counterfeit components entering the supply chain, and how did you mitigate them? I'm also curious about the role of technology – A I-powered Q C, for example. Also, I would like to invite you all to join a webinar on \"Q C improvement\" on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four at two o'clock P M, organized by I I T Madras. Any thoughts on improving Q C standards and reducing issues like a ten percent defect rate for product R. manufactured in Delhi on twelfth october two thousand and twenty three? Please share your experiences and insights!"}
