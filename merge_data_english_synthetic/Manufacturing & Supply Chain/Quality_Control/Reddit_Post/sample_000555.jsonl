We implemented a new system at 14:00 hrs on 02/10/2023, and the initial reports are mixed. Also, how do we address the skill gap in QC personnel, given the growing demands of Industry 4.0? My old college, IIT Bombay, is starting a new course on data analytics for QC which should help. Finally, how are you managing QC costs? I've heard of companies spending upwards of Rs. 5 Lakhs per quarter on QC alone.", "normalised": "I'm particularly interested in hearing about experiences with automated Q C systems.
