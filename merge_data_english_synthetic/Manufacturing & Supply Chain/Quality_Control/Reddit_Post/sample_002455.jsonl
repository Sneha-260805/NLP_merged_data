Think preventative maintenance on machines, rigorous raw material inspections (making sure that steel from Bokaro Steel Plant meets the required standards), and thorough process monitoring.", "normalised": "Good Q C isn't just about catching defects at the end of the line, like finding a scratch on a newly manufactured Maruti car.

Implementing statistical process control (SPC) to monitor production parameters, like diameter of a component in mm or screw tightness in N-m, is crucial. Also, training your workforce on these concepts is very important. Remember the film \"Three Idiots?\" Aamir Khan's character pushed for understanding, not just rote learning.
