{"unnormalised": "Why is QC so vital? First, it minimizes defects, reducing rework and scrap costs. Imagine if Tata Motors released cars with faulty brakes – the recall costs would be astronomical! Second, it enhances customer satisfaction, leading to brand loyalty. Customers in Mumbai will always prefer a reliable product. Third, it improves operational efficiency. A well-defined QC process identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies in production.", "normalised": "Why is Q C so vital? First, it minimizes defects, reducing rework and scrap costs.

{"unnormalised": "Some key areas in QC include: Raw material inspection (checking the quality of steel from SAIL, for example), in-process inspection (monitoring production at each stage – like ensuring the right thread count in fabric from Tirupur), and final product inspection (verifying the product meets all specifications before dispatch, maybe testing light bulbs at 17:00 hrs before they go to local shops).", "normalised": "Some key areas in Q C include: Raw material inspection (checking the quality of steel from S A I L, for example), in-process inspection (monitoring production at each stage – like ensuring the right thread count in fabric from Tirupur), and final product inspection (verifying the product meets all specifications before dispatch, maybe testing light bulbs at five P M before they go to local shops)."}
