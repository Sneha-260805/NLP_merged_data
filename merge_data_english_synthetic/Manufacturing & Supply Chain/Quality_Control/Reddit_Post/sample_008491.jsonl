For context, we manufacture cotton shirting fabrics destined for tailors across India. Lately, we've been seeing a higher-than-acceptable number of defects per 1000 sq ft roll, primarily related to uneven dye application and thread breakage. Our AQL is set at 2.5%, but we're consistently exceeding 3.5% in the last month.", "normalised": "We are facing some consistent quality issues at our Faridabad plant, specifically with our textile output.

Dr. Kumar at IIT Delhi also does some research in this area. I am also planning a factory visit to a silk manufacturing unit in Kanchipuram to observe best practices. Any inputs from others?
