{"unnormalised": "Has anyone here implemented similar solutions in their Indian manufacturing units? What were your experiences? Are there any affordable, effective alternatives to 100% inspection that you’d recommend? Any insights on navigating quality audits (like ISO 9001 or similar) in the Indian context would also be highly appreciated. Any tips or advice, especially relating to sari fabric production is welcomed. Thanks in advance!", "normalised": "Has anyone here implemented similar solutions in their Indian manufacturing units?
