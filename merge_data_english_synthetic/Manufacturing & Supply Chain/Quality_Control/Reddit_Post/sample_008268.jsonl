Regular audits, calibration of measuring instruments (like ensuring the scales read weight correctly, in kg or Ratti), and documented procedures are all crucial. So, invest in your QC, or else, your customers will definitely find faults, and your profits will take a nosedive. What QC practices do you swear by in your respective sectors?
