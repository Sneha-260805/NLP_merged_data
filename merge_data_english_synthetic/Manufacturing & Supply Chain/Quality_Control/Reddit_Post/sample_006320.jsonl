{"unnormalised": "We're facing some persistent quality control issues at our auto ancillary unit in Chennai. Specifically, we manufacture sheet metal components for Mahindra's XUV series.

{"unnormalised": "We've implemented 100% visual inspection, but obviously, that's not catching everything.

Also, any recommendations for NABL-accredited labs in Tamil Nadu that can perform detailed material analysis? We suspect the source material itself, sourced from Jindal Steel, might occasionally be the issue, even with supplier certifications. Need to ensure we’re not just chasing symptoms. This is impacting delivery timelines significantly, pushing us past our 09/10/2024 deadline for the next XUV batch. Any insights from IIT Madras alumni working in quality control would be especially appreciated!
