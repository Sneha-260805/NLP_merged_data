{"unnormalised": "Recently, we’ve seen a significant spike in rejected items. Specifically, pitting corrosion on the surface of our \"Rani\" brand pressure cookers after just 2 weeks of use. This is happening despite using 304-grade stainless steel from TATA Steel. Our spec sheet clearly states 0.05mm max surface roughness. Turns out, some batches are exceeding that, going all the way up to 0.15mm.", "normalised": "Recently, we’ve seen a significant spike in rejected items.

Moving forward, we’re implementing stricter QC measures, including more frequent salt spray testing and random dimensional checks at 09:00 hrs every morning. We're also considering investing in a surface profilometer.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Q C checks weren't frequent enough.
