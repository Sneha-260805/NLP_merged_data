Any insights or case studies you can share, even anonymized, would be greatly appreciated. Are there notable differences in QC standards between, say, a factory in Chennai and one in Ludhiana? What are the usual timelines involved in setting up a robust QC system, assuming a starting point of 09:30 hrs on a Monday? Your thoughts are valuable.
