Maintaining consistent quality, meeting international standards (I S O nine thousand and one, etcetera), and minimizing rejections (especially for export orders destined for the E U or U S A) is a constant balancing act."}

Do you rely more on statistical process control (S P C), robust incoming material inspection (I M I), or extensive final product testing (F P T)? We are currently using a sampling plan based on A Q L tables, but I'm exploring other options. Doctor Sharma from I I T Delhi suggested incorporating A I powered visual inspection, but the R O I calculations are proving tricky. The factory floor is approximately ten thousand square feet, so implementing automation has its challenges."}
