{"unnormalised": "I'm seeking insights on a recurring quality control issue at our auto component manufacturing unit near Chennai. We're producing precision-engineered parts for Mahindra & Mahindra, and lately, we've been seeing an increase in defect rates, primarily surface imperfections and dimensional deviations exceeding our tolerance levels of +/- 0.05 mm. This directly impacts downstream assembly processes and leads to rejections at the client end.", "normalised": "I am seeking insights on a recurring quality control issue at our auto component manufacturing unit near Chennai.

Our reject analysis indicates a correlation with specific material batches supplied by R.K. Steels, and a slight operator error rate during the afternoon shift (14:00 - 22:00 hrs).", "normalised": "We have implemented standard Q C procedures: incoming material inspection based on I S standards, in-process checks every two hours (starting at zero nine hundred hours), and final inspection using C M M and surface roughness testers.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone experienced similar quality issues with metal components, particularly those sourced from R.K. Steels, or dealt with fluctuating operator performance? Any suggestions on root cause analysis techniques, process optimization, or advanced QC methods we can implement to reduce these defects? We aim to reduce the DPMO to under 500 by Diwali (01/11/2024). The last internal audit happened on 15/08/2023. Any inputs will be greatly appreciated!", "normalised": "Has anyone experienced similar quality issues with metal components, particularly those sourced from R K Steels, or dealt with fluctuating operator performance?
