Has anyone here experienced similar issues in their manufacturing setups, especially dealing with high-volume steel components? Any recommendations for advanced NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) methods suitable for identifying micro-cracks before assembly? Thinking of bringing in consultants from IIT Delhi for a process audit, planned for sometime in April 2024. Any suggestions on specific individuals or departments at IIT known for expertise in metallurgy and heat treatment would be highly appreciated. We need to get this sorted ASAP before our next shipment to Maruti Suzuki leaves on 15/08/2024. Dhanyavaad!", "normalised": "However, the problem persists.
