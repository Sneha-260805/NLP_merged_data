Our vendor in Chennai, despite I S O nine thousand and one certification, has been delivering batches with higher than acceptable defect rates – nearly five percent rejection in the last audit on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty three. What methods have you found effective in proactively identifying and addressing such issues? Things like statistical process control (S P C), root cause analysis, or even incorporating Kaizen principles."}
