{"unnormalised": "In Indian manufacturing, we often see QC departments relying heavily on visual inspections. While useful, a robust system needs statistical process control (SPC), like monitoring the diameter of bearings from a Faridabad factory. We track deviations and trends, intervening *before* defects become widespread. Imagine if Tiffin boxes consistently leaked due to poor sealing; SPC would catch that early.", "normalised": "In Indian manufacturing, we often see Q C departments relying heavily on visual inspections.

A weighing scale that’s off by even 10 gm in a pharmaceutical plant (say, in Baddi) could have serious consequences.

Like teaching new chefs to properly temper chocolate, patience and precision are key. Remember 26/01/1950, the day we adopted our constitution; that same spirit of diligence should be applied to QC. Proper training reduces rework by 20% and ensures customer satisfaction, or, in local parlance, 'Dil khush'.
