We primarily supply cotton kurtis and sarees to retailers across India. We are seeing issues ranging from stitching defects, loose threads, uneven seams, to minor color discrepancies compared to the original design. This affects about five percent of our production, which is unacceptable."}

Has anyone implemented statistical process control, S P C, in their garment manufacturing? Or perhaps incorporated machine vision for automated defect detection? Any recommended vendors or training institutes, preferably in South India, near Chennai or Bangalore? We are thinking of upgrading to a digital system by fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four, and are open to investing in new technologies to address this."}
