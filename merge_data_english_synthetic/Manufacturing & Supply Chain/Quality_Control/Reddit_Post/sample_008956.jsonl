Rejects are mostly due to dimensional inaccuracies (ranging from 0.5mm to 2mm off spec), surface scratches, and inconsistent welding. This is severely impacting our delivery schedules and incurring huge rework costs.", "normalised": "Lately, the defect rate has spiked from two percent to almost seven percent during the last quarter.

Furthermore, the imported steel coil batch we received on 15/08/2023 from JSW Steel has shown higher variability compared to previous batches.

What are some successful initiatives you've implemented, perhaps focusing on lean principles or Kaizen techniques? Insights from veterans in the automotive sector, especially those familiar with suppliers in the Chakan industrial area, would be greatly appreciated.
