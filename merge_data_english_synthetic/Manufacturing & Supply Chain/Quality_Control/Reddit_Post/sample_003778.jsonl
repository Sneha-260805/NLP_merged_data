{"unnormalised": "I'm facing some persistent quality control challenges at our auto-ancillary unit in Nashik, and I’m hoping to get some insights from the community. We manufacture precision components for major OEMs like Tata Motors and Mahindra. Our defect rate has seen a slight uptick lately, specifically in surface finish and dimensional accuracy, and it’s starting to impact our bottom line. We're currently operating at ~ 97% quality yield, but ideally, we need to be consistently above 99%.", "normalised": "I'm facing some persistent quality control challenges at our auto-ancillary unit in Nashik, and I’m hoping to get some insights from the community. We manufacture precision components for major O E M s like Tata Motors and Mahindra.

{"unnormalised": "Our QC process involves stage-wise inspection, from raw material sourcing (mostly from Nagpur) to final product assessment. We use CMMs and other metrology equipment.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone dealt with similar fluctuations in QC in a high-volume, precision manufacturing setting, especially considering the labour constraints we face around festivals like Diwali (scheduled inspection for final delivery: 21/10/2024)? We’re exploring the possibility of implementing a more robust SPC (Statistical Process Control) system and potentially engaging consultants from IIT Bombay for process optimization. Any recommendations, especially on affordable and effective QC tools or best practices suitable for an SME like ours would be greatly appreciated. My team has a meeting on 07/07/2024 to discuss this and your insights would be valuable. We currently do 100% inspection of critical dimensions using go/no-go gauges and automated systems, plus R&R studies. We use ISO 9001 quality systems. How can we improve further?", "normalised": "Has anyone dealt with similar fluctuations in Q C in a high-volume, precision manufacturing setting, especially considering the labor constraints we face around festivals like Diwali (scheduled inspection for final delivery: twenty first october two thousand and twenty four)?
