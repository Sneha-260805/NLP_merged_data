The factory floor is about 20,000 sq ft. What specific QC methodologies (beyond basic visual inspection) have you found effective in similar textile manufacturing scenarios? Are there particular training programs for QC inspectors that are highly regarded in India? Any advice on addressing yarn tension issues would also be greatly appreciated. Any thoughts or experiences you could share would be incredibly helpful in maintaining our reputation. Jai Hind!", "normalised": "However, we’re still seeing issues.
