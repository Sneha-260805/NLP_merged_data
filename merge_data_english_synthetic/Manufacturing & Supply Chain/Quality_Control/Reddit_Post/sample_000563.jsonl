For example, a shipment of yarn that *just* meets the tensile strength requirement of 1500 N is still accepted, even if a slightly better process could easily yield 1600 N.", "normalised": "My observation is that too much emphasis is placed on simply meeting the existing benchmarks (I S standards etcetera) rather than striving for continuous improvement.
