Anyone here have experience implementing these in Indian settings, particularly with legacy machinery? What's your take on the R O I given the costs involved, and the relative reliability of skilled labor in our sector?"}

Are there specific training programs or certifications you recommend? We've been looking at programs offered by institutions like I I T Madras. One of the issues is lack of adherence during festivals - production suffers, but deadlines remain, sometimes leading to compromises.
