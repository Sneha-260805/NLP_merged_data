It's often seen as just a check-the-box exercise, but it’s fundamentally about ensuring your product meets the required specifications, consistently. Think of it as ensuring every 'Kesar Mango' from Ratnagiri is sweet and unblemished, not just some of them."}

It's often seen as just a check-the-box exercise, but it’s fundamentally about ensuring your product meets the required specifications, *consistently*.

Implementing robust Q C procedures minimizes wastage, reduces customer complaints (think: those angry calls on Diwali after ordering 'diyas' that arrived broken), and builds brand reputation. Imagine I S R O launching a P S L V rocket from Sriharikota at exactly nine hours on fifteenth august nineteen forty seven without rigorous Q C on every single component. Catastrophe!"}
