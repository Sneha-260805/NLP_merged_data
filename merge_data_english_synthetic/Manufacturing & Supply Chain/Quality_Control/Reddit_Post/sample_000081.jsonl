{"unnormalised": "We've already recalibrated the weaving machines and adjusted the dye recipes, but the variations haven’t gone away completely. We're thinking of implementing a stricter sampling plan (1 in 5 rolls) and investing in automated inspection equipment (image analysis software). This will mean increased costs - around Rs. 5 Lakhs initial investment and more manpower training. Our current warehouse space of 5000 sq ft is also proving inadequate for increased inspection.", "normalised": "We've already recalibrated the weaving machines and adjusted the dye recipes, but the variations haven’t gone away completely.
