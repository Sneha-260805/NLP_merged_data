We need more robust implementation and continuous improvement programs, particularly in M S M E s."}
{"unnormalised": "Firstly, while many firms like Tata Steel and Reliance Industries implement ISO 9001, the actual effectiveness sometimes lags behind. We need more robust implementation and continuous improvement programs, particularly in MSMEs.", "normalised": "Secondly, talent acquisition remains a hurdle. Finding qualified Q C engineers who understand statistical process control (S P C) and can operate sophisticated equipment is difficult, especially outside metro areas like Mumbai or Bangalore. Institutions like I I T-Madras are doing great work, but we need more regional focus."}

Holding suppliers accountable with stricter Q C requirements and regular audits, possibly incentivizing them with bonuses (e.g., rupee five thousand bonus for achieving near zero defects) can work wonders.
