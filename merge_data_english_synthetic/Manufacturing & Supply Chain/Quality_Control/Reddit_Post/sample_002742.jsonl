A significant portion of these rejections, about sixty percent, are related to dimensional inaccuracies and surface finish issues, according to our initial analysis. Our current Quality Control process involves visual inspection and basic dimensional checks using vernier calipers and micrometers, but it clearly isn't sufficient."}
