We're receiving batches with unacceptable levels of surface defects, particularly on machined aluminum parts destined for braking systems. Tolerance deviations are also a concern, we're seeing parts off by as much as zero point five millimeter in some cases."}

Any advice on incentivizing or enforcing stricter Q C measures? Perhaps sharing successful case studies of Q C implementation during peak season (like the production rush before Diwali) would help? We had to reject a whole consignment recently, which set our own production back significantly. It's like being offered a plate of stale biryani on Onam - completely unacceptable! Open to your thoughts and suggestions."}
