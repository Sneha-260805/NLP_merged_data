{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone,", "normalised": "I'm working on a project focusing on improving quality control in a Tiruppur-based garment export unit. We're seeing a higher-than-acceptable rate of returns from European clients, primarily due to stitching errors and fabric defects. Think misaligned seams, color bleeding after the first wash, and incorrect sizing labels."}

What Q C tools and strategies have you found effective in reducing defects and improving overall product quality? Any insights on training programs for operators (especially those coming from villages around Coimbatore) would be highly appreciated. We are planning a Kaizen event on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty five, so suggestions are welcome before that. The management (Mister Sharma and Missus Patel from I I T Madras alumni) are keen on achieving Six Sigma levels of quality by fifteenth August two thousand and twenty five. Let's discuss!"}
