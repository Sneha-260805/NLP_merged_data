Our current QC process involves a final inspection check at 17:00 hrs every day before dispatch. We have found this to be insufficient, particularly as we ramp up production to meet demand from Maruti Suzuki. We are also trying to align ourselves with global standards (e.g. ISO 9001:2015).", "normalised": "Currently, we rely heavily on visual inspection and limited destructive testing post-casting.

{"unnormalised": "We're considering implementing more advanced NDT methods like ultrasonic testing or X-ray radiography. Budget constraints are a concern, of course. We also want to explore statistical process control (SPC) charts to identify trends early on. Any recommendations on cost-effective NDT solutions or practical SPC implementation based on your experience would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps some IIT Delhi or IIM Ahmedabad graduates can provide expert inputs.", "normalised": "We're considering implementing more advanced N D T methods like ultrasonic testing or X-ray radiography.

Furthermore, we had a quality audit on 10/10/2023 that highlighted inconsistency in raw material from vendors near Faridabad. I'm particularly interested in strategies to improve supplier quality control too.
