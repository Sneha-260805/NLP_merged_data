Their main issue was a high defect rate in their exported bedsheets – inconsistent stitching, color bleeding, and incorrect dimensions (several were under the specified 90 sq ft). This was costing them Rs. 50,000+ per shipment in returns and damaging their reputation.", "normalised": "Recently, I consulted for a small textile manufacturer in Faridabad, Haryana.

What are your experiences with QC in your respective industries? What are some effective yet cost-efficient methods you've used? I'd be keen to hear your insights.
