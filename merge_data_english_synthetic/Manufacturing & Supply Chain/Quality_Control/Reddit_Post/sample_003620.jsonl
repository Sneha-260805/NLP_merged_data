We primarily supply stamped metal components to Tier 1 auto suppliers like Mahindra and Tata Motors.", "normalised": "Specifically, we are seeing an increase in dimensional inaccuracies (deviations of plus or minus zero point five millimeter) and surface finish defects (rupees roughness above acceptable limits). Our current process involves manual inspection of every twentieth component off the line by Mister Sharma, our foreman, with a final A Q L-based sampling inspection before dispatch. However, the defects are often caught only after shipment, leading to rejects and angry calls from Chennai."}

What Q C methods have you found effective in mitigating defects at the source? Are there any cost-effective S P C solutions or alternative approaches that you would recommend, especially for a small-to-medium sized enterprise operating in a approximately five thousand square feet facility? Any insights, case studies, or even vendor recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"}
