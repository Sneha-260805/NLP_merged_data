{"unnormalised": "Specifically, we're seeing an uptick in fabric defects like \"oil stains\" and \"shade variation\" after dyeing. Our standard AQL (Acceptable Quality Level) is 2.5, but the R.,s are increasing. The initial tests at the lab at PSG College of Technology are fine. But some defects are only visible after cutting and stitching, costing us significantly in rework and delays.", "normalised": "Specifically, we're seeing an uptick in fabric defects like \"oil stains\" and \"shade variation\" after dyeing.
