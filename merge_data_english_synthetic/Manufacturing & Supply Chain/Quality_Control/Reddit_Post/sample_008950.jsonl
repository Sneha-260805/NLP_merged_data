{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm curious about best practices for managing supplier relationships. Are there specific clauses or performance metrics we should include in our contracts, ensuring consistent quality? Any insights into leveraging technology, like real-time data analysis, to preempt QC issues before they arise would also be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Meeting with the QC team on 26/01/2024 to discuss solutions. The supplier promised a better batch by 03/02/2024 at 14:00 hrs, let’s see. Anyone know what percentage of companies use 6 Sigma in the Delhi-NCR area?", "normalised": "Specifically, I am curious about best practices for managing supplier relationships.
