{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Namaste everyone, Been thinking a lot lately about the state of quality control Q C in our manufacturing sector, particularly in the context of Make in India. It's crucial for sustained growth and global competitiveness, right? We’ve seen instances where substandard products originating from, say, a plant near Surat, impact entire supply chains. Take, for example, a recent batch of steel from a vendor experiencing issues - five percent defect rate leading to delays for a construction project in Delhi. That's simply unacceptable. What Q C strategies are you finding most effective? Are you leveraging Six Sigma principles, perhaps lean manufacturing techniques rooted in kaizen, or strictly adhering to I S O nine thousand one to two thousand fifteen standards? We had a major audit at our Bangalore facility on twenty sixth january two thousand and twenty four, and the auditor, Mister Sharma, stressed the need for proactive rather than reactive Q C. Furthermore, how are you incorporating technology – A I-powered inspection, real-time data analytics – to improve Q C? I'm attending a webinar on this topic tomorrow at eleven thirty hours, organized by I I T Madras. R., a colleague working with textiles near Tiruppur, mentioned using advanced camera systems to detect fabric flaws. Apparently improved defect detection by thirty percent. What about employee training? Are you investing in upskilling your workforce in Q C methodologies? It's crucial, especially as automation increases. I remember Missus Patel emphasising continuous learning on second october two thousand and twenty three. Looking forward to a productive discussion and sharing best practices. Jai Hind!"}
