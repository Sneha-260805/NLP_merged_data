{"unnormalised": "I'm keen to discuss the evolving landscape of quality control (QC) in Indian manufacturing, particularly within supply chains. My experience working with various SMEs in and around Chennai has highlighted some recurring themes.", "normalised": "Firstly, traceability. How effectively are we tracking materials from source to finished product? I have seen instances where identifying the root cause of defects originating from, say, a supplier in Rajkot, becomes a logistical nightmare. Implementing robust lot tracking, akin to the systems Reliance Industries uses, is crucial."}

Upskilling initiatives focusing on modern tools like statistical process control and automated inspection systems (using A I slash M L) are vital. Institutions like I I T Madras are offering relevant courses, but adoption is slow."}

Upskilling initiatives focusing on modern tools like statistical process control (SPC) and automated inspection systems (using AI/ML) are vital.

Building strong relationships with suppliers and ensuring they adhere to stringent Quality Control standards is paramount. Regular audits, starting promptly at nine hundred hours every Monday, focusing on process adherence, have proven beneficial. Remember, a single compromised component from a vendor in, say, Meerut, can halt an entire production line."}
