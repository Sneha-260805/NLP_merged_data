Has anyone successfully implemented similar tech, perhaps from I I T Madras or similar Indian institution? Also, we are considering revising our supplier agreements to include stricter Quality Control clauses and penalties for non-compliance, effective from first January two thousand and twenty four. Furthermore, we are facing difficulty in managing material defects from suppliers in Ludhiana. Any advice on handling supplier Quality Control audits effectively?"}
