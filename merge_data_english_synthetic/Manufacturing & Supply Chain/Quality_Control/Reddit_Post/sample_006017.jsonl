{"unnormalised": "Firstly, finding skilled QC personnel is proving difficult. Many graduates from institutions like IIT Delhi or NIT Trichy prefer roles in software or finance, leaving a talent gap in core manufacturing. Secondly, maintaining consistent raw material quality, especially with supplies coming from various vendors across India, is a constant struggle. For example, a recent shipment of cotton from Andhra Pradesh on 10/10/2024 had significant variations in fiber length, impacting fabric strength.", "normalised": "Firstly, finding skilled Quality Control personnel is proving difficult.

Any experience with successful QC automation or innovative vendor management practices? Also, does anyone have experience using AI-powered QC solutions in their plants? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Our next QC meeting is scheduled for 15/11/2024 at 09:00 hrs, and I need to present some actionable solutions. Dhanyavaad!", "normalised": "What are some strategies you've found effective in addressing these challenges, especially within the context of \"Make in India\" and increasing global competitiveness?
