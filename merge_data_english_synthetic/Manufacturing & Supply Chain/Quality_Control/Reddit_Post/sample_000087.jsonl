Lately, I've seen some recurring issues creeping up, even with established vendors. We're talking about defects that impact form, fit, and function, even after rigorous inspection at their end. It feels like a breakdown in process control, potentially due to increasing demand and pressure to ramp up production.", "normalised": "Been working in Q C for a while now, primarily in automotive components manufacturing in the Chennai area.
