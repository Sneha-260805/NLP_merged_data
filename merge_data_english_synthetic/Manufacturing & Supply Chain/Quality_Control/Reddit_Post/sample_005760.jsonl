This directly impacts the fabric’s GSM and subsequent garment durability. Any thoughts on standardizing vendor selection procedures?", "normalised": "Firstly, sourcing raw materials.

Currently, our checklists cover stitching errors, colour fastness (critical for export orders), and dimensional accuracy (especially important for sizes L, XL, XXL). However, we're seeing instances where issues slip through, leading to rework and delays, impacting timelines, costing around Rs. 50,000 per incident.", "normalised": "Secondly, the implementation of Q C checklists.
