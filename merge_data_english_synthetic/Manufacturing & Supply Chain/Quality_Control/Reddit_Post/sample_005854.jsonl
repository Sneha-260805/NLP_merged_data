Recently, we faced a significant setback at our Tiruppur based garment export unit, \"Shanti Exports.\" A large shipment destined for the U K was rejected due to inconsistent stitching quality and fabric dye variations. This incident cost us substantial rupees and damaged our reputation."}

We have a cutting floor of approximately five thousand square feet and handle about fifty thousand pieces monthly. Current quality control relies heavily on visual inspections by seasoned supervisors (R. Sharma being our oldest and most experienced), but clearly, it is not enough."}

Any advice on training our existing workforce on these new methods? I am particularly interested in minimizing disruption to our current production flow."}
