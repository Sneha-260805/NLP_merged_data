If your raw materials from Ranchi are substandard, your finished product will inevitably suffer. Build strong partnerships with suppliers and help them improve their own Q C processes. It's about raising the entire ecosystem. Remember the 'Make in India' initiative - Q C is at its heart. Costs are inevitable, but bad Q C incurs rupees thousands of cost for fixing it, but good Q C can prevent it!"}
