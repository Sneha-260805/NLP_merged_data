Whether you're churning out Aloo Samosas in Chandni Chowk or manufacturing aircraft components for H A L, Q C is paramount. It's not just about catching defects; it's about building trust and ensuring customer satisfaction, from Delhi to Kanyakumari."}

We're talking dimensional checks, material testing, functionality tests - the works. Think about the stringent testing a new Maruti Suzuki goes through before leaving the Manesar plant."}
