{"unnormalised": "Our current QC process involves visual inspection and random CMM checks post-machining, happening around 17:00 hrs daily. We’ve implemented SPC, but the data suggests instability; a constant stream of \"assignable causes,\" mostly attributed to operator error and machine calibration drift. This is costing us significant Rupees and damaging our reputation. Last week alone (week ending 20/10/2024), we scrapped almost 1500 units.", "normalised": "Our current Q C process involves visual inspection and random C M M checks post-machining, happening around seventeen hundred hours daily.
