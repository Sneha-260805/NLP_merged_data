{"unnormalised": "Has anyone here implemented similar quality control systems in an Indian manufacturing environment? Any recommendations on specific methodologies or vendors (especially those with experience in the auto component sector)? Also, any advice on training programs for our existing workforce? Many of my team members are graduates of the IIT Delhi or have similar qualifications, but it is still difficult to get them onboard with the newest ideas sometimes. Also, if anyone has experience working with government schemes (like the ones offered by the MSME Ministry) that could subsidize quality improvement initiatives, please share your insights. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
