{"unnormalised": "Recently, we've faced increased pressure to reduce defects, especially with tighter deadlines. The traditional \"end-of-line\" inspection, while still crucial, seems insufficient. I believe implementing statistical process control (SPC) and incorporating in-process checks would be beneficial. Has anyone successfully implemented SPC in similar scenarios, particularly in industries like garment manufacturing or metal fabrication (think auto-ancillaries in Pune)?", "normalised": "Recently, we have faced increased pressure to reduce defects, especially with tighter deadlines.
