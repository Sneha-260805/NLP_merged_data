{"unnormalised": "One major hurdle is maintaining consistent quality standards across Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. Smaller units, often family-run businesses, may lack the resources or expertise to implement robust QC processes like those used by companies like Tata Steel or Bharat Forge. This impacts the final product, leading to higher scrap rates and potential delays. We received a shipment from a vendor in Faridabad on 26/01/2023, and 15% of the parts were defective; a classic case.", "normalised": "One major hurdle is maintaining consistent quality standards across Tier two and Tier three suppliers.

While institutions like IIT Bombay and NIT Trichy are producing excellent engineers, practical application of QC methodologies, especially in the context of rapid production cycles, needs more focus.
