{"unnormalised": "Facing a particularly frustrating period with quality control at our Faridabad automotive component plant. We manufacture precision parts, and recently, rejection rates have spiked. We're seeing a higher incidence of dimensional inaccuracies (up to 2mm deviation in some cases!), surface finish defects, and even some material composition issues.", "normalised": "Facing a particularly frustrating period with quality control at our Faridabad automotive component plant.

Another batch on 12/11/2024 at 17:30 hrs showed significant porosity. These parts are critical for a major client, Mahindra & Mahindra, so it's a serious situation.", "normalised": "Specifically, we had a batch flagged on first november two thousand and twenty four around fourteen hundred hours because of incorrect heat treatment parameters affecting tensile strength.

{"unnormalised": "Anyone else dealt with similar spikes in defects? What strategies have you found effective? Perhaps bolstering our in-process inspections? We also need to retrain our operators - thinking of bringing in Mr. Sharma from Tata Steel for a workshop. Any advice is appreciated! We're trying to get this under control by 22/11/2024.
