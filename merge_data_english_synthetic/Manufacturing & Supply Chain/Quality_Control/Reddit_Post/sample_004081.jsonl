{"unnormalised": "For example, a recent batch of bearings from a vendor in Nashik exhibited defects in approximately 10% of the lot, which, unacceptable. Our QC team flagged it on 27/07/2024, but the initial batch still made it onto the shop floor because production was under pressure to meet the quarterly targets set by the board on 15/08/2023. It seems like the \"Chalta Hai\" attitude might be creeping in, costing us more in the long run through warranty claims and reputational damage.", "normalised": "For example, a recent batch of bearings from a vendor in Nashik exhibited defects in approximately ten percent of the lot, which, unacceptable.

{"unnormalised": "I recall during my engineering days at IIT Bombay, the emphasis was always on rigorous testing and zero defects. Where has that gone? Does anyone else feel the pressure to compromise on QC to meet unrealistic timelines or cost constraints? What are your strategies for maintaining high QC standards, especially when dealing with fluctuating demand or new vendors in the supply chain? Also, can anyone recommend a good online resource or certification focused on Six Sigma or similar QC methodologies applicable in the Indian context? Maybe something offered by the Indian Statistical Institute?", "normalised": "I recall during my engineering days at I I T Bombay, the emphasis was always on rigorous testing and zero defects.
