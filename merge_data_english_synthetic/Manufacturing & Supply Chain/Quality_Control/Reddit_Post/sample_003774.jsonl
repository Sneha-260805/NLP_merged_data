{"unnormalised": "One major issue is inconsistent raw material quality from suppliers in places like Surat and Bhiwandi. A batch received on 26/01/2024 had a yarn count variance of +/- 5%, way outside acceptable tolerances. Another issue is training; many QC inspectors lack formal qualifications, relying on experience alone, which leads to subjective assessments. We're aiming to implement standardized checklists and training programs based on Lean Manufacturing principles by 15/07/2024.", "normalised": "One major issue is inconsistent raw material quality from suppliers in places like Surat and Bhiwandi.

Any insights on affordable and effective QC technology solutions that could be implemented by 09:00 hrs, 01/06/2024, would be greatly appreciated. Are there any known cases similar to the famous Tata Nano quality issues of the past? Recommendations for institutions like the IIT Madras for QC training are also welcomed.
