{"unnormalised": "At my company, based near Pune, we've been facing increasing pressure to meet stricter international standards while keeping costs competitive. We manufacture components for the automotive industry, and even minor defects can lead to significant recalls. For example, one batch we produced around 26/01/2024 had slightly off dimensions that slipped through the initial QC checks.", "normalised": "At my company, based near Pune, we have been facing increasing pressure to meet stricter international standards while keeping costs competitive.

{"unnormalised": "Another concern is the variability in raw material quality from suppliers. We source steel from various vendors across India and ensuring consistent material properties is a battle. Has anyone else faced this, and what strategies have you found effective? We are trying to transition towards more blockchain-based supply chain visibility.
