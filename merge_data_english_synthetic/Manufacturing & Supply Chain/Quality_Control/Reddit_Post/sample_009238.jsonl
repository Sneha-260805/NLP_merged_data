I often find that training, particularly for floor-level workers in units around places like Coimbatore or Ludhiana, can be a major hurdle. How do we effectively train workers who may not have formal engineering backgrounds to understand statistical process control (S P C)? Is relying on simple visual inspections, like checking if the stitching is straight on a sari border (happens more often than you think!), enough in today's competitive market?"}
