{"unnormalised": "Namaste everyone,", "normalised": "I'm looking to spark a discussion around quality control practices, particularly amongst Tier two suppliers in the Indian automotive sector. We've been facing some persistent issues with components sourced from vendors near Pune, specifically related to dimensional accuracy and material consistency. These problems are causing delays and increasing rework at our assembly plant in Chennai."}

We had to reject the entire lot, impacting our production schedule significantly. Initial analysis pointed to inadequate calibration of their injection molding machines and inconsistent raw material sourcing. Another issue surfaced on tenth May two thousand and twenty four; concerning metal fatigue in critical brackets delivered at two o’clock post meridiem."}

Sharma and Sons, claims they’re using statistical process control, but the data they provide seems unreliable. Is there a reliable, cost-effective software solution you'd recommend for real-time Quality Control data collection and analysis suitable for smaller manufacturers? Any insights into effective Supplier Quality Engineering practices, especially in addressing issues stemming from \"jugaad\" engineering approaches, would be highly appreciated. We need a long-term solution. We had another delay yesterday at five o’clock post meridiem."}
