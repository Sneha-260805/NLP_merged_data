{"unnormalised": "We've seen major improvements implementing a risk-based audit approach. Instead of auditing every process for every vendor, we prioritize based on factors like spend (Rs. 50 Lakh+ vendors get prioritized), criticality of component (engine parts vs. interior trim), and past performance.", "normalised": "we've seen major improvements implementing a risk-based audit approach. instead of auditing every process for every vendor, we prioritize based on factors like spend (rupees fifty lakh plus vendors get prioritized), criticality of component (engine parts versus interior trim), and past performance."}
