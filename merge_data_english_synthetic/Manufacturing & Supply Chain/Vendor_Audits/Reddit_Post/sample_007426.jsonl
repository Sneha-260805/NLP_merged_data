We’re thinking of adding a responsiveness metric (time taken to address NCRs, etc.). Any tips for making these audits less of a \"gotcha\" exercise and more of a collaborative improvement process? Also, anyone working with Indian universities (like IIT Madras) for vendor training programs? Looking to benchmark. Your insights are highly appreciated!
