{"unnormalised": "Common findings: inaccurate calibration of measuring instruments, inadequate worker training, and insufficient storage of raw materials (leading to rust on some steel sheets - a big no-no!). We observed issues with dimensional accuracy (tolerances off by 0.5mm on some parts). The factory floor layout wasn’t optimal; wasted space of ~200 sq ft.
