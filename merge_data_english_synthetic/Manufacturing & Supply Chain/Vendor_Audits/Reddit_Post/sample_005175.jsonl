What K P Is do you track during your audits beyond just price? We focus on things like lead time adherence, defect rates (P P M), and responsiveness to corrective action requests (C A Rs). I'm especially interested in hearing about best practices for auditing food suppliers, with Onam season coming up, ensuring the quality of ingredients for all the festive biryani is paramount. Any thoughts on using technology to streamline the auditing process? Any tips are appreciated. Our team at I I T Madras is studying this topic too. Let's discuss!"}
