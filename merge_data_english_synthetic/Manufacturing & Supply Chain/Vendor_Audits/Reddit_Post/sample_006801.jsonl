Vendor audits – a topic as vital as chai breaks during a long shift, but often just as overlooked until things go horribly wrong. We're seeing increasing pressure from clients (including our export partners in the E U and U S) to tighten our vendor quality control, and I'm curious about your best practices."}

Are you performing annual audits, or more frequent spot checks, especially for critical components? How much weightage do you give to I S O certifications versus on-site observations? For example, we recently audited a supplier in Faridabad producing gears; they had the certification, but their five S was…lacking. The dust buildup in their two thousand square feet facility was concerning."}
