We recently had a supplier in Bangalore ship us a batch with a significant deviation from the agreed-upon tensile strength – one thousand two hundred M P A instead of one thousand four hundred M P A. Cost us a week and a fair bit of reputation damage, as we had to recall a small batch destined for Delhi."}

Any advice on streamlining the audit process while still ensuring rigor? We also offer a scrumptious biryani post-audit (pass or fail!). Any tips for getting more accurate data during audits, particularly around inventory management and traceability of raw materials like steel coils measured in metric tons? Let's discuss. I'm keen to learn from your insights!"}
