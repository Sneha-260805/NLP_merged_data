{"unnormalised": "So, what does a vendor audit entail? Typically, it involves a team (maybe someone from your QA department, like Ms. Sharma, a stickler for detail) visiting the vendor's facility in, say, Faridabad. They’ll review documentation, observe production processes, and interview personnel. This might include scrutinizing ISO 9001 certifications, verifying adherence to safety standards (like BIS standards), and checking for ethical labour practices. We often start planning audits well in advance, say, 6 weeks before Onam, to avoid disrupting production schedules.", "normalised": "So, what does a vendor audit entail?
