{"unnormalised": "Why are they so important? Well, poor quality components from a supplier in, say, Faridabad can halt production lines in Chennai. A substandard shipment of raw materials can lead to costly recalls and damage your brand reputation. Regular audits mitigate these risks by identifying potential weaknesses and areas for improvement before they impact your operations.", "normalised": "Why are they so important?
