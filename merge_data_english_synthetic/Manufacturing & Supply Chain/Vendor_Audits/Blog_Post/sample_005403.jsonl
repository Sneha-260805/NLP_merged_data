{"unnormalised": "In today's interconnected global market, manufacturers in India and beyond rely heavily on a robust supply chain. Maintaining the quality and reliability of this chain hinges significantly on rigorous vendor audits. A vendor audit is a systematic, independent, and documented process for evaluating a supplier's capabilities, processes, and adherence to agreed-upon standards and regulations. It’s about more than just ticking boxes; it's about building a strong, transparent, and mutually beneficial partnership.", "normalised": "in today's interconnected global market, manufacturers in India and beyond rely heavily on a robust supply chain. maintaining the quality and reliability of this chain hinges significantly on rigorous vendor audits. a vendor audit is a systematic, independent, and documented process for evaluating a supplier's capabilities, processes, and adherence to agreed upon standards and regulations. it's about more than just ticking boxes; it's about building a strong, transparent, and mutually beneficial partnership."}
{"unnormalised": "Why are vendor audits so crucial? For one, they minimize risks. A comprehensive audit can identify potential bottlenecks, quality control lapses, or non-compliance issues *before* they impact your production line. Imagine a scenario where a supplier of raw materials in Kolkata experiences a breakdown in their quality control process. Without regular audits, your Mumbai-based manufacturing unit might unknowingly receive substandard materials, leading to product defects and costly recalls.", "normalised": "why are vendor audits so crucial? for one, they minimize risks. a comprehensive audit can identify potential bottlenecks, quality control lapses, or non compliance issues before they impact your production line. imagine a scenario where a supplier of raw materials in Kolkata experiences a breakdown in their quality control process. without regular audits, your Mumbai based manufacturing unit might unknowingly receive substandard materials, leading to product defects and costly recalls."}
