{"unnormalised": "A vendor audit is a systematic and independent evaluation of a supplier's processes, infrastructure, and quality control mechanisms. Its purpose is to assess whether the supplier can consistently meet your organization's requirements and adhere to agreed-upon standards. Imagine a saree manufacturer in Surat relying on fabric suppliers in Ahmedabad. If the fabric isn't up to par, the entire batch of sarees is compromised.", "normalised": "A vendor audit is a systematic and independent evaluation of a supplier's processes, infrastructure, and quality control mechanisms.

{"unnormalised": "Why are vendor audits so critical? Firstly, they help identify potential risks before they impact your production. Think about material defects, inconsistent quality, or even compliance issues. Detecting these early on can save you from costly recalls and production delays. Secondly, vendor audits foster continuous improvement. By providing constructive feedback, you encourage your vendors to enhance their processes and performance.", "normalised": "Why are vendor audits so critical?

{"unnormalised": "What does a vendor audit typically cover? Expect scrutiny of their manufacturing processes, quality management system (often benchmarked against ISO 9001 standards or perhaps even a more stringent standard like IATF 16949 in the automotive sector), inventory management, and adherence to ethical and environmental regulations. A good auditor might even ask about their employee training programs and workplace safety.", "normalised": "What does a vendor audit typically cover?

{"unnormalised": "Successful vendor audits require careful planning and execution. Start by clearly defining your objectives and scope. Select qualified auditors, perhaps even graduates from prestigious institutions like IIT Madras with expertise in manufacturing engineering. Create a detailed audit checklist tailored to your industry and specific needs. After the audit, provide your vendor with a comprehensive report and work collaboratively to address any findings. Don't aim for \"3 Idiots\" levels of perfection; aim for consistent improvement. Regular vendor audits, perhaps every 6 months or 1 year depending on risk profile, are vital for ensuring a robust and resilient supply chain, and ultimately, delivering high-quality products to your customers. Remember, a strong vendor is a strong business!", "normalised": "Successful vendor audits require careful planning and execution. Start by clearly defining your objectives and scope.
