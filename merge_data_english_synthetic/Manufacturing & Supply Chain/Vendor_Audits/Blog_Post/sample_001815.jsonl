{"unnormalised": "Vendor audits involve a systematic evaluation of a supplier's capabilities, processes, and performance. This can range from assessing their manufacturing facilities in places like Gurgaon or Hosur to reviewing their documentation and quality control procedures. Imagine ordering biryani from a new vendor for a big office Onam celebration - you'd want to make sure they have the proper hygiene standards and food safety certifications, right? Similarly, in manufacturing, we need that assurance.", "normalised": "Vendor audits involve a systematic evaluation of a supplier's capabilities, processes, and performance.

This could involve a visit to their factory, perhaps located 50 km outside Mumbai, or a desk-based review of their records. The cost of an audit, typically around Rs. 25,000- Rs. 50,000, is a small price to pay compared to the potential losses from a faulty product or a supply chain disruption.", "normalised": "Regular audits, say, every six months or annually, depending on the risk profile of the vendor, are crucial.
