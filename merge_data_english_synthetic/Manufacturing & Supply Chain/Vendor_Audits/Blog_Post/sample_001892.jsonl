{"unnormalised": "Imagine a biryani, a dish celebrated across India. The quality of the biryani depends on the quality of each ingredient - the basmati rice sourced from Haryana, the spices from Kerala, and the meat from the local butcher. Similarly, the quality of your manufactured product depends on the quality of materials and components supplied by your vendors. A vendor audit is like inspecting each ingredient before it goes into the dish.", "normalised": "Imagine a biryani, a dish celebrated across India.

{"unnormalised": "What exactly does a vendor audit entail? Typically, it involves a detailed assessment of a vendor's facilities, processes, and documentation. This could include evaluating their quality management system (ISO 9001 compliance, for example), their adherence to safety standards (as per regulations by the Bureau of Indian Standards), and their ethical sourcing practices (ensuring no child labour, fair wages, etc.). Consider a vendor in Tiruchirappalli supplying critical components for automotive manufacturing. An audit would verify their adherence to IATF 16949 standards.", "normalised": "What exactly does a vendor audit entail?

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, a successful vendor audit goes beyond mere compliance. It fosters transparency and collaboration between the manufacturer and the vendor. This, in turn, strengthens the relationship and allows for continuous improvement. For example, after an audit, a vendor in Ludhiana might implement a new process that reduces defects by 10%, benefiting both parties.", "normalised": "Moreover, a successful vendor audit goes beyond mere compliance.

{"unnormalised": "During Onam, when communities come together to celebrate prosperity, it’s a good time to reflect on the health and stability of your supply chain. Are your vendors operating efficiently and ethically? Investing in vendor audits is an investment in your company's long-term success and reputation. R. Kumar, a Quality Manager from a manufacturing unit in Pune, highlights the importance of scheduling audits at least once a year, or more frequently depending on the criticality of the components supplied. Remember to keep records, perhaps in an excel sheet, of the last audit dates and relevant findings!", "normalised": "During Onam, when communities come together to celebrate prosperity, it’s a good time to reflect on the health and stability of your supply chain.
