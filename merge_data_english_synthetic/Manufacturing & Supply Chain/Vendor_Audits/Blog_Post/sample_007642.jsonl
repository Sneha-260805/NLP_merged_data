{"unnormalised": "Vendor audits are systematic assessments of your suppliers' capabilities, processes, and performance. They help you identify potential risks, ensure adherence to quality standards (like ISO 9001), and improve overall supply chain resilience. Imagine Rajesh, the owner of a textile factory in Surat supplying to your apparel manufacturing unit in Bangalore.

{"unnormalised": "Implementing a robust vendor audit program involves several key steps: Defining clear audit criteria, scheduling regular audits, conducting thorough assessments, and implementing corrective action plans. Remember, a strong supply chain built on trust and transparency, secured through rigorous audits, is essential for long-term success.
