{"unnormalised": "Vendor audits are essentially systematic assessments of your suppliers' capabilities and performance. The process can range from simple document reviews to comprehensive on-site inspections. We recently conducted an audit of a supplier in Surat, Gujarat, specializing in textile dyes. The initial document review revealed discrepancies in their material sourcing documentation. An on-site visit confirmed our suspicions, revealing that certain raw materials were not meeting the agreed-upon specifications. This could have severely impacted the quality of our finished goods.", "normalised": "Vendor audits are essentially systematic assessments of your suppliers' capabilities and performance.

Are they adhering to fair wages for their workers, ensuring safe working conditions (as per the Factories Act, 1948), and disposing of waste responsibly? These considerations are becoming increasingly important to consumers and stakeholders alike.", "normalised": "These audits should cover a wide range of areas, including quality management systems (I S O nine thousand one certifications are a good starting point), manufacturing processes, labor practices, and environmental compliance.

{"unnormalised": "Conducting regular vendor audits helps identify potential risks before they escalate. It allows you to proactively address issues like substandard materials, production delays, or ethical violations. For example, imagine relying on a spice vendor from Kerala who, due to poor farming practices, provides adulterated cardamom for your famous biryani spice blend. The resulting backlash could be devastating.", "normalised": "Conducting regular vendor audits helps identify potential risks before they escalate.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it as investing in the long-term health of your supply chain. A well-structured vendor audit program, conducted perhaps by a qualified agency like FICCI, can help you build strong, reliable relationships with your suppliers and ensure the consistent delivery of high-quality products. This includes confirming their adherence to statutory norms and applicable GST regulations. Recently, our audits saved us Rs. 5,00,000 by identifying overbilling errors. Schedule those audits; the cost is minimal compared to the risk of non-compliance. Also, it could prevent supply chain disruptions around festivals like Onam!", "normalised": "Think of it as investing in the long-term health of your supply chain.
