{"unnormalised": "Vendor audits are systematic and independent evaluations of a supplier’s operations. They assess a range of factors, including quality control procedures, adherence to regulatory standards, ethical sourcing practices, and even financial stability.

{"unnormalised": "The audit process often involves reviewing documentation, conducting on-site inspections, and interviewing personnel. Post-audit, a report is generated outlining findings and recommendations. Corrective action plans (CAPs) are then implemented to address any identified deficiencies. For instance, a pharmaceutical company sourcing ingredients from a supplier near Pune might require the supplier to invest Rs. 5 lakhs in upgrading its sterilization equipment after an audit. The key is to follow up on CAPs diligently. Remember, a robust vendor audit program is not just about ticking boxes; it’s about building strong, reliable, and ethical supply chains.", "normalised": "The audit process often involves reviewing documentation, conducting on-site inspections, and interviewing personnel.
