They review documentation, observe production processes, interview staff, and inspect facilities. They might check raw material sourcing, manufacturing techniques, storage conditions, and quality control measures. Think detailed inventory checks, scrutinizing batch numbers, and verifying certifications, perhaps even after a delightful Onam sadhya.", "normalised": "During an audit, a team (perhaps internal auditors or a third-party firm) visits the vendor's location.

They cost money, yes, perhaps Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 200,000 depending on the scope, but the cost of a compromised product or a supply chain disruption could be significantly higher. Distance is a factor too – auditing a vendor 2000 km away will be more expensive than one nearby.", "normalised": "Investing in regular vendor audits is an investment in your business’s long-term success and sustainability.
