{"unnormalised": "A vendor audit is a systematic and independent examination of a vendor's facilities, processes, and quality management systems. Think of it as a quality check, much like the IIT entrance exam, but for suppliers. The aim?

If that vendor isn't following proper harvesting and drying techniques, the efficacy of your final product could be compromised.

{"unnormalised": "What does a typical vendor audit involve? It usually includes a review of documentation (like ISO 9001 certification, if applicable), on-site inspections, and interviews with staff. The auditor might look at everything from raw material storage to equipment maintenance and even worker safety. For example, verifying that a steel supplier in Jamshedpur is using the correct quenching process and has documented it appropriately.", "normalised": "What does a typical vendor audit involve?

{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: you wouldn’t blindly trust the quality of the *lassi* from that roadside stall without a little scrutiny, right? Similarly, vendor audits are about mitigating risk and ensuring your entire supply chain is operating at peak performance. A well-conducted audit can identify areas for improvement, leading to stronger vendor relationships, reduced costs (potentially saving Rs. 5 lakhs per annum!), and a higher quality product that keeps your customers happy. In the end, much like the plot of *3 Idiots*, chasing excellence pays off. It's about building a robust supply chain, one audit at a time.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: you wouldn’t blindly trust the quality of the lassi from that roadside stall without a little scrutiny, right?
