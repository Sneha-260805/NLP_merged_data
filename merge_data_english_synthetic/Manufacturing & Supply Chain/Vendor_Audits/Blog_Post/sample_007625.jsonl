{"unnormalised": "Vendor audits are systematic and independent assessments of a vendor's processes, facilities, and systems against predefined criteria, like ISO 9001:2015. They help identify potential risks and areas for improvement. Consider a vendor supplying steel components to an automotive manufacturer in Chennai. An audit might reveal inconsistencies in the steel's tensile strength compared to the agreed-upon specifications, potentially leading to safety hazards.", "normalised": "vendor audits are systematic and independent assessments of a vendor's processes, facilities, and systems against predefined criteria, like I S O nine thousand one: two thousand and fifteen. they help identify potential risks and areas for improvement. consider a vendor supplying steel components to an automotive manufacturer in Chennai. an audit might reveal inconsistencies in the steel's tensile strength compared to the agreed upon specifications, potentially leading to safety hazards."}

{"unnormalised": "The audit process typically involves document review, on-site inspections, and interviews with vendor personnel. A detailed report is then prepared highlighting findings, areas of non-compliance, and recommended corrective actions. Implementing a robust vendor audit program can significantly mitigate risks and improve the overall supply chain performance. This is especially critical during peak production seasons leading up to festivals like Onam, where increased demand can sometimes compromise quality control. Investing in thorough audits, even costing a few thousand Rs., can prevent losses running into lakhs down the line. Remember, a proactive approach to vendor management ensures consistent quality and strengthens your competitive advantage. Furthermore, consider regular performance reviews beyond audits, possibly involving performance metrics (e.g. defect rate per 1000 km traveled by shipments).", "normalised": "the audit process typically involves document review, on site inspections, and interviews with vendor personnel. a detailed report is then prepared highlighting findings, areas of non compliance, and recommended corrective actions. implementing a robust vendor audit program can significantly mitigate risks and improve the overall supply chain performance. this is especially critical during peak production seasons leading up to festivals like Onam, where increased demand can sometimes compromise quality control. investing in thorough audits, even costing a few thousand rupees, can prevent losses running into lakhs down the line. remember, a proactive approach to vendor management ensures consistent quality and strengthens your competitive advantage. furthermore, consider regular performance reviews beyond audits, possibly involving performance metrics (for example defect rate per one thousand kilometer traveled by shipments)."}
