{"unnormalised": "What exactly *is* a vendor audit? Simply put, it's a systematic assessment of a vendor's processes, procedures, and facilities to ensure they meet our requirements. This could range from scrutinizing the quality of raw materials sourced from, say, a quarry near Udaipur, to evaluating their adherence to environmental regulations. Dates, figures, and compliance documents are all fair game!", "normalised": "What exactly *is* a vendor audit?

Imagine a batch of sarees destined for export being ruined by substandard dye – a vendor audit beforehand could have prevented this disaster. Secondly, they mitigate risk. A supplier struggling with its finances, for instance, might compromise on quality to cut costs. An audit could flag these vulnerabilities before they impact our operations.", "normalised": "Why are these audits so important? Firstly, they safeguard product quality.
