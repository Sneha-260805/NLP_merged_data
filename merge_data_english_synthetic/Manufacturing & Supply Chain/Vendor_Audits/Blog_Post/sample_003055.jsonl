{"unnormalised": "Why are vendor audits important, especially in the Indian context? Firstly, they mitigate risks. Imagine a critical component failing in your machine, leading to downtime and lost revenue. A vendor audit could have identified deficiencies in their quality control processes preventing such a scenario. Secondly, they foster transparency. Building a strong, trust-based relationship with your vendors is crucial. A clear audit process ensures both parties are on the same page regarding expectations.", "normalised": "Why are vendor audits important, especially in the Indian context?

Internal quality checks kept catching the flaws, delaying production and increasing costs. After implementing regular vendor audits, focusing on process adherence and raw material sourcing, the issues drastically reduced. They even consulted experts from the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) to improve the audit parameters.", "normalised": "Think about a case study.
