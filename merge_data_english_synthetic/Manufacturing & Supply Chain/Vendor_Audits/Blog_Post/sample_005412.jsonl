{"unnormalised": "Why are vendor audits so crucial, especially in the context of Indian manufacturing? For starters, they help ensure compliance with Indian regulations and standards, like those mandated by BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards). Imagine sourcing components from a vendor in, say, Coimbatore, and finding out during an audit that they are not adhering to the required quality control processes. This could lead to significant recalls and reputational damage.", "normalised": "Why are vendor audits so crucial, especially in the context of Indian manufacturing?
