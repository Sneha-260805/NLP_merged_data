{"unnormalised": "In today's complex global manufacturing landscape, particularly here in India, vendor audits are no longer optional; they're critical for maintaining quality, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance across the supply chain. Imagine a manufacturer in Coimbatore relying on components from suppliers across India, from Faridabad to Kolkata. Without robust vendor audits, how can they guarantee that those components meet the required specifications and ethical standards?", "normalised": "In today's complex global manufacturing landscape, particularly here in India, vendor audits are no longer optional; they're critical for maintaining quality, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance across the supply chain.

{"unnormalised": "A vendor audit is essentially a systematic, independent evaluation of a supplier's capabilities and performance. This can encompass everything from quality management systems (QMS) like ISO 9001, to adherence to environmental regulations, and even ethical labour practices. Think of it like a thorough inspection of a biryani – ensuring all the ingredients are fresh, the cooking process is hygienic, and the final product is delicious and safe for consumption.", "normalised": "A vendor audit is essentially a systematic, independent evaluation of a supplier's capabilities and performance.

For example, an audit might verify the calibration of equipment used to measure dimensions with an accuracy of +/- 0.01mm. We might be checking if a supplier is using outdated technology or if their processes deviate from the approved method outlined in document ref. SC-007 dated 15/08/2023.", "normalised": "Here in India, the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (N A B L) provides accreditation services relevant to many manufacturing processes, influencing audit criteria.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits are manifold. Vendor audits help identify potential risks before they materialize into costly problems like defective products or supply chain disruptions. They also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, protecting a company's reputation and avoiding potential fines.", "normalised": "The benefits are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "Consider Rajesh, a Quality Manager at a textile manufacturing unit in Surat. Through vendor audits, Rajesh discovered a supplier was using substandard dyes, leading to colour fading in the finished fabric. This early detection saved the company from a potentially devastating recall and damage to their brand. A thorough audit saved them Rs. 50,000 in rejected raw materials and prevented future losses.", "normalised": "Consider Rajesh, a Quality Manager at a textile manufacturing unit in Surat.
