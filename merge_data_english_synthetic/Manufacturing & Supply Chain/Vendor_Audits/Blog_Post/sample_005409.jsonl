{"unnormalised": "In today's interconnected global economy, manufacturers rely heavily on a complex web of vendors. From sourcing raw materials like steel from Jamshedpur to procuring specialized components from Faridabad, the integrity of the supply chain is paramount. Vendor audits are the unsung heroes ensuring this integrity. They’re not just a tick-box exercise; they’re critical for maintaining quality, minimizing risk, and fostering trust in your partnerships.", "normalised": "In today's interconnected global economy, manufacturers rely heavily on a complex web of vendors.

Similarly, you can't afford to gamble with substandard materials or unethical practices from your vendors. A comprehensive vendor audit allows you to assess a vendor's capabilities, adherence to quality standards (like ISO 9001), and compliance with regulations.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: you wouldn't risk serving stale biryani at an Onam celebration, would you?

{"unnormalised": "What does a typical vendor audit look like? It usually involves a review of documentation, on-site inspections of their manufacturing facilities (perhaps located 50 km outside of Chennai), and interviews with personnel. You'll be looking for things like consistent application of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), adherence to safety protocols, and traceability of materials. We often find discrepancies in material certifications which cost our clients upto Rs. 5,00,000 annually.", "normalised": "What does a typical vendor audit look like?

{"unnormalised": "Regular audits are also essential for identifying potential weaknesses in the supply chain. Maybe a vendor's equipment is aging and needs replacing, or perhaps their quality control processes need strengthening. Addressing these issues proactively can prevent costly disruptions and maintain a consistent flow of goods. We recommend conducting initial audits before onboarding a new vendor and then scheduling follow-up audits every 12-18 months.", "normalised": "Regular audits are also essential for identifying potential weaknesses in the supply chain.
