{"unnormalised": "The benefits of OTT partnerships extend beyond customer acquisition and retention. By bundling data with OTT subscriptions, telecom operators can increase data consumption, driving higher average revenue per user (ARPU). Furthermore, these partnerships can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior, allowing telecom companies to personalize their offerings and improve customer engagement. Imagine a user in Kochi watching Onam-related content – this data can be used to offer targeted promotions or suggest similar regional content.", "normalised": "The benefits of O T T partnerships extend beyond customer acquisition and retention.
