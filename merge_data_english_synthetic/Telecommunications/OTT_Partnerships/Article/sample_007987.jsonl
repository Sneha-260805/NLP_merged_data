{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, telecom companies like Airtel and Jio have focused on providing connectivity – the pipes through which data flows. However, consumers are increasingly demanding bundled services, combining connectivity with entertainment. This is where OTT partnerships become crucial. By bundling OTT subscriptions with data plans, telcos can offer a more compelling value proposition, attracting and retaining customers in a fiercely competitive market. For instance, a JioFiber plan bundled with Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar subscriptions becomes significantly more attractive than a standalone broadband connection.", "normalised": "Traditionally, telecom companies like Airtel and Jio have focused on providing connectivity – the pipes through which data flows.

{"unnormalised": "These partnerships are not merely about bundling. They offer opportunities for deeper integration. Telcos can leverage their data analytics capabilities to personalize content recommendations, improving user engagement on partner OTT platforms. Imagine Airtel recommending specific Bollywood movies on Zee5 based on a customer's viewing history and language preference. This level of personalization enhances the overall customer experience.", "normalised": "These partnerships are not merely about bundling. They offer opportunities for deeper integration.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, OTT partnerships can pave the way for new revenue models. Co-branded content initiatives, where telcos invest in original content production alongside OTT platforms, are gaining traction. This allows telcos to not only generate revenue from subscriptions but also from advertising and content licensing. A prime example would be Vi partnering with Eros Now to produce a web series targeted at the youth demographic.", "normalised": "Furthermore, O T T partnerships can pave the way for new revenue models.

{"unnormalised": "The cost implications of these partnerships can be significant, requiring careful negotiation and resource allocation. Telcos need to assess the cost of data usage, content acquisition, and marketing expenses, ensuring a positive return on investment. Launching campaigns in Tier-2 cities requires different budget allocations compared to metros like Mumbai and Delhi. A typical rural campaign might involve an initial investment of Rs. 50,000 for marketing materials covering a 100 sq ft area.", "normalised": "The cost implications of these partnerships can be significant, requiring careful negotiation and resource allocation.
