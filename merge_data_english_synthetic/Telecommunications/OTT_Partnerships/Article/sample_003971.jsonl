{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the exponential growth of Over-The-Top (OTT) media consumption. Telecom operators, historically focused on connectivity, are increasingly recognizing the strategic imperative of forging partnerships with OTT platforms to remain competitive and enhance customer value. This trend is particularly pronounced as data tariffs become increasingly commoditized, necessitating alternative revenue streams and customer loyalty programs.", "normalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the exponential growth of Over-The-Top (O T T) media consumption.

{"unnormalised": "One significant driver for these alliances is the surging demand for digital entertainment across India. With rising internet penetration, even in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities like Lucknow and Patna, consumers are increasingly accessing video content via their smartphones. This creates a substantial opportunity for telecom operators to capitalize on this burgeoning demand by offering bundled OTT services, thereby attracting new subscribers and retaining existing ones. Furthermore, it addresses the challenge of 'data drain' often associated with heavy video streaming. Telecom companies, rather than viewing this as a problem, are transforming it into an opportunity.", "normalised": "One significant driver for these alliances is the surging demand for digital entertainment across India.
