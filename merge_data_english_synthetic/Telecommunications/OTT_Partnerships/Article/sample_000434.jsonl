{"unnormalised": "Partnerships with OTT providers allow telecom operators to leverage their existing infrastructure to deliver enhanced user experiences. One common model involves bundling data packages with subscriptions to popular OTT platforms. For example, a partnership could offer a 100 GB data plan bundled with a three-month subscription to SonyLIV, providing customers in Mumbai with a cost-effective solution for their entertainment needs. Another approach involves integrating OTT services directly into the telecom operator's mobile app, creating a centralized hub for content discovery and consumption. Reliance Jio, for instance, has successfully implemented this strategy through its JioCinema platform.", "normalised": "Partnerships with O T T providers allow telecom operators to leverage their existing infrastructure to deliver enhanced user experiences.

{"unnormalised": "These partnerships offer several benefits. For telecom operators, they drive subscriber acquisition, reduce churn, and increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). For OTT providers, they expand their reach to a wider audience and benefit from the operator's established billing and customer support infrastructure. Moreover, collaborative efforts can result in optimized content delivery networks (CDNs), reducing latency and improving streaming quality for end-users, especially crucial during peak viewing times such as during the Onam festival when families across Kerala stream movies and shows together.", "normalised": "These partnerships offer several benefits.
