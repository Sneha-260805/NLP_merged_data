This approach allows Jio to attract and retain subscribers by offering a comprehensive entertainment package alongside connectivity. Similarly, Airtel's Xstream platform aggregates content from various OTT providers, offering users a single point of access to a diverse range of movies, shows, and live channels. These partnerships are not merely about content delivery; they represent a fundamental shift in the telecom value chain.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio's bundling of O T T platforms like Disney+ Hotstar and Netflix with its mobile and broadband plans serves as a prime example.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, we can expect to see even more innovative OTT partnerships in the Indian telecom sector. These may include collaborations in areas such as gaming, e-commerce, and healthcare, further blurring the lines between connectivity and content. The potential for growth is immense, with projections suggesting that the Indian OTT market will reach Rs. 25,000 crores by 2025. Imagine, for example, Airtel partnering with a local artisanal food delivery OTT based out of Lucknow, reaching customers within a 5 km radius offering services from shops as small as 500 sq ft. The future of Indian telecommunications is inextricably linked to the success of these OTT partnerships, paving the way for a richer and more engaging digital experience for consumers across the nation.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, we can expect to see even more innovative O T T partnerships in the Indian telecom sector.
