{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation, driven by the exponential growth of Over-The-Top (OTT) media services. This paradigm shift presents both challenges and significant opportunities for telecom operators. Strategic partnerships with OTT platforms are increasingly becoming a critical imperative for telcos to retain and grow their subscriber base, enhance Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), and navigate the evolving digital ecosystem.", "normalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation, driven by the exponential growth of Over-The-Top media services.

{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, telcos viewed OTT platforms with some degree of apprehension, perceiving them as direct competitors eroding voice and SMS revenue. However, a more nuanced understanding has emerged, recognizing the potential for symbiotic relationships. By bundling data packages with OTT subscriptions, telcos like Airtel and Jio can offer compelling value propositions to consumers. For instance, a bundled subscription to Hotstar, a popular OTT platform, can be included with a 100 GB monthly data plan for Rs. 799, attracting cricket enthusiasts keen on watching the IPL live. This strategy not only enhances customer loyalty but also encourages higher data consumption, a key revenue driver for telcos.", "normalised": "Traditionally, telcos viewed Over-The-Top platforms with some degree of apprehension, perceiving them as direct competitors eroding voice and S M S revenue.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, OTT partnerships extend beyond mere bundling. Telcos are exploring collaborative content creation, particularly in regional languages, to cater to the diverse linguistic demographics of India. Imagine a partnership between Vi and Zee5, co-producing a web series set against the backdrop of Varanasi, showcasing the city's rich cultural heritage. This would resonate strongly with viewers in Uttar Pradesh and beyond.", "normalised": "Furthermore, Over-The-Top partnerships extend beyond mere bundling.
