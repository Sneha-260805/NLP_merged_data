{"unnormalised": "For telecom companies like Airtel and Jio, OTT partnerships represent a vital avenue for differentiation in a fiercely competitive market. Offering bundled subscriptions to popular OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar alongside data plans is becoming a standard practice. This allows them to attract and retain customers by providing added value beyond basic connectivity. Imagine a subscriber in Mumbai enjoying unlimited 5G data bundled with a Hotstar VIP subscription to watch the latest cricket match – a compelling proposition.", "normalised": "For telecom companies like Airtel and Jio, O T T partnerships represent a vital avenue for differentiation in a fiercely competitive market.

Regulators like TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) are actively monitoring these partnerships to maintain a level playing field. Furthermore, effectively managing data traffic and network congestion due to increased OTT consumption is a key operational concern. Scaling infrastructure to handle the demands of video streaming, especially in densely populated urban areas, requires significant investment. A single family consuming 100GB of data per month for streaming in a 1,000 sq ft apartment highlights the bandwidth demands.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
