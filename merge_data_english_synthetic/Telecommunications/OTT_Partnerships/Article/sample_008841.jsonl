{"unnormalised": "These collaborations often manifest in several forms. Bundling offerings, where telcos provide access to OTT platforms as part of their data plans, are increasingly common. For instance, a subscriber might receive a bundled subscription to a popular streaming service like Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video with their monthly broadband or mobile data package. This strategy allows telcos to attract and retain subscribers by offering a comprehensive entertainment solution. Reliance Jio, for example, has been aggressive in bundling various OTT services with its JioFiber and Jio mobile plans, a move that has significantly contributed to its market dominance.", "normalised": "These collaborations often manifest in several forms.

Telcos can partner with OTT platforms to co-promote their services, sharing the resulting revenue based on agreed-upon terms. This model encourages collaboration and allows both entities to benefit from the reach and expertise of the other.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of these partnerships are multifaceted. For telcos, it presents an opportunity to reduce churn rate, attract new subscribers, and increase average revenue per user (ARPU). By bundling appealing OTT content, telcos can differentiate themselves from competitors and solidify their position in the market. For OTT platforms, the partnerships provide access to a vast user base, enhanced distribution channels, and reduced customer acquisition costs.

Telcos need to ensure that their partnerships comply with all relevant regulations and that their network infrastructure is robust enough to handle the increased data traffic generated by streaming services. The cost of these partnerships, including subscriber acquisition costs and content licensing fees, also needs to be carefully managed to ensure profitability.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, OTT partnerships will continue to be a vital strategic imperative for Indian telcos. As data consumption continues to rise, fueled by occasions like Diwali celebrations and the increasing adoption of digital entertainment, telcos need to proactively leverage these partnerships to offer compelling value propositions to their customers. Imagine enjoying a plate of piping hot biryani while streaming your favourite Onam festival movie, all facilitated by a seamless and integrated telco-OTT experience. The future of telecommunications in India is inextricably linked to the evolution of these dynamic and collaborative relationships. Investments of around Rs. 500 crore are expected in further expanding this sector by 2025, with 1000 km of new fiber optic cable installations anticipated to support the growing data demands.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, O T T partnerships will continue to be a vital strategic imperative for Indian telcos.
