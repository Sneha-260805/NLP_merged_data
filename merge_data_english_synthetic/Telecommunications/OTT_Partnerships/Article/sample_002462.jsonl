{"unnormalised": "Telecom operators, like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, possess extensive network infrastructure, nationwide reach, and established customer bases. These assets are invaluable to OTT platforms aiming to penetrate the vast Indian market, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities like Lucknow and Jaipur. Bundling OTT subscriptions with existing telecom plans, offering data packages tailored for streaming, and providing seamless access to OTT content through dedicated platforms are key strategies employed in these partnerships.", "normalised": "Telecom operators, like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, possess extensive network infrastructure, nationwide reach, and established customer bases.

They can also benefit from the operator’s billing infrastructure, simplifying payment processes and improving customer acquisition. This is particularly crucial in a market like India where digital literacy and access to traditional banking services are not universal. Think of a rural consumer, perhaps inspired by a Bollywood film like 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', now able to easily access a wide range of movies and shows through a bundled telecom and OTT offering.", "normalised": "Over The Top platforms, on the other hand, gain access to a wider audience, leveraging the telecom operator's existing marketing channels and distribution networks.
