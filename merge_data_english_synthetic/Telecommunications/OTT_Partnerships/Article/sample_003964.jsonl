{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a radical transformation, fuelled by the burgeoning popularity of Over-The-Top (OTT) content. As data consumption skyrockets, driven by platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and local players such as Hotstar and Zee5, telecom operators are increasingly recognizing the strategic imperative of forging partnerships with these OTT providers. These collaborations are proving vital for enhancing customer acquisition, improving subscriber retention, and unlocking new revenue streams in an increasingly competitive market.", "normalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a radical transformation, fueled by the burgeoning popularity of Over-The-Top O T T content.

{"unnormalised": "Telecom companies, historically focused on voice and data services, are now leveraging OTT partnerships to offer bundled packages that combine connectivity with premium entertainment. This approach allows operators like Airtel and Jio to differentiate themselves from competitors by providing value-added services beyond basic internet access. For example, offering a data plan bundled with a subscription to a popular OTT platform like SonyLIV during festive seasons like Diwali or Onam can significantly boost subscription numbers.", "normalised": "Telecom companies, historically focused on voice and data services, are now leveraging O T T partnerships to offer bundled packages that combine connectivity with premium entertainment.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of these partnerships are reciprocal. OTT platforms gain access to a wider audience through the telecom operator's extensive subscriber base and established distribution channels. This is particularly crucial in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where internet penetration is still growing, but mobile connectivity is widespread. Imagine a JioFiber plan bundled with complimentary access to a regional OTT platform specializing in South Indian cinema – a powerful incentive for potential subscribers in Chennai or Bangalore.", "normalised": "The benefits of these partnerships are reciprocal.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, collaborations extend beyond bundled subscriptions. Operators are exploring innovative business models, including direct carrier billing (DCB), allowing users to pay for OTT subscriptions through their mobile bills. This simplifies the payment process, particularly for users who may not have access to credit cards or other digital payment methods. Imagine paying for your monthly Netflix subscription directly through your Airtel prepaid balance – a convenient and accessible option for millions of Indians.", "normalised": "Furthermore, collaborations extend beyond bundled subscriptions.
