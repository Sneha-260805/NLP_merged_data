{"unnormalised": "For telecom operators like Jio and Airtel, these partnerships offer a powerful way to enhance customer value, reduce churn, and drive data consumption. By bundling OTT subscriptions – like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or homegrown platforms such as Eros Now and Zee5 – with their data plans, telecom companies create a compelling value proposition. For instance, a JioFiber plan might include a free Amazon Prime subscription, making it more attractive than competing offers. Bharti Airtel, too, offers bundled plans including Disney+ Hotstar. This not only increases subscriber loyalty but also encourages customers to upgrade to higher data tiers.", "normalised": "For telecom operators like Jio and Airtel, these partnerships offer a powerful way to enhance customer value, reduce churn, and drive data consumption.

{"unnormalised": "OTT platforms, in turn, benefit from the vast reach and established distribution networks of telecom operators. Gaining access to millions of subscribers across India, many of whom may not have traditionally considered paying for OTT services, is a significant advantage. This access facilitates faster user acquisition and reduces customer acquisition costs, a crucial factor in a competitive market. Imagine a potential partnership between Vodafone Idea (Vi) and a regional OTT platform specializing in Marathi content; this could unlock a significant subscriber base in Maharashtra.", "normalised": "O T T platforms, in turn, benefit from the vast reach and established distribution networks of telecom operators.

{"unnormalised": "The future of OTT partnerships in India looks promising, with projections indicating significant growth in both the telecom and OTT sectors. Deals are structured in various ways, from revenue sharing models to bundled subscriptions. Consider a hypothetical situation where BSNL, facing stiff competition, partners with a smaller OTT platform offering content focused on educational programs for rural students, bridging the digital divide. The cost of such a partnership could range from Rs. 50 Lakhs to Rs. 5 Crores depending on the scale and scope. These collaborations are not just about entertainment; they are also about delivering essential services like e-learning and healthcare through innovative digital channels, transforming homes from simple living spaces to information hubs measuring roughly 500 sq ft. Dr. Sharma at IIM Ahmedabad believes this trend will continue to accelerate, leading to greater consolidation and innovation within the Indian digital entertainment ecosystem.", "normalised": "The future of O T T partnerships in India looks promising, with projections indicating significant growth in both the telecom and O T T sectors.
