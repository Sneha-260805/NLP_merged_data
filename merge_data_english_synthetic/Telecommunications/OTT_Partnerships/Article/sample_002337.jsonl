{"unnormalised": "OTT partnerships enable telecom operators to leverage the content prowess of these platforms to enhance their offerings. For instance, a telecom operator might bundle a free subscription to an OTT platform with its data plans, attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Imagine an Airtel user in Mumbai receiving a free Disney+ Hotstar subscription with their Rs. 499 monthly plan, enabling them to watch IPL matches and the latest Bollywood releases. This kind of value-added service significantly boosts customer loyalty and reduces churn.", "normalised": "O T T partnerships enable telecom operators to leverage the content prowess of these platforms to enhance their offerings.

We can expect to see more innovative bundled offerings, personalized content recommendations, and integrated billing solutions. Imagine a future where Dr. Sharma in Chennai can seamlessly pay for his Netflix subscription directly through his Jio bill, earning reward points in the process. The possibilities are endless, and the telecommunications companies that embrace these partnerships will be best positioned to thrive in the evolving digital landscape. Content creation from smaller regional OTT players catering to areas like Ahmedabad will also be a key factor. This will also help bridge the digital divide in rural areas of 100 sq ft houses, where access to traditional entertainment is limited.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of O T T partnerships in India is bright.
