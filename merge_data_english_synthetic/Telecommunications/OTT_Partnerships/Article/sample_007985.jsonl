{"unnormalised": "These partnerships take various forms, ranging from bundled subscription offers to integrated billing solutions and even content co-creation. For instance, a telecom giant like Airtel might offer a bundled subscription of Disney+ Hotstar VIP along with its broadband plans, attracting new subscribers and retaining existing ones. Similarly, Jio could partner with Netflix to provide its premium subscribers with access to exclusive content. These tie-ups not only increase the perceived value of telecom services but also reduce churn, a significant concern in the fiercely competitive Indian market.", "normalised": "These partnerships take various forms, ranging from bundled subscription offers to integrated billing solutions and even content co-creation.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond bundled subscriptions, telcos are also exploring innovative ways to integrate OTT content into their services. Imagine a scenario where a Vodafone Idea user can stream their favourite movie on Vi Movies & TV app without consuming their data allowance – a powerful incentive to stay within the Vodafone Idea ecosystem. Data consumption in India is a key driver, with users in cities like Mumbai and Delhi consuming an average of 15 GB of data per month primarily for video streaming. Such partnerships can significantly impact data revenue and subscriber stickiness.", "normalised": "Beyond bundled subscriptions, telcos are also exploring innovative ways to integrate O T T content into their services.
