{"unnormalised": "These partnerships represent a mutually beneficial ecosystem. For telecommunication providers like Bharti Airtel or Reliance Jio, collaborations with OTT platforms like Hotstar, Zee5, or even international players like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, offer a compelling value proposition for their subscriber base. Bundled offerings, where subscribers gain access to OTT content alongside their data plans, are becoming increasingly prevalent. These bundles act as a powerful customer acquisition and retention tool, reducing churn and boosting Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by offering a comprehensive entertainment solution. For instance, a JioFiber plan might include subscriptions to multiple OTT platforms, creating significant stickiness.", "normalised": "These partnerships represent a mutually beneficial ecosystem.

The potential for growth is immense, and the rewards will accrue to those who can effectively navigate this complex and rapidly evolving ecosystem. Rs. 100 crore is not an uncommon investment in these partnerships, reflecting their strategic importance.
