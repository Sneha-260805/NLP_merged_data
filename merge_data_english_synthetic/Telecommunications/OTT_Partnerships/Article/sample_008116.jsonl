{"unnormalised": "These partnerships manifest in diverse forms, ranging from bundled data packages offering access to specific OTT services to integrated billing solutions and content delivery network (CDN) optimization. For instance, a telecom operator in Maharashtra might offer a Rs. 499/month plan that includes unlimited data and a subscription to a popular Bollywood streaming service like Hotstar, or even a regional platform showcasing Marathi cinema. This not only attracts new customers but also incentivizes existing users to upgrade to higher-value plans.", "normalised": "These partnerships manifest in diverse forms, ranging from bundled data packages offering access to specific Over The Top services to integrated billing solutions and content delivery network optimization.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond bundled packages, partnerships extend to areas like content localization and regionalization. Imagine a collaboration between a telecom operator and an OTT platform focused on showcasing regional Indian cinema, catering to the diverse linguistic preferences across the country. This resonates strongly with the local population and provides a distinct competitive advantage. Telecom operators can also leverage their infrastructure and expertise to improve the quality of experience for OTT users, particularly in areas with limited network capacity. This could involve deploying edge computing solutions to cache content closer to the user, reducing latency and buffering.", "normalised": "Beyond bundled packages, partnerships extend to areas like content localization and regionalization.
