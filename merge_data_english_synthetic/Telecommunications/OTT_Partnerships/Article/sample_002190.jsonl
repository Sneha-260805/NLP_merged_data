{"unnormalised": "For telecom operators like Airtel and Jio, these partnerships provide a vital means of retaining and acquiring customers in an intensely competitive market. Bundling OTT subscriptions (such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or homegrown players like Zee5 and Voot) with data plans enhances the value proposition and reduces churn. For instance, a bundled plan offering unlimited data and access to SonyLIV for Rs. 799/month is far more attractive than a standalone data pack. These strategic alliances help telcos differentiate themselves from competitors.", "normalised": "For telecom operators like Airtel and Jio, these partnerships provide a vital means of retaining and acquiring customers in an intensely competitive market.

{"unnormalised": "OTT platforms, on the other hand, gain access to a massive and readily available user base. Partnering with a telecom giant unlocks unparalleled distribution capabilities, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where direct marketing might be less effective. Consider a partnership where Jio offers a free 3-month subscription to Hotstar to its prepaid customers; this instantly expands Hotstar's reach across India. Further, these collaborations can involve optimizing streaming quality across the telecom operator's network, ensuring a smooth viewing experience and reducing buffering issues, particularly vital for content like live cricket matches, a national obsession.", "normalised": "Over The Top platforms, on the other hand, gain access to a massive and readily available user base.

Telcos might explore incorporating OTT content into their own branded apps, creating integrated entertainment hubs. Regional content, reflecting India's diverse linguistic landscape, will likely become a greater focus. For example, collaborations to offer more Marathi or Bengali language content could significantly boost engagement in those regions. The Indian telecom sector, with support from institutions like TRAI, is poised to leverage OTT partnerships to drive growth and deliver enriched entertainment experiences to millions, from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene hills of Shillong, all within the palm of their hand. The area of a cell tower, which ensures seamless connectivity for OTT services, can cover an area of approximately 2 sq km in urban areas.
