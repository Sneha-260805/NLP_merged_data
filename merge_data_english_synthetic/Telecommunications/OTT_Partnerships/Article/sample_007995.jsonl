One common approach is bundled offerings, where telecom subscribers receive free or discounted access to OTT platforms alongside their data or voice plans. For instance, a leading telecom provider in Mumbai might offer a bundled plan with a Netflix or Amazon Prime Video subscription, incentivizing users to choose their services. This benefits both parties; the telecom company gains subscriber loyalty, while the OTT platform expands its user base, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 cities like Lucknow and Patna.", "normalised": "These partnerships manifest in several forms.

As 5G technology rolls out, enabling faster and more reliable internet speeds, the demand for high-quality video content will continue to surge. Telecom operators will need to innovate and explore new partnership models to stay ahead in this dynamic market. One potential area is partnering with OTT platforms specializing in educational content (EdTech) or healthcare services (HealthTech), addressing broader societal needs. Investments in content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge computing infrastructure, potentially costing Rs. 500 crore per telco for nationwide coverage, will be crucial for delivering a superior user experience. This could lead to partnerships focusing on creating hyperlocal content relevant to specific regions or communities, further personalizing the user experience.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, O T T partnerships are expected to become even more prevalent in the Indian telecom sector.
