{"unnormalised": "Over-The-Top (OTT) partnerships have emerged as a critical strategic avenue for telecommunications providers in India. Facing increasing competition and evolving consumer preferences, telcos are leveraging collaborations with OTT platforms to enhance their service offerings, attract new subscribers, and retain existing ones in a fiercely competitive market.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is characterized by intense price wars and declining average revenue per user (ARPU). To combat this, companies like Reliance Jio and Airtel are increasingly turning to OTT partnerships to differentiate their offerings. For example, a JioFiber plan might include a subscription to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, bundled with high-speed internet access at a competitive price. Similarly, Airtel Xstream offers a curated selection of content from various OTT platforms through a single interface.", "normalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is characterized by intense price wars and declining average revenue per user (A R P U).

{"unnormalised": "These partnerships are mutually beneficial. OTT platforms gain access to a vast subscriber base, leveraging the telcos’ existing infrastructure and distribution network. This allows them to expand their reach, especially in Tier-II and Tier-III cities like Lucknow and Patna, where digital penetration is still growing. For telcos, OTT bundles provide a valuable value-added service that can significantly increase customer stickiness. Imagine a consumer choosing Airtel over a competitor simply because of the bundled Disney+ Hotstar subscription, allowing them to watch the latest IPL match or a Bollywood blockbuster like \"Pathaan.\"", "normalised": "These partnerships are mutually beneficial.

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, telcos that embrace strategic collaborations with OTT platforms will be best positioned to thrive in the long run, capturing a larger share of the growing digital entertainment market and bolstering their ARPU figures in the process. A bundled plan costing Rs. 799 providing 100 Mbps and access to 5 OTT platforms appears much more compelling than a standalone internet package for the same price.
