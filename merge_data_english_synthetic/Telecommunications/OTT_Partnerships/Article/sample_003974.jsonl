{"unnormalised": "These partnerships take various forms, ranging from bundling OTT subscriptions with data plans to offering direct carrier billing options. For instance, Airtel might offer a bundled plan with a Hotstar subscription for Rs. 499/month, or Jio could provide seamless integration with a selection of OTT apps through its JioFiber service. Such collaborations enhance customer value proposition, increasing subscriber stickiness and attracting new customers. Offering free or discounted access to platforms showcasing popular Indian content, including regional language shows and Bollywood movies, is particularly appealing.", "normalised": "These partnerships take various forms, ranging from bundling O T T subscriptions with data plans to offering direct carrier billing options.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits extend beyond pure revenue generation. Data consumption sees a considerable uptick, driven by video streaming, thus bolstering demand for high-speed internet infrastructure. This increased demand then justifies further investment in network upgrades and expansion, particularly in rural areas underserved by reliable broadband.

A well-executed OTT partnership strategy can solidify a telecom operator's position as a comprehensive digital service provider, offering a compelling and integrated entertainment experience to the Indian consumer. Offering a complimentary \"Biryani Nights\" package with access to cooking shows on a streaming platform alongside high-speed data during the evening could be a creative example. Ultimately, these collaborations are not just about surviving in a competitive market; they are about thriving and shaping the future of digital entertainment consumption in India.
