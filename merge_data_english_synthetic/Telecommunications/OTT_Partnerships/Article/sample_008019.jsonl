{"unnormalised": "One of the primary drivers behind these partnerships is the intense competition within the telecom sector. Operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea are constantly seeking ways to differentiate their offerings. Bundling OTT subscriptions with data plans provides a compelling value proposition, attracting new customers and reducing churn. Imagine a user in Chennai opting for a JioFiber plan specifically because it includes a subscription to Hotstar, allowing them to stream IPL matches seamlessly. This simple scenario exemplifies the power of OTT bundling.", "normalised": "One of the primary drivers behind these partnerships is the intense competition within the telecom sector.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of OTT partnerships in the Indian telecom sector appears bright. As 5G technology becomes more widespread, the potential for delivering high-quality, immersive OTT experiences will only increase. We can expect to see further innovation in this space, with telecom operators exploring partnerships with niche OTT platforms catering to specific demographics or interests. For instance, a partnership between BSNL and a regional language content provider focusing on Tamil or Telugu cinema could be highly successful in targeting specific geographic regions.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of O T T partnerships in the Indian telecom sector appears bright.

{"unnormalised": "The impact extends beyond individual users. Consider the potential for these partnerships to boost local content creation. With greater accessibility to platforms, aspiring filmmakers and artists in smaller cities like Lucknow or Jaipur can find a wider audience. Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi estimates that OTT platforms, fueled by these partnerships, will contribute significantly to the Rs. 2,000 crore Indian entertainment industry by 2025. Furthermore, such collaborations can drive infrastructure development, including the expansion of fiber optic networks covering even remote villages spanning hundreds of km and needing exchanges built in as little as 500 sq ft.", "normalised": "The impact extends beyond individual users.
