{"unnormalised": "For telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Airtel, partnering with OTT giants such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar offers a significant competitive advantage. These partnerships allow telcos to bundle attractive entertainment packages with their core connectivity services (voice and data). For instance, a postpaid plan might include a complimentary one-year subscription to an OTT platform, incentivizing customer acquisition and retention. The allure of access to a vast library of movies, TV shows, and original content at no extra cost significantly enhances the perceived value proposition of the telecom plan.", "normalised": "For telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Airtel, partnering with O T T giants such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar offers a significant competitive advantage.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, these partnerships extend beyond mere subscription bundling. Integrated service offerings, such as data-free access to specific OTT platforms or customized content recommendations, are becoming increasingly prevalent. Airtel Xstream Premium, for example, aggregates content from multiple OTT platforms under a single subscription and provides a unified user interface. This simplifies content discovery and consumption for the end-user, making the overall experience more seamless and convenient.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these partnerships extend beyond mere subscription bundling.

OTT platforms gain access to the vast subscriber base of telecom operators, significantly expanding their reach, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where awareness and adoption of OTT services might be lower. Telecom operators can leverage their extensive retail networks and customer support infrastructure to promote OTT services, driving user acquisition and engagement.", "normalised": "The benefits are reciprocal.

Telcos must carefully manage the complex commercial arrangements, including revenue sharing models and data consumption policies, to ensure profitability. Moreover, they need to prioritize network optimization to deliver a high-quality streaming experience, especially during peak hours when network congestion can impact video playback quality. Imagine a family trying to stream a new movie on Onam, only to be plagued by constant buffering due to inadequate network capacity.", "normalised": "However, these partnerships also present challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The future of OTT partnerships in India’s telecommunications sector is bright, with further integration and innovation on the horizon. We can expect to see more sophisticated data analytics being used to personalize content recommendations and optimize network performance. Telecom operators might also explore partnerships with regional OTT platforms, catering to the diverse linguistic and cultural preferences of the Indian population. The strategic alignment of telecom and OTT players is crucial for navigating the evolving digital entertainment landscape and delivering enhanced value to consumers across the country. Just as biryani requires the perfect blend of rice, meat, and spices, successful OTT partnerships require a harmonious collaboration between connectivity and content.", "normalised": "The future of O T T partnerships in India’s telecommunications sector is bright, with further integration and innovation on the horizon.
