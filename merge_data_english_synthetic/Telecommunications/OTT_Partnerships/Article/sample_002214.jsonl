{"unnormalised": "These partnerships are not just about providing entertainment. They are also about data consumption. Increased content consumption on OTT platforms directly translates to higher data usage, benefiting telecom operators' revenue streams. For instance, a family in Mumbai watching content in HD on Netflix could easily consume several GBs of data per day. This is particularly relevant in a country like India, where data affordability remains a key concern for many users. Telecom companies can then upsell higher data plans to accommodate this usage.", "normalised": "These partnerships are not just about providing entertainment. They are also about data consumption.

By bundling OTT subscriptions with their existing services, they can cater to a wider audience, including those who may be solely interested in entertainment or specific content genres. Imagine a college student in Delhi subscribing to a data plan specifically to binge-watch a popular web series on Hotstar.", "normalised": "Moreover, O T T partnerships enable telecom operators to expand their reach and attract new customer segments.

As the demand for digital content continues to surge, and as 5G technology further enhances streaming capabilities, we can expect to see even more innovative collaborations between telecom operators and OTT platforms. This symbiotic relationship will continue to shape the telecommunications industry, offering consumers access to a diverse range of content and services at competitive prices. From bustling metros like Bangalore to smaller towns across the country, the convergence of telecom and OTT is redefining entertainment and connectivity for millions. Dr. Sharma, a leading telecom analyst at IIT Madras, predicts a Rs. 50,000 Cr market for bundled OTT services by 2025, facilitated by these strategic alliances. This includes potential smart home packages with security surveillance consuming significant data and needing robust telecom infrastructure covering vast areas, potentially 1000 sq ft. properties to sprawling gated communities.", "normalised": "The future of O T T partnerships in India looks promising.
