{"unnormalised": "The benefits for telecom operators are clear: increased ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), reduced churn, and enhanced brand perception. For OTT platforms, partnerships provide access to a vast subscriber base, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities where telecom operators have a strong foothold. The potential reach into areas like Kanpur, Lucknow, and even smaller towns presents tremendous growth opportunities. Consider that a single Jio tower can cover several sq km and potentially reach thousands of households previously unconnected to premium OTT services.", "normalised": "The benefits for telecom operators are clear: increased A R P U (Average Revenue Per User), reduced churn, and enhanced brand perception.
