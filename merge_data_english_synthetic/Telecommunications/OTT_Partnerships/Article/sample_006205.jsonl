For example, a telecom operator might offer a bundled plan that includes a subscription to a popular OTT platform along with a certain amount of data per month. Part of the subscription revenue is then shared between the telecom operator and the OTT provider. This allows the telecom operator to generate additional revenue streams beyond traditional voice and data services.", "normalised": "Revenue sharing models are a common feature of these partnerships.
