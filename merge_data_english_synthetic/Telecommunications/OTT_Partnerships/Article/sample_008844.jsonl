{"unnormalised": "One primary driver for these collaborations is enhanced data monetization. Telecom operators, such as Airtel and Jio, invest heavily in network infrastructure, including laying thousands of kilometers of optical fiber across states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, to deliver high-speed internet. Partnering with OTT platforms like Hotstar, SonyLIV, and Amazon Prime Video allows these operators to monetize their data infrastructure more effectively by bundling data plans with OTT subscriptions. This encourages higher data consumption and reduces customer churn, particularly in a price-sensitive market like India.", "normalised": "One primary driver for these collaborations is enhanced data monetization.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, OTT partnerships enable telecom operators to provide bundled entertainment packages, a powerful value proposition for Indian consumers. For instance, imagine a JioFiber plan offering access to both high-speed internet and a subscription to Netflix, coupled with access to regional content providers offering movies and web series in languages like Malayalam and Telugu. Such bundles resonate strongly during festive seasons like Diwali and Onam, when entertainment consumption peaks.", "normalised": "Furthermore, O T T partnerships enable telecom operators to provide bundled entertainment packages, a powerful value proposition for Indian consumers.

{"unnormalised": "From the OTT provider's perspective, partnerships with telecom operators offer access to a vast and readily available customer base, reduced customer acquisition costs, and seamless billing integrations. For instance, instead of individual subscribers managing their own subscriptions, telecom operators can offer integrated billing, adding the OTT subscription cost to the monthly mobile or broadband bill. This simplifies the user experience and encourages adoption, particularly in rural areas where digital literacy may be lower.", "normalised": "From the O T T provider's perspective, partnerships with telecom operators offer access to a vast and readily available customer base, reduced customer acquisition costs, and seamless billing integrations.

Telecom operators must ensure that these partnerships don't violate net neutrality principles and that revenue sharing is equitable and transparent. Competition is also fierce, with multiple players vying for strategic alliances.", "normalised": "However, challenges exist.

{"unnormalised": "Successful partnerships require a deep understanding of the Indian consumer's preferences and viewing habits. Regional content is paramount, and bundles should cater to diverse tastes, offering everything from Bollywood blockbusters to international documentaries and regional delicacies (similar to a delicious Hyderabadi biryani) catered through live commerce.", "normalised": "Successful partnerships require a deep understanding of the Indian consumer's preferences and viewing habits.
