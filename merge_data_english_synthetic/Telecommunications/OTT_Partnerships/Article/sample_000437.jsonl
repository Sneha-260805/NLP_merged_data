{"unnormalised": "Reliance Jio's early bundling of content with its data plans set a precedent, effectively disrupting the market and forcing other players like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to follow suit. These partnerships often involve offering bundled subscriptions to popular OTT services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar alongside data and voice packages. The lure of bundled content significantly enhances the perceived value of the telco's offering, particularly amongst younger demographics keen on consuming digital entertainment.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio's early bundling of content with its data plans set a precedent, effectively disrupting the market and forcing other players like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to follow suit.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond subscription bundles, OTT partnerships are also exploring innovative models. This includes zero-rating data for specific OTT applications, enabling customers to access content without incurring data charges. Such initiatives, while subject to net neutrality debates, can drive significant user engagement and app adoption, especially in semi-urban and rural areas where data affordability remains a concern. Imagine a telecom operator offering zero-rated access to educational content from Byju's for students in Madurai. This kind of targeted partnership fosters goodwill and demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility.", "normalised": "Beyond subscription bundles, O T T partnerships are also exploring innovative models.

By deploying Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) closer to the user, telecom operators can minimize latency and buffering, ensuring a seamless viewing experience. This is particularly critical for high-bandwidth content like live sports events and 4K movies, essential for a pleasurable user experience during peak consumption times like the IPL season or festivals like Onam, where families gather to watch movies and shows together.", "normalised": "Furthermore, telcos are leveraging their extensive network infrastructure to improve the Quality of Service (Q o S) for O T T video streaming.
