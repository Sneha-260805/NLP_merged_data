{"unnormalised": "For telecom companies like Airtel and Jio, bundling OTT subscriptions with data plans has become a crucial strategy to differentiate themselves and combat churn. For example, offering a year's subscription to popular platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Disney+ Hotstar alongside a premium data plan can significantly enhance the perceived value and attractiveness of the telecom operator's services. This model is especially appealing to younger demographics and those in urban areas such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, who are avid consumers of digital content.", "normalised": "For telecom companies like Airtel and Jio, bundling O T T subscriptions with data plans has become a crucial strategy to differentiate themselves and combat churn.

Some telecom providers are exploring innovative models like zero-rating content, where users can access specific OTT platforms without consuming their data allowance. This provides a significant advantage to consumers, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, where data affordability remains a key concern. This initiative aims to boost content consumption and drive data usage on the telecom operator’s network.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these partnerships extend beyond simple bundling.
