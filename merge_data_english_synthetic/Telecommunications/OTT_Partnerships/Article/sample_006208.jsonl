{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, largely driven by the explosive growth of Over-The-Top (OTT) media services. Consumers in cities like Mumbai and Delhi increasingly prefer streaming content on platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotstar, leading to significant shifts in data consumption patterns and revenue streams for telecom operators. Recognizing this evolving dynamic, forging strategic partnerships with OTT providers has become a critical imperative for Indian telcos to enhance subscriber acquisition, reduce churn, and unlock new revenue opportunities.", "normalised": "The Indian telecommunications landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, largely driven by the explosive growth of Over-The-Top (O T T) media services.

{"unnormalised": "These partnerships can manifest in several forms. Bundled offerings, where telecom providers package data plans with subscriptions to popular OTT platforms, are gaining traction. For instance, a major telco like Jio could offer a bundled plan that includes high-speed data along with access to SonyLIV, appealing to a wider audience. This not only enhances the value proposition for consumers but also reduces the likelihood of them switching to a competitor.", "normalised": "These partnerships can manifest in several forms.

Imagine Airtel launching a streaming service curated with local Indian content, including regional cinema and documentaries, catering to the diverse linguistic preferences of the nation. This enables them to retain a stronger grip on content distribution and enhance brand loyalty.", "normalised": "Furthermore, telcos can leverage their extensive infrastructure and customer base to offer co-branded content or white-labeled O T T platforms.

{"unnormalised": "Technical collaborations are also crucial. Optimizing network infrastructure to ensure seamless streaming experiences is paramount. Telcos can work closely with OTT providers to implement content delivery networks (CDNs) closer to the user, reducing latency and buffering, especially during peak viewing times. Think about ensuring buffer-free streaming of the IPL final across the country.", "normalised": "Technical collaborations are also crucial.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Net neutrality concerns need careful consideration to ensure fair access and avoid anti-competitive practices. Moreover, revenue sharing models between telcos and OTT providers need to be equitable and sustainable to ensure long-term viability. Successfully navigating these challenges requires proactive regulatory engagement and a commitment to fostering a collaborative ecosystem.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

With enhanced bandwidth and lower latency, telcos can deliver even richer and more immersive streaming experiences.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, strategic OTT partnerships represent a win-win scenario. Telcos can leverage the popularity of OTT platforms to drive data consumption and subscriber growth, while OTT providers can tap into the vast reach and distribution networks of telcos to expand their user base. By embracing collaboration and innovation, Indian telecommunications providers can effectively navigate the evolving media landscape and secure a prosperous future. Data costs, currently averaging Rs. 7 per GB, are anticipated to fall with better OTT-telco synergies. A recent study suggests that collaborations can increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by 15% within 6 months of launch, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, expanding access to entertainment beyond the metros, possibly even 50 km from any major city.", "normalised": "Ultimately, strategic O T T partnerships represent a win-win scenario.
