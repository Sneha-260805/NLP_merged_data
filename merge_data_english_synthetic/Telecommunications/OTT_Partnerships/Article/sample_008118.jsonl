{"unnormalised": "Telecom operators, like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, are leveraging OTT partnerships to differentiate their offerings in a fiercely competitive market. By bundling popular streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar with their data plans, they enhance the appeal of their services and attract new subscribers. This strategy also helps in reducing churn rate, as customers are more likely to remain with a provider that offers a comprehensive entertainment package. Imagine, for example, a customer in Lucknow getting a 100 GB data plan with access to the latest Bollywood blockbuster, perhaps inspired by a scene from \"3 Idiots,\" streaming seamlessly on an OTT platform included in the bundle. The convenience and value are undeniable.", "normalised": "Telecom operators, like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, are leveraging Over The Top partnerships to differentiate their offerings in a fiercely competitive market.

{"unnormalised": "For OTT platforms, partnerships with telecom operators provide access to a massive user base and significantly expand their reach, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. These collaborations often involve pre-installation of OTT apps on telecom operator-branded devices, special data packages optimized for streaming, and even integrated billing solutions. This lowers the barrier to entry for consumers who might otherwise be hesitant to subscribe to individual OTT services. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, for instance, now offers online certificate courses which are promoted through telecom partner OTT platforms to a wider audience, demonstrating the potential for educational content distribution.", "normalised": "For Over The Top platforms, partnerships with telecom operators provide access to a massive user base and significantly expand their reach, particularly in Tier two and Tier three cities.
