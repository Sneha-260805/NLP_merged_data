{"unnormalised": "These partnerships manifest in various forms. Bundled offerings, where subscribers receive access to specific OTT platforms like Hotstar or Zee5 along with their data plans, are a common strategy. This \"data + content\" approach, particularly popular with younger demographics, allows telcos to differentiate themselves from competitors. Imagine a JioFiber plan offering free access to Prime Video, echoing the kind of entertainment found in films like \"Gully Boy,\" resonating deeply with urban youth.", "normalised": "These partnerships manifest in various forms.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond bundling, revenue sharing models are also gaining traction. In these arrangements, telecom operators receive a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by the OTT platform from users accessing it through their network. This model allows telcos to directly monetize the increased data consumption driven by OTT services. Airtel, for instance, could collaborate with a regional OTT player like Hoichoi, specializing in Bengali content, to target specific linguistic user bases in West Bengal and neighboring states.", "normalised": "Beyond bundling, revenue sharing models are also gaining traction.
