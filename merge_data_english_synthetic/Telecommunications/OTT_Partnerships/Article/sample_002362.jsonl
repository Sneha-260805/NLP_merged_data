{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, telecom companies in India, like Airtel and Jio, have focused on providing connectivity – the pipes through which data flows. However, the rise of OTT services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotstar has shifted consumer focus toward content. Consumers now prioritize data plans that offer seamless streaming and access to their favorite shows and films, often produced by platforms like Eros Now or Balaji Telefilms. This shift necessitates a rethinking of traditional revenue models.", "normalised": "Traditionally, telecom companies in India, like Airtel and Jio, have focused on providing connectivity – the pipes through which data flows.

{"unnormalised": "Partnerships offer a multi-faceted approach to value creation. Telecom operators can bundle OTT subscriptions with their data plans, offering a more compelling value proposition to consumers. Imagine a Jio Fiber plan bundled with a Hotstar subscription, providing access to both high-speed internet and the latest cricket matches – a proposition highly attractive to the Indian consumer. This increases subscriber acquisition and reduces churn.", "normalised": "Partnerships offer a multi-faceted approach to value creation.

By understanding user preferences through OTT consumption data (with appropriate privacy safeguards, of course), telecom operators can tailor their services and advertising more effectively. This can lead to increased ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and enhanced customer satisfaction.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these partnerships facilitate data analytics and personalized offerings.

{"unnormalised": "The challenge, however, lies in ensuring equitable revenue sharing and avoiding becoming mere \"dumb pipes.\" Telecom operators must negotiate favorable terms with OTT platforms, ensuring a fair return on investment for the bandwidth and infrastructure they provide. Regulatory frameworks, similar to those advocated by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), need to evolve to address these new dynamics and prevent anti-competitive practices.", "normalised": "The challenge, however, lies in ensuring equitable revenue sharing and avoiding becoming mere \"dumb pipes.\" Telecom operators must negotiate favorable terms with O T T platforms, ensuring a fair return on investment for the bandwidth and infrastructure they provide.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, expect to see more innovative partnership models emerge. This could include joint content creation, integrated billing systems, and even the development of bespoke OTT platforms by telecom operators themselves. The key to success lies in forging mutually beneficial relationships that leverage the strengths of both telecom and OTT players, ultimately benefiting the Indian consumer with a richer and more diverse entertainment experience. The potential for growth in this sector is substantial, possibly reaching Rs. 40,000 Cr by 2025, according to some analysts. This makes strategic OTT partnerships an imperative, not just an option, for telecom companies operating in India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, expect to see more innovative partnership models emerge.
