The surge in popularity of OTT platforms like Hotstar, Zee5, and SonyLIV has significantly boosted data usage, particularly amongst the younger demographic. Telecom operators, such as Airtel and Jio, see OTT partnerships as a means to capitalize on this trend, offering bundled data plans with premium OTT subscriptions. These \"data plus content\" bundles are proving particularly effective in attracting and retaining subscribers in a highly competitive market. Imagine a Diwali offer: a free year of Zee5 premium with a Rs. 999 recharge!
