We're seeing companies like Airtel and Jio increasingly bundle subscriptions to services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney plus Hotstar with their data plans. Is this a sustainable long-term strategy, or a fleeting tactic to grab market share?"}

For telcos, it's a way to differentiate themselves in a fiercely competitive market. However, the revenue share agreements likely involve complex negotiations and could potentially impact profitability down the line."}

Will this stifle innovation and diversity in the Indian O T T landscape? What are your projections? I'd love to know your viewpoints on this. Are we heading towards a \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" (everyone wins) scenario, or are there potential downsides we need to consider? I have got an investment of rupee fifty thousand, and would want to know if partnering with a local telecom company in U P is the best use of it. The distance between the server and the consumers would be around one hundred kilometer."}
