Airtel's Xstream Premium bundling comes to mind immediately. Jio has been aggressively pursuing this strategy for years. Is this the future, or just a fleeting trend?"}

Is this the future, or just a fleeting trend?", "normalised": "My take is that these partnerships are crucial. Data usage is skyrocketing, fueled by shows like \"Family Man\" and the latest Bollywood blockbusters on platforms like Hotstar and Netflix. Telcos need to capitalize on this, but competing directly is difficult. Building a content library from scratch like in \"Guru\" would be a massive undertaking, requiring hundreds of crores in investment."}

O T T s get wider reach and customer acquisition channels, while Telcos boost data consumption and subscriber loyalty through bundled offerings. We might even see exclusive content deals tied to specific telecom providers in the near future."}

Profit sharing models need to be carefully negotiated. We also need to consider the impact on smaller, regional O T T players. What are your thoughts? Is this a sustainable strategy for the long term in the context of increasing data tariffs and the evolving regulatory landscape? Let’s discuss."}
