{"unnormalised": "**Telecom Sector Sees Uptick in Data Plan Consumption Amidst Festive Season**", "normalised": "New Delhi, October twenty six - Indian telecommunications providers are reporting a significant surge in data plan consumption, driven by the ongoing festive season and increasing smartphone penetration in rural areas. J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea have all witnessed a rise in subscribers opting for higher data limits, particularly plans offering two G B to three G B per day. Doctor Meena Sharma, a telecom analyst at the Indian Institute of Technology (I I T) Delhi, notes that the trend is fueled by increased online shopping, video streaming, and social media usage during Diwali and Durga Puja. \"Users are increasingly relying on mobile data for entertainment and communication, demanding richer experiences,\" she stated. Airtel recently announced a new data plan offering five hundred G B of data for rupee five hundred and ninety nine, targeting heavy data users. J I O countered with a plan providing seven hundred G B spread over three months. Meanwhile, the rollout of five G infrastructure, expected to cover five thousand square feet this quarter, is further anticipated to boost data consumption in metro cities. Analysts project a fifteen percent increase in average data consumption per user by the end of the year."}
