Which provider and plan do you find offers the best value for money, considering both data allowance and network reliability? Specifically, experiences in Tier two cities like Lucknow would be valuable. Also, has anyone noticed significant changes in data speeds after the introduction of five G at two P M on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty three, and is it worth upgrading to a five G enabled plan? My usage mostly consists of social media, online classes (starting at nine A M daily for my daughter at I I T coaching), and occasional video streaming. Your insights are greatly appreciated!"}
