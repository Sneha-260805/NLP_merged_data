{"unnormalised": "## Data Plan Debacles: A Call for Transparency in the Indian Telecom Sector", "normalised": "Namaste everyone. I am writing this post out of sheer frustration with the opaque nature of data plans offered by various telecom providers in India. I have been a loyal customer of Airtel for over five years, but lately, their data deductions have become incredibly erratic. My current plan, costing rupees seven hundred and ninety nine per month, promises one point five gigabyte of data per day. However, I routinely find myself running out of data well before the twenty four hour mark, despite minimal usage. Just yesterday, I used only WhatsApp for about thirty minutes, and it allegedly consumed five hundred megabyte. This is simply unacceptable. I have contacted Airtel customer care multiple times, but their explanations are consistently vague, often blaming \"background app activity\" or \"network congestion.\" This feels like a page straight out of a Bollywood masala film, where the villain always has an unconvincing alibi. I suspect there might be some data throttling or hidden charges at play. I have even run speed tests which show download speeds significantly lower than advertised, especially during peak hours in Mumbai. Is anyone else facing similar issues? Has anyone had success in resolving such discrepancies? Perhaps lodging a complaint with T R A I is the next step? I am contemplating switching to Jio, despite their potential privacy concerns, simply due to the perceived value for money. I am open to suggestions and would appreciate any insights you can offer. Perhaps a study by I I T-Delhi could shed some light on these discrepancies. Surely, a thorough investigation is warranted to ensure fair practices within the Indian telecom landscape."}
