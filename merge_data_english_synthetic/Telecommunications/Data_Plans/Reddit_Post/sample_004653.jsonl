I feel misled. What's the point of an \"unlimited\" plan if the post-F U P speed renders it virtually unusable? I tried contacting customer care on fourteenth February two thousand and twenty four at two thirty P M, but the resolution offered was unsatisfactory. They cited some obscure clause in the terms and conditions, which, frankly, are worded in a way that's difficult for the average person to understand."}

Shouldn't companies be obligated to provide specific numbers, not vague descriptions like \"reduced speeds\"? I am particularly interested in hearing from others who have experienced similar issues, perhaps even with Airtel or Vodafone Idea in cities like Mumbai or Delhi. Have you found a way to successfully navigate these ambiguous data plans? What remedies are available to a consumer who feels cheated by such practices? I wish we had better consumer protections, like in the U S or the U K. My bill this month was rupees five hundred and ninety nine, and I feel like I got ripped off. I will file a complaint at nine A M on sixteenth February two thousand and twenty four if I don't get any solution."}
