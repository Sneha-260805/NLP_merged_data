For instance, I reside in Gurgaon and require a minimum of 50 GB of data per month due to my work (mostly remote meetings which start around 09:00 hrs). The speed is also crucial as video calls often lag, a major problem when I'm discussing important strategies.", "normalised": "However, I am finding it increasingly difficult to navigate these options.

{"unnormalised": "What are your experiences with data plans? Are there any recommended plans that provide truly unlimited data (without hidden FUP limits) within a reasonable price range, particularly in metros like Delhi and Mumbai? Also, are there any initiatives aimed at improving rural connectivity outside of the BharatNet project?
