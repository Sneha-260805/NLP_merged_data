I recall a time, not so long ago – perhaps around two thousand and eighteen – when a monthly recharge of rupee three hundred and ninety nine provided substantial data with a reasonable F U P.

Does anyone have experience with prioritizing certain data types (video versus browsing) to mitigate this issue? I will be traveling to Mumbai on twenty sixth October two thousand and twenty four and am curious if network performance varies significantly between the two cities. Any recommendations regarding network performance near I I T Bombay would be highly appreciated. I am looking to make a decision by fifth November two thousand and twenty four at nine hundred hours. Dhanyavaad for your assistance."}
