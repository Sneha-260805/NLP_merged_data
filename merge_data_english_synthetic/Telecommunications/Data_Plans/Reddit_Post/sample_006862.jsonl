Are there any plans, particularly from lesser-known providers or perhaps BSNL (although I've heard their 4G availability is limited outside major cities like Kolkata), that offer comparable data at a lower price point? Any insights into truly unlimited data plans (without excessive throttling after a certain threshold) would also be greatly appreciated. I need to decide by 15/08/2024 (Independence Day!).
