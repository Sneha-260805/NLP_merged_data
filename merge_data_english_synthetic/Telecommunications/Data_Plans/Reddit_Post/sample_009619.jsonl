My current plan with Airtel is expiring on twentieth October two thousand and twenty four, and I am evaluating alternatives before renewing. My primary usage revolves around streaming videos (mostly Bollywood and regional cinema), video conferencing for work (typically between fourteen hundred hours and sixteen hundred hours), and general browsing.
