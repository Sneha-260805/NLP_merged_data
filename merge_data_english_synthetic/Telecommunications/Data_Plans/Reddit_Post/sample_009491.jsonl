I am writing to express my mounting frustration with mobile data plans in India, specifically the lack of true transparency and the feeling that advertised benefits rarely translate to real-world usability.", "normalised": "Namaste fellow Redditors.

{"unnormalised": "I've been a loyal user of Jio for several years, lured in initially by their promise of affordable 4G data after 15/08/1947 (yes, the irony isn't lost on me). However, lately, I've noticed a significant decline in speeds, particularly during peak hours, such as 19:00 hrs on weekdays. My plan promises \"unlimited\" data, but after crossing a seemingly arbitrary 2GB daily limit, the speed throttles down to a crawl, barely enough to even load a simple webpage.", "normalised": "I've been a loyal user of Jio for several years, lured in initially by their promise of affordable four G data after fifteenth august nineteen forty seven (yes, the irony isn't lost on me).

{"unnormalised": "I recently visited my daughter, Priya, in Bangalore, and even there, the performance was subpar. She uses Airtel and faces similar issues after reaching a certain data threshold. Is this a common experience across various operators? The advertised speeds often seem like a distant dream, especially when streaming content or engaging in video calls. I'm paying upwards of Rs. 600 per month for what feels like a severely limited service.", "normalised": "I recently visited my daughter, Priya, in Bangalore, and even there, the performance was subpar.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the terms and conditions are often buried deep within the fine print. Finding information on fair usage policies (FUP) and speed throttling specifics is like navigating the crowded streets of Delhi during rush hour! I feel like we, as consumers, deserve clearer communication from these telecom providers. Is there any movement advocating for greater transparency in data plan offerings in India? Perhaps a collective effort to hold these companies accountable? I need suggestions. This is getting ridiculous since 01/01/2024. Any advice would be welcome. My Village is 50 km from nearest city.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the terms and conditions are often buried deep within the fine print.
