While data prices have decreased significantly since, say, the pre-Jio era, the actual value proposition for many users, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities like Patna or Lucknow, seems to be diminishing.

What are your experiences with Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and BSNL? I am keen to hear your perspectives, especially regarding the validity of plans extending from 01/01/2024.
