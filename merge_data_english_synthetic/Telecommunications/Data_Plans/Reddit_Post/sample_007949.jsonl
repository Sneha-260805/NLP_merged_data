Currently, I'm on a plan that provides two gigabytes of data per day with a twenty eight day validity, costing approximately rupees two hundred and ninety nine. However, I often find myself running short towards the end of the cycle."}

I saw an offer providing five hundred gigabytes data for rupees three thousand valid for three hundred and sixty five days from Reliance Communications in two thousand and nineteen. Of course they're defunct now. Has anyone done the math and determined if that is a cheaper route? I need it for accessing my I I T Bombay lectures online."}
