{"unnormalised": "***", "normalised": "Namaste, fellow Redditors. I am initiating this thread to discuss the current state of data plans in India, and seek insights from your experiences. I have been observing a concerning trend - while data prices have ostensibly reduced since Reliance J I O's entry, the actual utility for the average consumer, like myself in Hyderabad, seems questionable. Many of us are subscribing to plans offering, say, two gigabyte per day for rupee two hundred and forty nine, valid for twenty eight days. However, hidden asterisks abound. Speed throttling after a certain 'fair usage' limit is common. Streaming a Bollywood film, like \"three Idiots\" in four K, becomes a frustrating exercise after just a few hours. My primary concern lies with the lack of transparency. Providers like Airtel and Vodafone-Idea often advertise headline data quotas but do not adequately disclose the throttling parameters. For those of us relying on mobile data for online classes at institutions like I I T Madras, consistent, high-speed access is crucial. Furthermore, the rural-urban divide persists. While four G penetration is increasing, speeds and reliability in Tier-two and Tier-three cities and villages (imagine someone in a remote village in Rajasthan using data) often lag significantly behind metros like Mumbai or Delhi. Has anyone else encountered similar issues? What strategies have you adopted to optimize your data usage or find more transparent and reliable data plans? I am particularly interested in hearing from users who have explored alternatives beyond the major providers. Looking forward to a fruitful discussion. Jai Hind!"}
