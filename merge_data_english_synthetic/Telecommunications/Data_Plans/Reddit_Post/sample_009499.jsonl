My current provider, A I R T E L, offers a plan with two G B per day for rupee six hundred and ninety nine per month.

This usually happens every month between tenth and fifteenth."}

My current bill arrived on twentieth July two thousand and twenty four, and I need to switch before it auto-renews! Jai Hind!"}
