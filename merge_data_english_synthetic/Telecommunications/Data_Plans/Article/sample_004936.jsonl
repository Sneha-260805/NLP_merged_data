{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (e.g., 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, 365 days), data allowance (measured in GBs), and bundled benefits like voice calls and SMS. Major telecom operators such as Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer a plethora of options catering to diverse needs and usage patterns.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (e.g., twenty eight days, fifty six days, eighty four days, three hundred and sixty five days), data allowance (measured in G B s), and bundled benefits like voice calls and S M S.

{"unnormalised": "One key factor influencing the price of a data plan is the daily data limit. Plans offering 1 GB per day are common, while heavier users might opt for 2 GB or even 3 GB daily plans. Post the exhaustion of the daily limit, speeds are typically reduced to a significantly lower speed, often referred to as FUP (Fair Usage Policy) speed, allowing basic browsing and messaging, but hindering activities like video streaming. Some plans offer unlimited data at reduced speeds after the daily limit.", "normalised": "One key factor influencing the price of a data plan is the daily data limit. Plans offering one G B per day are common, while heavier users might opt for two G B or even three G B daily plans.

{"unnormalised": "Another aspect to consider is the validity period. A 28-day plan might seem cheaper initially, but could end up costing more in the long run compared to a 56-day or 84-day plan with similar daily data limits. Consumers must calculate the total data offered over the entire validity period and compare the per-GB cost to determine the most economical option.", "normalised": "Another aspect to consider is the validity period.

For entertainment enthusiasts, these bundled offerings can significantly enhance the value proposition.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of 5G technology is also impacting data plan offerings. 5G plans generally come with higher data limits and faster speeds, catering to the increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications. However, these plans are typically priced higher than 4G plans and require a 5G-enabled device and network coverage in the area.", "normalised": "The rise of 5 G technology is also impacting data plan offerings. 5 G plans generally come with higher data limits and faster speeds, catering to the increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications.

{"unnormalised": "In rural areas, data plans often face challenges due to network infrastructure limitations. While operators are working to expand 4G and 5G coverage, consumers in these regions may have to rely on more basic plans with lower data allowances. The Digital India initiative aims to bridge this digital divide by promoting affordable data access and digital literacy in rural India. Imagine sharing a delicious plate of biryani with loved ones while video calling them, facilitated by a reliable and affordable data plan. It's connectivity that brings people closer, regardless of distance. Data plan rates start from as low as Rs. 149 for 1 GB per day for 28 days, going up to Rs. 2999 for annual plans offering 2GB per day. Coverage extends to places as remote as 500 km from Chennai. Navigating these options requires careful consideration of individual needs and usage patterns to ensure optimal value for money.", "normalised": "In rural areas, data plans often face challenges due to network infrastructure limitations.
