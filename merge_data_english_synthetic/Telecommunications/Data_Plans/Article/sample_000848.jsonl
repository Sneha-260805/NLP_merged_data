{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are generally categorized based on several factors. Firstly, the **data allowance** is paramount. This is measured in GBs (Gigabytes) and dictates how much data you can consume within a specific validity period. Plans range from low data offerings, suitable for light users checking WhatsApp or email, to high data plans catering to heavy users who stream videos, participate in video calls, and download large files. Jio, for instance, offers plans starting from around Rs. 149 for 1 GB per day, valid for 20 days, going up to plans with multiple GBs per day.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are generally categorized based on several factors. Firstly, the **data allowance** is paramount. This is measured in G B-s (Gigabytes) and dictates how much data you can consume within a specific validity period. Plans range from low data offerings, suitable for light users checking WhatsApp or email, to high data plans catering to heavy users who stream videos, participate in video calls, and download large files. J-i-o, for instance, offers plans starting from around rupee one hundred and forty nine for one G B per day, valid for twenty days, going up to plans with multiple G B-s per day."}
{"unnormalised": "Secondly, **validity** plays a significant role. Plans typically have a validity period of 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, or even 365 days. Choose a validity period that aligns with your usage patterns to avoid unnecessary top-ups and potential data wastage. Many users in metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Delhi opt for shorter validity plans due to frequent recharges.", "normalised": "Secondly, **validity** plays a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, **speed** influences the user experience. While 4G is widespread, 5G is rapidly expanding, promising significantly faster download and upload speeds. However, access to 5G speeds depends on your handset's compatibility and the availability of 5G network coverage in your area.

This is crucial to avoid throttled speeds after your primary data limit is reached.
