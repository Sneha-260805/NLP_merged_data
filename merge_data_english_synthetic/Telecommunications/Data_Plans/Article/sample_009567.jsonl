{"unnormalised": "Data plans are essentially agreements between a telecom service provider (TSP) and a customer, outlining the amount of data (measured in GB or MB) that can be used over a specific period (usually monthly) for a predetermined price. Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are the dominant players in the Indian market, constantly innovating and revising their data offerings to attract and retain customers. These plans vary widely in terms of data allowance, validity, speed (Mbps), and bundled services like voice calls and SMS.", "normalised": "Data plans are essentially agreements between a telecom service provider (T S P) and a customer, outlining the amount of data (measured in gigabyte or megabyte) that can be used over a specific period (usually monthly) for a predetermined price.

{"unnormalised": "Factors influencing the design and pricing of data plans include spectrum availability, infrastructure costs, competition, and government regulations. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a crucial role in ensuring fair pricing and transparency in the sector. For instance, TRAI has mandated clear communication of data speeds and fair usage policies (FUP) to protect consumers from deceptive practices.", "normalised": "Factors influencing the design and pricing of data plans include spectrum availability, infrastructure costs, competition, and government regulations.

{"unnormalised": "A typical data plan for a college student in Delhi might offer 2 GB of data per day for Rs. 299 with a validity of 28 days. A professional in Bengaluru, who relies heavily on mobile data for work, might opt for a plan with 50 GB of monthly data for Rs. 599, bundled with unlimited calling. In rural areas, where network coverage might be limited, TSPs often offer cheaper plans with smaller data allowances, targeting price-sensitive consumers.", "normalised": "A typical data plan for a college student in Delhi might offer two gigabyte of data per day for rupee two hundred and ninety nine with a validity of twenty eight days.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the development of 5G technology is poised to revolutionize data plans in India. 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications like augmented reality and virtual reality. Dr. Sharma, a leading researcher at IIT Madras, predicts that 5G data plans will be priced competitively, offering a significant upgrade in performance for users across the country. However, the rollout of 5G infrastructure is still underway, and its impact on data plan pricing and availability remains to be seen. Many are constructing new cell towers, requiring land of approximately 1000 sq ft for each installation.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the development of five G technology is poised to revolutionize data plans in India.
