{"unnormalised": "The core function of a data plan is to provide a specific amount of data (measured in Gigabytes, GB, or Megabytes, MB) for a defined period, typically 28 days or 30 days, though monthly plans are also available. The pricing of these plans varies significantly depending on the data allowance, validity period, and bundled benefits. Operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) constantly compete to offer the most attractive plans, engaging in price wars that benefit the end consumer. We remember the disruption caused by Jio's launch on 05/09/2016, which radically altered the data plan landscape.", "normalised": "The core function of a data plan is to provide a specific amount of data (measured in Gigabytes, G B, or Megabytes, M B) for a defined period, typically twenty eight days or thirty days, though monthly plans are also available.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond just data allowance, many plans now offer additional benefits like unlimited voice calls (local and STD), access to streaming services (such as Zee5 or Hotstar), and complimentary SMS. Some operators also offer data rollover options, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next cycle, preventing wastage. For example, a plan costing Rs. 499 might offer 2 GB of data per day, unlimited calling, and a subscription to a streaming platform for 28 days. A user working from home in Bengaluru might consume significantly more data than someone primarily using their phone for WhatsApp in a rural village in Rajasthan.", "normalised": "Beyond just data allowance, many plans now offer additional benefits like unlimited voice calls (local and S T D), access to streaming services (such as Zee five or Hotstar), and complimentary S M S.

{"unnormalised": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand for customized data plans that cater to specific user needs. Some operators offer data top-ups for users who exhaust their data allowance before the validity period ends. Other specialized plans are designed for heavy data users, such as gamers or video streamers, offering unlimited data or significantly larger data allowances. Consider a student at IIT Delhi needing high speed internet at 14:00 hrs for an online lecture - a suitable data plan becomes crucial.", "normalised": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand for customized data plans that cater to specific user needs.
