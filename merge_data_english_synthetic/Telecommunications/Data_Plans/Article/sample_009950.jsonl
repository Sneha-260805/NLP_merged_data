A typical 1GB data pack could cost upwards of Rs. 250, putting it out of reach for many. However, the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 (01/09/2016) revolutionized the market. Jio offered incredibly cheap data and free voice calls, forcing other telecom operators like Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and BSNL to drastically reduce their prices to remain competitive.
