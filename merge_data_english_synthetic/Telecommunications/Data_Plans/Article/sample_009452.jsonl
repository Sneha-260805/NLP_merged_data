{"unnormalised": "Data plans are fundamental to the modern Indian telecommunications experience, connecting millions across the vast expanse from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. These plans, offered by telecom providers like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), dictate the amount of data a subscriber can use over a specific period, typically a month, influencing everything from streaming Bollywood movies to conducting online business.", "normalised": "Data plans are fundamental to the modern Indian telecommunications experience, connecting millions across the vast expanse from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian data market is fiercely competitive, resulting in a wide array of plans catering to diverse needs and budgets. A basic plan might offer 1GB of data per day for Rs. 199, while a premium plan could provide unlimited data (subject to fair usage policy) for Rs. 799, along with benefits like bundled OTT subscriptions such as Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video. The \"Fair Usage Policy\" (FUP) is a crucial element, throttling speeds once the daily or monthly data limit is reached, often down to a frustratingly slow 64 kbps.", "normalised": "The Indian data market is fiercely competitive, resulting in a wide array of plans catering to diverse needs and budgets.

{"unnormalised": "Factors influencing data plan pricing include data allowance, validity period, calling minutes (often unlimited these days), SMS benefits, and bundled services. For instance, JioFiber, the broadband arm of Reliance Jio, offers plans with speeds ranging from 30 Mbps to 1 Gbps, catering to households requiring significant bandwidth for multiple devices and heavy usage, perhaps in a 2,000 sq ft apartment in Mumbai.", "normalised": "Factors influencing data plan pricing include data allowance, validity period, calling minutes (often unlimited these days), S M S benefits, and bundled services.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration. A student residing in a hostel near IIT Delhi, primarily using data for online lectures and social media, might find a daily 1.5 GB plan sufficient. A businessman, Dr. Sharma, constantly on the move and relying on mobile data for video conferencing and accessing cloud-based documents, would likely need a plan with higher data allowance and reliable network coverage across various cities like Chennai and Kolkata.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration.
