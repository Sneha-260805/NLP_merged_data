{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic Indian telecommunications sector, data plans form the backbone of connectivity, enabling access to the internet for a vast population. These plans, offered by telecom service providers like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), are structured packages providing a specified volume of data for a defined validity period at a particular price point. Selecting the right data plan involves understanding various factors, including data consumption patterns, budget constraints, and network availability in your area, say, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.", "normalised": "In the dynamic Indian telecommunications sector, data plans form the backbone of connectivity, enabling access to the internet for a vast population.

{"unnormalised": "A typical data plan consists of a data allowance (measured in GB), validity (ranging from a day to a year), and often bundled services like unlimited voice calls and SMS. Post the exhaustion of the allocated data, users might experience a reduction in speed (data throttling) or be charged extra for exceeding the limit, currently priced around Rs. 0.50 per MB. Many plans also incorporate fair usage policies (FUP) limiting daily data usage or specific types of traffic.", "normalised": "A typical data plan consists of a data allowance (measured in G-B), validity (ranging from a day to a year), and often bundled services like unlimited voice calls and S-M-S.

{"unnormalised": "The data plan landscape in India is fiercely competitive. Operators continually innovate by introducing new plans and revising existing ones to attract and retain customers. Examples include plans offering \"unlimited\" data (subject to FUP limitations), data rollover features, and even bundled subscriptions to OTT platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. For example, Airtel offers a Rs. 499 plan with 2 GB data per day, unlimited calls, and Disney+ Hotstar access, valid for 28 days. Jio, on the other hand, has a Rs. 555 plan providing 84 GB of data with 84 days validity. Vi often tries to distinguish itself with offers targeted at weekend usage.", "normalised": "The data plan landscape in India is fiercely competitive.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration. Firstly, estimate your average monthly data usage. Streaming videos (especially in HD), downloading large files, and online gaming consume significant amounts of data. Secondly, consider your calling patterns. While most plans now offer unlimited voice calls, check for any restrictions on off-net calls (calls to other networks). Thirdly, compare the offerings of different operators in your locality. Network coverage and speeds vary significantly, particularly in rural areas or hilly regions like those near Shimla.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration.
