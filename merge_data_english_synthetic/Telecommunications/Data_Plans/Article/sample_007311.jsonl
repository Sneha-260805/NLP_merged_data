{"unnormalised": "Data plans, offered by telecommunication service providers like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), essentially provide a pre-defined amount of data (measured in GB or TB) for a specific validity period. These plans can be broadly categorized into prepaid and postpaid offerings. Prepaid plans require upfront payment and are popular for their flexibility and cost control. Postpaid plans, on the other hand, involve monthly billing based on usage.", "normalised": "Data plans, offered by telecommunication service providers like Reliance J-i-o, A-i-r-t-e-l, and Vodafone Idea (V-i), essentially provide a pre-defined amount of data (measured in G-B or T-B) for a specific validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence the design and pricing of data plans. These include data allowance, validity (ranging from daily to annual plans), speed (2G, 3G, 4G, and increasingly 5G), and bundled benefits such as unlimited calling (local and STD), SMS, and access to Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms like Disney+ Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video.", "normalised": "Several factors influence the design and pricing of data plans.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecom market is characterized by intense competition, leading to frequent updates and revisions of data plans. For instance, on 01/01/2023, Reliance Jio announced revised tariff plans offering increased data allowances for its users in Mumbai. Similarly, Airtel launched a new data plan specifically targeted towards students preparing for competitive exams like the IIT-JEE on 10/05/2023. These plans often include additional features like access to educational content or free data during off-peak hours (e.g., between 02:00 hrs and 06:00 hrs).", "normalised": "The Indian telecom market is characterized by intense competition, leading to frequent updates and revisions of data plans.

{"unnormalised": "Data allowance is a crucial consideration. Heavy users who frequently stream videos, participate in video conferences, or download large files should opt for plans with higher data limits. Conversely, light users who primarily use data for messaging and social media browsing can opt for more economical plans. It is important to monitor data usage regularly using the service provider's app or website to avoid exceeding the allotted data and incurring additional charges, which can often be quite substantial. Some plans also offer data rollover benefits, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle.", "normalised": "Data allowance is a crucial consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the rollout of 5G technology across major Indian cities like Delhi, Bangalore, and Kolkata is significantly impacting data plan offerings. 5G plans typically offer much higher speeds and lower latency compared to 4G plans, catering to users who require high-bandwidth applications like gaming or augmented reality. However, these plans also tend to be more expensive. The availability of 5G services and compatible devices will be a key determinant of the widespread adoption of 5G data plans. Many users across the Ganges plains are yet to use 4G services.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the rollout of five G technology across major Indian cities like Delhi, Bangalore, and Kolkata is significantly impacting data plan offerings. Five G plans typically offer much higher speeds and lower latency compared to four G plans, catering to users who require high-bandwidth applications like gaming or augmented reality. However, these plans also tend to be more expensive. The availability of five G services and compatible devices will be a key determinant of the widespread adoption of five G data plans. Many users across the Ganges plains are yet to use four G services."}
