{"unnormalised": "Data plans are the lifeblood of modern telecommunications, particularly in India where mobile connectivity is paramount. These plans, offered by various operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), dictate the amount of data a user can consume over a specific period, typically a month or even daily. Understanding the intricacies of these plans is crucial for consumers to optimize their internet usage and avoid hefty overage charges.", "normalised": "Data plans are the lifeblood of modern telecommunications, particularly in India where mobile connectivity is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "In India, data plans are fiercely competitive, with operators constantly innovating to attract and retain customers. Plans can range from basic offerings providing a mere 1 GB per month for Rs. 79 to more comprehensive packages boasting several GBs per day, priced upwards of Rs. 599. The cost per GB has plummeted dramatically in recent years, driven by Reliance Jio's disruptive entry into the market, making internet access significantly more affordable for the average Indian citizen.", "normalised": "In India, data plans are fiercely competitive, with operators constantly innovating to attract and retain customers.

{"unnormalised": "Factors influencing the choice of a data plan include daily data limits, validity period, bundled services, and network coverage. Many plans now come bundled with unlimited calling (local and STD), a significant perk for users who frequently make voice calls. Some plans also offer access to premium content such as streaming services like Zee5 or Hotstar, appealing to entertainment-focused users.", "normalised": "Factors influencing the choice of a data plan include daily data limits, validity period, bundled services, and network coverage.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several nuances are important. For example, \"unlimited\" plans often come with a fair usage policy (FUP), which reduces the speed to a crawl (e.g., 64 kbps) after a certain data threshold is reached. This can be frustrating for users who rely on high-speed internet throughout the month. Moreover, data rollover options, where unused data from one month is carried forward to the next, are becoming increasingly popular.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several nuances are important.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian telecommunications sector is poised for further growth with the rollout of 5G technology. 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, opening up new possibilities for applications like augmented reality, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As 5G becomes more prevalent, data plans will undoubtedly evolve to cater to the demands of these emerging technologies, potentially offering plans with terabytes of data or specialized data packages for specific applications. Institutions like IIT Madras are actively involved in research and development related to 5G technology, shaping the future of data consumption in India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian telecommunications sector is poised for further growth with the rollout of five G technology.
