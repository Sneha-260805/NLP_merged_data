{"unnormalised": "Essentially, a data plan is an agreement between a subscriber and a telecom operator, like Jio, Airtel, or Vodafone Idea (Vi), granting access to a specified amount of mobile data over a defined period, typically 28 days or a month. This data is measured in Gigabytes (GB) and is consumed when browsing the internet, streaming videos on Hotstar, using social media like Instagram, or even sending WhatsApp messages.", "normalised": "Essentially, a data plan is an agreement between a subscriber and a telecom operator, like J I O, Airtel, or Vodafone Idea (V I), granting access to a specified amount of mobile data over a defined period, typically twenty eight days or a month.

{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are generally prepaid, meaning users pay in advance for the service. Postpaid options, however, are also available, often catering to corporate clients or individuals with higher data consumption needs. The cost of data plans varies widely, ranging from basic packs offering 1 GB per day for Rs. 249 to more comprehensive plans with unlimited data (subject to Fair Usage Policy - FUP) for Rs. 799.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are generally prepaid, meaning users pay in advance for the service.

{"unnormalised": "The FUP is a crucial aspect to consider. While advertised as \"unlimited,\" these plans often throttle speeds significantly after a certain data threshold is reached, typically 2 GB per day. After crossing this limit, speeds can plummet to a crawl, resembling the dial-up era of the late 90s, making video streaming a frustrating experience.", "normalised": "The F U P is a crucial aspect to consider.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, users should be mindful of validity periods. Many attractive-looking plans come with short validity periods, requiring frequent recharges. Compare plans carefully, paying attention to the cost per GB and the overall validity period to arrive at a cost-effective solution. For example, a plan offering 1.5 GB per day for 84 days at Rs. 599 might be more economical than a plan offering 2 GB per day for 28 days at Rs. 299, depending on your usage patterns.", "normalised": "Furthermore, users should be mindful of validity periods.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond data limits and validity, consider the network coverage provided by the operator in your area. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, emphasizes, \"A cheaper plan with spotty network coverage is ultimately more expensive than a slightly pricier plan with reliable connectivity.\" He lives in a relatively remote area, 150 km outside Delhi, where network signals can be weak. Also, for residents of densely populated metropolitan areas like Mumbai, where real estate is priced at Rs. 50,000 per sq ft, optimizing data usage to avoid unnecessary expenses is a sensible financial decision. Finally, look out for additional benefits like bundled SMS, calls, and access to streaming platforms which can add value to the plan. Carefully evaluating these factors will help you navigate the complexities and choose a data plan that truly meets your needs and budget in the dynamic Indian telecommunications market.", "normalised": "Beyond data limits and validity, consider the network coverage provided by the operator in your area.
