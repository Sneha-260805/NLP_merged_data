{"unnormalised": "Data plans are fundamental to modern telecommunications, particularly in India, where mobile data consumption is among the highest globally. These plans, offered by telecom operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), provide subscribers with a pre-defined amount of data, measured in gigabytes (GB), accessible within a specific validity period. Selecting the right data plan is crucial for managing costs and ensuring uninterrupted connectivity for activities ranging from online banking to streaming Bollywood movies.", "normalised": "Data plans are fundamental to modern telecommunications, particularly in India, where mobile data consumption is among the highest globally.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecom market is fiercely competitive, resulting in a diverse range of data plans catering to different user needs. These plans typically vary based on data allowance, validity, calling minutes, SMS quotas, and bundled value-added services such as subscriptions to OTT platforms like Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video. A student in Delhi, for example, might opt for a plan offering 1.5 GB of data per day for Rs. 249 with a 28-day validity, while a business professional in Mumbai requiring constant connectivity might choose a plan with higher data limits and added benefits.", "normalised": "The Indian telecom market is fiercely competitive, resulting in a diverse range of data plans catering to different user needs. These plans typically vary based on data allowance, validity, calling minutes, S-M-S quotas, and bundled value-added services such as subscriptions to O-T-T platforms like Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video. A student in Delhi, for example, might opt for a plan offering one point five G-B of data per day for rupee two hundred and forty nine with a twenty eight-day validity, while a business professional in Mumbai requiring constant connectivity might choose a plan with higher data limits and added benefits."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond daily data limits, several operators offer unlimited data plans, although these often come with fair usage policies (FUP). After exceeding the FUP limit, typically around 100GB or 200GB, the data speed is significantly reduced, impacting streaming and other bandwidth-intensive activities.", "normalised": "Beyond daily data limits, several operators offer unlimited data plans, although these often come with fair usage policies (F-U-P). After exceeding the F-U-P limit, typically around one hundred G-B or two hundred G-B, the data speed is significantly reduced, impacting streaming and other bandwidth-intensive activities."}
{"unnormalised": "Factors influencing data plan pricing include spectrum costs, infrastructure investments, and competitive pressures. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a vital role in regulating the sector, ensuring fair practices and consumer protection.", "normalised": "Factors influencing data plan pricing include spectrum costs, infrastructure investments, and competitive pressures.

With 5G offering significantly higher speeds and lower latency compared to 4G, we can expect to see data plans tailored to leverage these advancements. For instance, a user utilizing augmented reality applications in a 500 sq ft retail space in Bangalore would likely require a robust 5G data plan.", "normalised": "The rise of five G technology is expected to further transform the data plan landscape.
