{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of several factors. Firstly, individual usage patterns play a significant role. A student in Delhi using online learning platforms may require a significantly larger data allowance compared to a senior citizen in Kochi primarily using messaging apps. Secondly, the specific services consumed are important. Streaming high-definition videos on platforms like Hotstar or JioCinema consumes considerably more data than browsing social media or sending emails.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of several factors.

{"unnormalised": "Indian telecom operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) constantly update their data plans to remain competitive. These plans are typically categorized based on validity (daily, weekly, monthly, annual), data allowance (ranging from a few GBs to unlimited plans), and bundled benefits (e.g., free calls, SMS, subscriptions to OTT platforms). For instance, a typical Jio plan might offer 2GB of data per day for Rs. 299 with a validity of 28 days, along with unlimited voice calls. Airtel might offer a similar plan for Rs. 319 with slightly different bundled benefits.", "normalised": "Indian telecom operators like J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I) constantly update their data plans to remain competitive. These plans are typically categorized based on validity (daily, weekly, monthly, annual), data allowance (ranging from a few gigabytes to unlimited plans), and bundled benefits (e g, free calls, S M S, subscriptions to O T T platforms). For instance, a typical J I O plan might offer two gigabytes of data per day for rupee two hundred and ninety nine with a validity of twenty eight days, along with unlimited voice calls. Airtel might offer a similar plan for rupee three hundred and nineteen with slightly different bundled benefits."}
{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect often overlooked is the fine print. Many plans come with fair usage policies (FUP), which throttle speeds after a certain data limit is reached. While unlimited data plans are advertised, they often impose significant speed reductions after a specific threshold, impacting user experience. Customers should carefully examine the FUP details before subscribing.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect often overlooked is the fine print.

{"unnormalised": "During festive seasons, like Diwali or Onam, telecom operators often introduce special data plans and offers.

{"unnormalised": "Another important factor to consider is the network coverage provided by the operator. While a plan might be attractively priced, poor network coverage in specific areas can render it useless. Users living in rural areas or frequently traveling to remote locations should prioritize operators with wider network coverage.", "normalised": "Another important factor to consider is the network coverage provided by the operator.

{"unnormalised": "With the advent of 5G technology, data consumption is expected to increase further. Telecom operators are already rolling out 5G data plans, offering significantly higher speeds and lower latency. However, these plans are currently priced higher than 4G plans and are primarily targeted at users with 5G-enabled devices and a need for high-bandwidth applications. For example, a 5G data plan might cost Rs. 799 for 50GB of high-speed data, compared to a 4G plan offering similar data at a lower price.", "normalised": "With the advent of five G technology, data consumption is expected to increase further. Telecom operators are already rolling out five G data plans, offering significantly higher speeds and lower latency. However, these plans are currently priced higher than four G plans and are primarily targeted at users with five G-enabled devices and a need for high-bandwidth applications. For example, a five G data plan might cost rupee seven hundred and ninety nine for fifty gigabytes of high-speed data, compared to a four G plan offering similar data at a lower price."}
{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the best data plan is the one that aligns with individual needs and budget. Comparing plans from different operators, understanding the fine print, and considering network coverage are essential steps in making an informed decision. Whether you are enjoying a plate of biryani while streaming a movie or attending a virtual meeting, choosing the right data plan ensures a seamless and connected experience in the digital age. The average Indian consumer uses around 17 GB of data per month in 2023.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the best data plan is the one that aligns with individual needs and budget.
