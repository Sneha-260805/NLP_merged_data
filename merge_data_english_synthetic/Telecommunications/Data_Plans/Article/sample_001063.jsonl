{"unnormalised": "Gone are the days of painstakingly calculating Kb usage. Today, Indian consumers demand substantial data allowances for streaming Bollywood movies, connecting on social media, and conducting business. Consequently, operators offer daily, weekly, monthly, and even annual data plans. A typical daily plan might offer 1.5GB of data per day for Rs. 249, bundled with unlimited calling and SMS benefits. Monthly plans, on the other hand, can range from Rs. 399 for 50GB to Rs. 799 for 150GB, often with over-the-top (OTT) subscriptions to services like Disney+ Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video Mobile Edition.", "normalised": "Gone are the days of painstakingly calculating kilobyte usage.

{"unnormalised": "The data allowance isn't the only factor to consider. Speed is paramount. 4G networks are prevalent, offering decent speeds in most urban areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. However, the rollout of 5G promises even faster speeds, enabling seamless video conferencing and smoother streaming experiences. While 5G plans are currently more expensive, they offer significantly improved performance, particularly for data-intensive applications. Imagine Dr. Sharma being able to conduct a remote consultation from his clinic in Kolkata with near-zero latency thanks to 5G.", "normalised": "The data allowance isn't the only factor to consider.

Once the allocated data limit is exhausted, speeds are typically throttled significantly, often to a frustratingly slow 64 Kbps or 128 Kbps. This can render online activities virtually impossible. Understanding the FUP is essential to avoid unexpected slowdowns. Some plans offer data add-ons that can be purchased to restore high-speed access.", "normalised": "Fair Usage Policy (F U P) limits are also critical.

These added perks can enhance the overall value proposition. For example, a Vi plan might offer weekend data rollover, allowing unused data from weekdays to be used on weekends, providing a significant advantage for users in cities like Chennai or Hyderabad who tend to consume more data during their leisure time.", "normalised": "Furthermore, bundled benefits like complimentary access to music streaming services (Gaana, Spotify), anti-virus software, or even cloud storage are becoming increasingly common.

Enterprises require reliable and high-speed internet access for various operations, from cloud computing to remote collaboration. Data plans catering to business needs often offer larger data allowances, priority network access, and dedicated customer support.
