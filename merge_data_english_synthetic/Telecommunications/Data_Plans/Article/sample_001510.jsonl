{"unnormalised": "Data plans offered by prominent telecom operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) generally fall into several categories. These include daily data plans (offering a fixed amount of data per day), bundled plans (combining data with voice calls and SMS), and unlimited data plans (subject to fair usage policies). The pricing of these plans varies depending on the data allowance, validity period, and additional benefits offered. For instance, a typical daily data plan might offer 1.5 GB of data per day for a validity of 28 days, costing approximately Rs. 249. Many plans now come with bundled OTT subscriptions, like Disney+ Hotstar, appealing to the entertainment-loving Indian populace.", "normalised": "Data plans offered by prominent telecom operators like J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I) generally fall into several categories.

{"unnormalised": "The introduction of 4G technology revolutionized data consumption in India. The average data consumption per user surged, creating a fierce competition among telecom operators to offer the most attractive data plans. The arrival of Jio in 2016 triggered a price war, forcing other players to drastically reduce their tariffs. This led to a significant increase in internet penetration, especially in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, empowering individuals and businesses alike. The launch date, 05/09/2016, is etched in the memory of many as the day affordable data became a reality.", "normalised": "The introduction of four G technology revolutionized data consumption in India.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of 5G technology is expected to further transform the data landscape. 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). While 5G rollout is underway in major cities like Delhi and Mumbai, it's still early days, and the impact on data plan pricing and structure is yet to be fully realized. Initial 5G data plans are generally priced higher, reflecting the higher cost of infrastructure deployment.", "normalised": "The implementation of five G technology is expected to further transform the data landscape.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Data speeds can often be inconsistent, especially during peak hours. The fair usage policies imposed on unlimited data plans can also be restrictive, throttling speeds after a certain data threshold is reached. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a crucial role in regulating the sector and ensuring fair competition and consumer protection. At a meeting scheduled for 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2024, TRAI is expected to deliberate on measures to improve data quality and transparency in billing.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

Initiatives like the Digital India campaign are crucial in bridging this digital divide and ensuring that everyone can benefit from affordable and accessible data. The BharatNet project, aiming to connect all villages with high-speed internet, is another key initiative in this direction, hoping to achieve full connectivity by 31/12/2025. The future of data plans in India hinges on continued innovation, infrastructure development, and a focus on affordability and accessibility for all.", "normalised": "Furthermore, digital literacy remains a barrier for some segments of the population, particularly in rural areas.
