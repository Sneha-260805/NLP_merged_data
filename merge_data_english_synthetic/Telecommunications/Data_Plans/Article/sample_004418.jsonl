While plans may advertise high-speed 4G or even 5G connectivity, throttling after exceeding the daily or monthly data cap is a common practice. Understanding the fair usage policy (FUP) is vital to avoid experiencing significantly reduced speeds. For example, a plan might offer 5GB data per day at 100 Mbps, but reduce the speed to 64 kbps after the daily limit is exhausted.", "normalised": "Data limits and speed are the key factors to consider. While plans may advertise high-speed four G or even five G connectivity, throttling after exceeding the daily or monthly data cap is a common practice.
