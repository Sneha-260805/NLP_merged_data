{"unnormalised": "Several factors have contributed to the proliferation of data plans in India. The advent of 4G and now the nascent rollout of 5G, spearheaded by companies like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, has dramatically increased data speeds and capacity. Simultaneously, the plummeting cost of smartphones, often subsidized through schemes like 'Digital India,' has placed internet access within reach of a wider segment of the population.", "normalised": "Several factors have contributed to the proliferation of data plans in India.

{"unnormalised": "Indian data plans typically operate on a prepaid or postpaid model. Prepaid plans offer flexibility and control over spending, while postpaid plans often bundle in additional benefits like family sharing or OTT subscriptions. The pricing structure is fiercely competitive, with providers constantly innovating to offer the \"best value for money.\" Common offerings include daily data allowances (e.g., 1.5GB/day), bundled voice calls, and SMS messages.", "normalised": "Indian data plans typically operate on a prepaid or postpaid model.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Network congestion, particularly in densely populated urban areas, can lead to slower data speeds and frustrating user experiences. Ensuring consistent and reliable connectivity across the vast and diverse geography of India requires continuous investment in infrastructure and technological upgrades. Concerns about data privacy and security also necessitate robust regulatory oversight. The average data usage per subscriber is on the rise, reaching levels of around 17GB per month in some regions, fueling the need for even more robust and innovative data plan offerings. We can expect to see new iterations and further innovation, especially with the development of 5G infrastructure across the country.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
