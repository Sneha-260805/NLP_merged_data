{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India vary significantly across providers like Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and BSNL. These plans differ in several key aspects: data allowance (daily/monthly limits), validity period (ranging from a few days to a year), speed (2G, 3G, 4G, and increasingly, 5G), and bundled services (voice calls, SMS, and access to OTT platforms). For instance, a Jio plan might offer 2 GB of data per day for 28 days, while an Airtel plan could provide unlimited data (with fair usage policy caveats) for a shorter duration.", "normalised": "Data plans in India vary significantly across providers like Reliance J-i-o, Airtel, Vodafone Idea (V-i), and B-S-N-L.

For instance, a J-i-o plan might offer two gigabyte of data per day for twenty eight days, while an Airtel plan could provide unlimited data (with fair usage policy caveats) for a shorter duration."}
{"unnormalised": "The pricing of these plans is another critical factor. The average cost of data in India is among the lowest globally, thanks to intense competition. However, consumers must be wary of hidden charges, such as data overage fees, and carefully analyze the total cost of ownership. Some plans also offer \"data rollover\" benefits, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle – a feature highly valued by cost-conscious consumers.", "normalised": "The pricing of these plans is another critical factor.

{"unnormalised": "Increasingly, telecom operators are bundling data plans with access to entertainment content. Many offer subscriptions to streaming services like Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, or Zee5, making these plans attractive to avid consumers of online entertainment.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of 5G technology is poised to further revolutionize the data plan landscape. 5G-enabled plans promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency, opening up new possibilities for applications like augmented reality, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT). While 5G coverage is still expanding, particularly beyond major urban centers, expect a gradual shift towards 5G-centric data plans in the coming years. Initial 5G plans might be priced at a premium, potentially costing upwards of Rs. 500 for a month, depending on the data allowance.", "normalised": "The rise of five G technology is poised to further revolutionize the data plan landscape. five G enabled plans promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency, opening up new possibilities for applications like augmented reality, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (I-o-T).

Initial five G plans might be priced at a premium, potentially costing upwards of rupee five hundred for a month, depending on the data allowance."}
{"unnormalised": "For many, especially during festival seasons like Onam, staying connected with family and friends back home is paramount. Data plans facilitate video calls, sharing photos and videos, and participating in online celebrations. With ever-evolving options, diligent research is key to finding the optimal data plan that suits individual needs and budget constraints, ensuring seamless connectivity in the digital age. Remember to compare offers from different providers, paying close attention to data limits, speed restrictions after reaching a certain threshold (e.g., dropping from 4G to 2G after 100 GB), and any additional perks like access to JioCinema or Airtel Xstream.", "normalised": "For many, especially during festival seasons like Onam, staying connected with family and friends back home is paramount.
