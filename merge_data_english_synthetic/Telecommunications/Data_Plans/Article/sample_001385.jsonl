{"unnormalised": "One of the primary considerations is the data allowance itself. Plans range from daily quotas of 1GB or 2GB, ideal for light users who primarily browse social media and use messaging apps, to larger monthly allotments of 50GB or even 100GB, suitable for heavy streamers, online gamers, and those working remotely. Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are the major players in this arena, each offering competitive packages. Jio, for example, often bundles its data plans with access to JioCinema and JioSaavn, providing additional entertainment value. Airtel, similarly, might offer Amazon Prime Video subscriptions with select plans.", "normalised": "One of the primary considerations is the data allowance itself.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial aspect is the validity period. Options range from short-term plans lasting a week or two, perfect for occasional travellers or users needing a temporary data boost, to monthly plans and annual plans. Annual plans, while requiring a larger upfront investment, often offer significant cost savings in the long run. For instance, an annual plan might cost Rs. 2500, effectively reducing the monthly cost compared to a Rs. 299 monthly recharge.", "normalised": "Another crucial aspect is the validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowance and validity, other features influence the value proposition. Many plans include unlimited voice calls, a significant advantage for those who still rely on traditional phone calls. Data rollover features, allowing unused data to be carried over to the next month, are also becoming increasingly common, especially beneficial for users with fluctuating data consumption patterns.", "normalised": "Beyond data allowance and validity, other features influence the value proposition.

{"unnormalised": "The speed of the data connection is also paramount. While 4G remains the dominant technology, the rollout of 5G is gradually transforming the landscape, promising significantly faster speeds and lower latency. However, 5G availability is still limited to select cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Check compatibility of your phone model with the 5G frequency bands used by different Telcos.", "normalised": "The speed of the data connection is also paramount.

{"unnormalised": "During festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, telecom providers often introduce special offers and discounts on data plans. So, whether you are enjoying a plate of delicious biryani or participating in the festivities, stay connected with a plan that suits your needs. Be mindful of the fine print, including any data caps or fair usage policies. Choosing the right data plan can significantly enhance your digital experience and provide excellent value for money. Some packages boast speeds \"up to 100 Mbps\" but that might degrade depending on network congestion in your area of Dwarka, for instance.", "normalised": "During festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, telecom providers often introduce special offers and discounts on data plans.
