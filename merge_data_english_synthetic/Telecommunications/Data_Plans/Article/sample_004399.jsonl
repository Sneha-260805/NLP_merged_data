{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are primarily categorized based on validity, data allowance, and bundled services. Validity periods typically range from a single day to a full year, catering to diverse user needs. For instance, someone streaming IPL matches on their phone might opt for a short-term plan with a high data allowance, whereas a student using data for online classes might prefer a longer-term, more economical option.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are primarily categorized based on validity, data allowance, and bundled services.

{"unnormalised": "Data allowance, naturally, dictates the amount of data available for use. This can be expressed in GBs (Gigabytes), often ranging from a few GBs to several hundred. Recently, telcos like Jio and Airtel have also introduced \"unlimited\" data plans, which, while technically capped, offer a significantly high data allowance before throttling speeds. Many of these plans also offer data rollover, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle, a feature particularly attractive to budget-conscious consumers in states like Bihar.", "normalised": "Data allowance, naturally, dictates the amount of data available for use.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual usage patterns. Someone who primarily uses their phone for messaging and social media can likely get by with a more basic plan, while a heavy user who streams videos, downloads large files, or plays online games will need a more robust offering.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual usage patterns.

{"unnormalised": "Before settling on a plan, it’s advisable to compare offerings from different providers, paying attention to hidden costs and terms and conditions. Features like data add-ons and data boosters should also be factored in, especially for unexpected surges in data consumption during festivals like Onam, when families often video call relatives abroad. Think about how much data you need for watching videos of Amma's cooking on YouTube while trying her delicious biryani recipe!", "normalised": "Before settling on a plan, it’s advisable to compare offerings from different providers, paying attention to hidden costs and terms and conditions.
