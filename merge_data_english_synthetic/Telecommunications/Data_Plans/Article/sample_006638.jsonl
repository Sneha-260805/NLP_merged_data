{"unnormalised": "The complexity arises from the sheer variety. We see entry-level plans offering a meager 1GB of data for Rs. 49, designed for users with minimal internet needs, perhaps just WhatsApp and the occasional Google search. On the other end of the spectrum, premium plans boast unlimited data (subject to fair usage policies) along with bundled subscriptions to OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, costing upwards of Rs. 799 per month.", "normalised": "The complexity arises from the sheer variety.

{"unnormalised": "One critical factor is the daily data limit. Many popular plans offer a specific amount of data per day, say 2GB per day. Exceeding this daily limit often results in a significant reduction in speed, rendering data unusable for bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming or video conferencing. Carefully assessing your daily data consumption is therefore vital.", "normalised": "One critical factor is the daily data limit.

{"unnormalised": "Another key consideration is the validity period, ranging from a few days to a full year. Choosing a plan with a validity period that aligns with your usage patterns can help avoid unnecessary recharges and associated costs. For instance, someone travelling from Delhi to Kochi for Onam might opt for a short-term plan offering ample data for video calls back home and navigating unfamiliar locations.", "normalised": "Another key consideration is the validity period, ranging from a few days to a full year.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, understanding the fine print related to \"fair usage policies\" is paramount. Even with \"unlimited\" data plans, operators often impose limitations on data speeds after a certain threshold is reached. For example, after consuming 100GB of data in a month, the speed might be throttled down to a frustrating 64kbps.", "normalised": "Furthermore, understanding the fine print related to \"fair usage policies\" is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic parameters, value-added services also play a role. Some plans offer additional benefits like free access to educational platforms, cloud storage, or even discounts at select retailers. These extras can significantly enhance the overall value proposition. Think free access to online learning platforms for students in smaller towns like Patna or Varanasi.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic parameters, value-added services also play a role.

{"unnormalised": "The relentless competition has led to innovative plan structures. Data top-ups, which offer additional data on an ad-hoc basis when the existing plan's allowance is exhausted, are commonly available. Many operators also offer data rollovers, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle, preventing wastage. These features are beneficial for those who occasionally exceed their regular data limits but don't want to commit to a higher-tier plan.", "normalised": "The relentless competition has led to innovative plan structures.
