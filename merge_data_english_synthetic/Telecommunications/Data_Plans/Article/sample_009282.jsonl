{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity, data allowance, and additional benefits. Validity ranges from daily plans (e.g., 1 GB/day for 28 days) to annual packs offering substantial data quotas for an extended period. Leading operators like Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and Jio offer a diverse array of options to cater to varied consumption patterns. One common strategy involves bundling data with unlimited voice calls to any network, reflecting the continued importance of voice communication despite the dominance of data-driven services.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity, data allowance, and additional benefits.

{"unnormalised": "The data allowance itself is a critical factor. Users must accurately estimate their monthly data needs based on activities like streaming videos on platforms like Hotstar or YouTube, using social media apps like WhatsApp and Facebook, browsing the internet, and online gaming (popular games like Ludo King consume significant data). Exceeding the allocated data often results in reduced speeds or additional charges, potentially derailing one's budget, especially during festive seasons like Diwali when online shopping surges.", "normalised": "The data allowance itself is a critical factor.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the core data and calling benefits, many plans offer value-added services. These may include access to premium content platforms like JioCinema or Airtel Xstream, cloud storage solutions, or even bundled subscriptions to services like Amazon Prime. Some operators also offer data rollover benefits, allowing unused data from one billing cycle to be carried forward to the next, reducing wastage.", "normalised": "Beyond the core data and calling benefits, many plans offer value-added services.

Customers can conveniently recharge their accounts online through operator websites and apps, third-party platforms like Paytm and PhonePe, or offline at local retailers. Mobile number portability (MNP) has further empowered consumers, enabling them to switch operators seamlessly while retaining their existing number if they find better data plan options elsewhere.", "normalised": "Recharge options are equally diverse.

He primarily uses his smartphone for WhatsApp video calls with his grandchildren and occasionally streams devotional songs. A plan offering 2GB of data per day might be overkill for him. A more suitable option would be a plan offering 1.5 GB/day with a longer validity, perhaps 84 days.", "normalised": "Consider Mister Sharma from Kanpur, a retired school teacher.

{"unnormalised": "Data consumption often spikes during special occasions. For instance, during Onam, families residing away from Kerala often rely heavily on video calls to connect with loved ones and participate in the festivities virtually. This increased usage necessitates a higher data allowance or a temporary data booster pack.", "normalised": "Data consumption often spikes during special occasions.
