{"unnormalised": "At a basic level, data plans are tiered subscription services offering a specific allowance of mobile data (typically measured in GB) for internet access on smartphones and other devices. Plans vary significantly based on several factors: data allowance, validity period (ranging from daily to yearly), speed (3G, 4G, 5G), bundled benefits (e.g., free calls, SMS, OTT platform subscriptions), and price.", "normalised": "At a basic level, data plans are tiered subscription services offering a specific allowance of mobile data (typically measured in gigabytes) for internet access on smartphones and other devices.

{"unnormalised": "Leading Indian telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer a bewildering array of plans catering to diverse user needs. A typical monthly plan might offer 2GB of data per day for Rs. 299, valid for 28 days, while a yearly plan could provide a total of 730GB of data at Rs. 2,999. It's important to scrutinize the fine print: are there any Fair Usage Policies (FUPs) in place, limiting speeds after a certain data consumption threshold? What happens to unused data at the end of the validity period – does it roll over, or is it forfeited?", "normalised": "Leading Indian telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I) offer a bewildering array of plans catering to diverse user needs.

{"unnormalised": "The advent of 5G technology is further complicating the landscape. While 5G promises blazing-fast speeds and lower latency, 5G data plans often come at a premium. Consumers should evaluate whether the added speed justifies the higher cost, especially considering the limited 5G coverage in many parts of the country. Dr. Sharma, a renowned telecom analyst at IIT Kanpur, emphasizes the importance of checking network coverage maps before subscribing to a 5G plan.", "normalised": "The advent of five G technology is further complicating the landscape.
