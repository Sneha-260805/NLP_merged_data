{"unnormalised": "The era of 2G saw limited data consumption, primarily used for basic email and browsing. The introduction of 3G in the late 2000s, spearheaded by companies like BSNL and Airtel, marked a turning point. These plans, often priced around Rs. 250 for 1 GB per month, opened the doors for mobile internet usage beyond simple text-based communication. The real revolution, however, came with the advent of 4G LTE networks, pioneered by Reliance Jio in 2016.", "normalised": "The era of two G saw limited data consumption, primarily used for basic email and browsing. The introduction of three G in the late two thousands, spearheaded by companies like B S N L and Airtel, marked a turning point.

The real revolution, however, came with the advent of four G L T E networks, pioneered by Reliance Jio in two thousand and sixteen."}
{"unnormalised": "Jio's disruptive entry into the market, offering incredibly cheap data plans and voice calls, triggered a price war among existing telecom operators, forcing them to drastically revise their offerings. Suddenly, data plans with 1 GB per day at around Rs. 399 for 84 days became the norm. This made mobile internet accessible to a much larger segment of the population, connecting millions of previously unconnected individuals. The impact on e-commerce, digital payments (like UPI), and online education was profound. Think about the countless students in places like IIT Madras or JNU using data plans for research and online classes at 14:00 hrs daily.", "normalised": "Jio's disruptive entry into the market, offering incredibly cheap data plans and voice calls, triggered a price war among existing telecom operators, forcing them to drastically revise their offerings.

{"unnormalised": "The future of data plans in India is inextricably linked to the rollout of 5G technology. While still in its nascent stages as of 2023, 5G promises significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater network capacity. This will unlock new possibilities for applications like augmented reality, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT). We can expect to see new data plans designed specifically to leverage the capabilities of 5G networks, potentially introducing tiered pricing based on bandwidth consumption and application priority. Consider the potential impact on telemedicine in remote villages on 15/08/2024, relying on low-latency 5G data plans.", "normalised": "The future of data plans in India is inextricably linked to the rollout of five G technology.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Bridging the digital divide, ensuring affordable access to data for all, and addressing concerns about data privacy and security are crucial priorities for the Indian telecommunications sector. The government's BharatNet project aims to connect all villages in India with high-speed internet by 31/12/2025, which will further amplify the demand for suitable and affordable data plans. Ultimately, the success of India's digital transformation hinges on the continued evolution and accessibility of data plans for all its citizens. The dream is to see even a chaiwala in Kolkata leveraging a cost-effective data plan to run his business efficiently.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
