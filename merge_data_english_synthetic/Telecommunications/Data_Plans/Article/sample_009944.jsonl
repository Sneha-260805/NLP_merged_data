As India continues its digital transformation journey, data plans will remain a crucial enabler, connecting individuals, businesses, and communities across the country. The launch of six G is anticipated around two thousand and thirty and will further drive the evolution of data plan offerings to accommodate the increased bandwidth demands. The need for localized data centers within India will also grow exponentially. At fourteen hundred hours on any given day, millions of transactions are carried out using these data plans."}
