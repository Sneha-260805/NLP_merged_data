{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India typically come in two broad categories: prepaid and postpaid. Prepaid plans, immensely popular due to their flexibility and ease of control, require users to recharge their accounts with a specific amount to access a predetermined data allowance for a certain validity period, often ranging from 28 days to 365 days. Major players like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer a plethora of prepaid plans catering to diverse consumption patterns, starting from basic plans with 1 GB of data per day to high-volume plans with 3 GB or more per day, sometimes bundled with unlimited calling and SMS benefits.", "normalised": "Data plans in India typically come in two broad categories: prepaid and postpaid.

{"unnormalised": "Postpaid plans, on the other hand, involve a monthly billing cycle, where users pay for their data usage at the end of the month, typically with a fixed data allowance included. These plans often come with additional perks like priority customer service, family plan options, and bundled OTT subscriptions. They are preferred by users who require consistent connectivity and predictable monthly expenses.", "normalised": "Postpaid plans, on the other hand, involve a monthly billing cycle, where users pay for their data usage at the end of the month, typically with a fixed data allowance included.

Factors to consider include the daily data consumption, the frequency of calls and SMS, and the required validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Competition among telecom operators has led to aggressive pricing and innovative data plans. Some operators offer \"data rollover\" benefits, allowing users to carry forward unused data from the previous month. Others provide \"data boosters\" that can be purchased to supplement existing data allowances when nearing exhaustion. Many plans now heavily emphasize bundled OTT platform subscriptions like Disney+ Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video, recognizing the increasing consumption of streaming content.", "normalised": "Competition among telecom operators has led to aggressive pricing and innovative data plans.

{"unnormalised": "Before selecting a plan, users should also carefully examine the fine print regarding data speeds. While operators advertise 4G and 5G capabilities, actual speeds can vary depending on network congestion, location, and device capabilities. Some plans may also impose Fair Usage Policy (FUP) limits, throttling data speeds after a certain threshold is reached. Consider also any roaming charges if you're planning to travel from Delhi to Kerala, for instance.
