{"unnormalised": "Data allowances typically range from daily limits (e.g., 1.5 GB per day) to bulk packages (e.g., 50 GB for the entire month). Validity periods can be as short as a day or as long as a year. The choice depends heavily on individual usage patterns. A student in Delhi streaming lectures and attending online classes will have different needs than a retired Dr. Sharma in Jaipur who primarily uses data for WhatsApp and the occasional video call with his grandchildren.", "normalised": "Data allowances typically range from daily limits (e.g., one point five gigabyte per day) to bulk packages (e.g., fifty gigabyte for the entire month).

{"unnormalised": "Speed is another crucial factor. 4G remains the dominant technology, but the rollout of 5G is rapidly changing the landscape, promising significantly faster download and upload speeds. A business professional in Mumbai transferring large files, for example, will benefit immensely from a 5G plan, whereas someone browsing social media in a smaller town might find 4G adequate. It's worth noting that actual speeds can vary depending on network congestion and location, even within a city like Bangalore, where signal strength can fluctuate considerably.", "normalised": "Speed is another crucial factor. four G remains the dominant technology, but the rollout of five G is rapidly changing the landscape, promising significantly faster download and upload speeds.

{"unnormalised": "Bundled services are often included in data plans to enhance their value. These can include unlimited voice calls, SMS messages, access to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like JioCinema or Airtel Xstream, and even free subscriptions to music streaming services. Some plans also offer roaming benefits, allowing users to use their data allowance while traveling within India, although international roaming typically requires separate add-on packs.", "normalised": "Bundled services are often included in data plans to enhance their value.

{"unnormalised": "The price of data plans in India is fiercely competitive. Entry-level plans offering limited data and validity can cost as little as Rs. 149, while premium plans with larger data allowances, longer validity, and bundled services can cost upwards of Rs. 2,500 per year. There are also data add-on packs that allow users to top up their data allowance if they run out before the validity period expires. For example, a farmer in Punjab using data to access agricultural information and market prices might opt for a small data add-on pack mid-month.", "normalised": "The price of data plans in India is fiercely competitive.

{"unnormalised": "Recent trends in the Indian telecommunications market include the increasing adoption of unlimited data plans (with fair usage policies) and the growing popularity of data vouchers that offer short-term data boosts. The government's initiatives to improve rural connectivity are also playing a significant role in expanding access to affordable data plans in underserved areas. This includes building infrastructure in areas where housing density is low, sometimes less than 5 homes per sq km.", "normalised": "Recent trends in the Indian telecommunications market include the increasing adoption of unlimited data plans (with fair usage policies) and the growing popularity of data vouchers that offer short-term data boosts.
