{"unnormalised": "In essence, a data plan is a prepaid or postpaid agreement with a telecom operator that grants a subscriber a specific allowance of data usage over a defined period. These plans can range from basic offerings providing a few GBs of data to high-volume packages with unlimited calls and access to streaming services. Operators such as Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are constantly innovating and revising their plans to cater to diverse customer needs. Factors influencing plan design include data volume, validity period (e.g., 28 days, 84 days, 365 days), calling benefits (local, STD, roaming), and bundled subscriptions to OTT platforms like Hotstar or Zee5.", "normalised": "In essence, a data plan is a prepaid or postpaid agreement with a telecom operator that grants a subscriber a specific allowance of data usage over a defined period.

{"unnormalised": "The competitive landscape necessitates frequent revisions and promotional offers. For instance, Jio launched its initial data plans on 05/09/2016, sparking a price war that benefited consumers immensely. We saw data prices plummet from an average of Rs. 250/GB to under Rs. 10/GB within a short span. Even today, operators introduce special recharge offers during festivals like Diwali and Holi. Vi, for example, often launches additional data offers around 15/08 (Independence Day).", "normalised": "The competitive landscape necessitates frequent revisions and promotional offers.

Students in Kota preparing for IIT-JEE exams are now able to access online coaching material from anywhere, thanks to readily available data connectivity. Small businesses in Chennai can connect with customers across the globe through social media and online marketplaces. Moreover, the government's Digital India initiative relies heavily on the accessibility of affordable data plans to bridge the digital divide.", "normalised": "The rise of data plans has also enabled the growth of e-commerce, online education, and digital entertainment in India.

Network congestion during peak hours (e.g., 18:00 hrs - 22:00 hrs) in densely populated areas like Kolkata can lead to slower speeds and a frustrating user experience. Digital literacy also poses a barrier for some segments of the population, particularly in rural areas. While data plans are getting cheaper, affordability remains a concern for low-income households. Regulatory bodies like TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) play a crucial role in ensuring fair competition, protecting consumer interests, and promoting innovation in the data plan market. The ongoing 5G rollout is expected to further enhance data speeds and capacity, opening up new possibilities for applications in areas like telemedicine, smart agriculture, and autonomous vehicles. The future of telecommunications in India is inextricably linked to the evolution and accessibility of data plans.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
