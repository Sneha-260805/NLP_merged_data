{"unnormalised": "Data plans are packages that provide subscribers with a pre-determined amount of data (usually measured in GB) for internet access over a specified period (typically 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, or a year). The cost of these plans varies widely depending on the data allowance, validity period, and bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls and SMS. For example, a basic plan offering 1 GB of data per day for 28 days might cost around Rs. 249, while a premium plan with 3 GB per day for 84 days could be priced at Rs. 699.", "normalised": "Data plans are packages that provide subscribers with a pre-determined amount of data (usually measured in G B) for internet access over a specified period (typically twenty eight days, fifty six days, eighty four days, or a year). The cost of these plans varies widely depending on the data allowance, validity period, and bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls and S-M-S. For example, a basic plan offering one G B of data per day for twenty eight days might cost around rupee two hundred and forty nine, while a premium plan with three G B per day for eighty four days could be priced at rupee six hundred and ninety nine."}
{"unnormalised": "Competition amongst telecom operators has led to a race to offer increasingly attractive data plans. This benefits consumers, enabling them to access online services like streaming video on platforms like Hotstar, conducting online transactions, and staying connected with family and friends via WhatsApp and other messaging apps. Students, especially those attending institutions like IIT Delhi or IIM Ahmedabad, rely heavily on data plans for their academic pursuits.", "normalised": "Competition amongst telecom operators has led to a race to offer increasingly attractive data plans.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing data consumption remains a key concern for many subscribers. Exceeding the allotted data limit can lead to significant charges, often calculated at a rate of Rs. 0.50 per MB or higher. To mitigate this, telecom companies provide tools and apps that allow users to track their data usage in real-time. These apps also offer the option to purchase data top-ups or upgrade to a higher-tier plan.", "normalised": "However, managing data consumption remains a key concern for many subscribers.

{"unnormalised": "According to Dr. Sharma at the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the average data consumption per user in India has been steadily increasing year-on-year. This underlines the importance of robust network infrastructure and continued innovation in data plan offerings to meet the growing demand. The area covered by telecom towers in Mumbai, for instance, is estimated to be over 400 sq km, reflecting the significant investment in infrastructure required to support the burgeoning data demand.", "normalised": "According to Doctor Sharma at the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (T-R-A-I), the average data consumption per user in India has been steadily increasing year-on-year.
