{"unnormalised": "In the vibrant and rapidly evolving landscape of Indian telecommunications, data plans have become indispensable. From bustling metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Delhi to the serene backwaters of Kerala, affordable and reliable data access is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. The rise of Jio in 2016 revolutionized the market, ushering in an era of ultra-cheap data, forcing incumbents like Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) to drastically revise their offerings.", "normalised": "In the vibrant and rapidly evolving landscape of Indian telecommunications, data plans have become indispensable.

{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (e.g., 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, 365 days), data allowance (measured in GB per day or a lump sum), and included benefits such as unlimited voice calls and SMS. Many plans now also bundle access to OTT platforms like Zee5 and Disney+ Hotstar, catering to the entertainment needs of the largely mobile-first Indian audience. Dr. Sharma, a leading telecom analyst at IIM Ahmedabad, observes, \"The bundling strategy is a key differentiator, allowing telcos to retain customers and increase ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).\"", "normalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (e.g., twenty eight days, fifty six days, eighty four days, three hundred and sixty five days), data allowance (measured in gigabyte per day or a lump sum), and included benefits such as unlimited voice calls and S M S.

{"unnormalised": "The penetration of 4G networks across the country has been a significant driver of data consumption. Rural India, once lagging behind, is now experiencing a surge in data usage, fueled by initiatives like BharatNet which aims to connect villages with high-speed internet. This increased connectivity has empowered farmers in Punjab, artisans in Rajasthan, and small business owners in Tamil Nadu to access information, markets, and opportunities previously unavailable.", "normalised": "The penetration of four G networks across the country has been a significant driver of data consumption.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Data tariffs, while significantly lower than in many other countries, are still a barrier for some segments of the population. Furthermore, network congestion, particularly during peak hours, can lead to a degraded user experience. The quality of service needs to be consistently improved, especially in densely populated areas like Dharavi, where millions access the internet within a relatively small area of approximately 2.1 sq km.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
