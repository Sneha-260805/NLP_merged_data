Before four G technology became widespread, data usage was limited and expensive. However, the aggressive pricing strategies adopted by Jio, starting around two thousand and sixteen, triggered a data revolution. Suddenly, large swathes of the population, including those in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, could affordably access high-speed internet. This led to a surge in online activities, from streaming Bollywood movies to conducting financial transactions via U P I."}

Plans with twenty eight day validity are common, aligning with monthly billing cycles. However, longer validity plans, stretching to fifty six days, eighty four days, or even three hundred and sixty five days, offer convenience to users who prefer to avoid frequent recharges. For instance, a yearly plan typically becomes active from fifteenth august two thousand and twenty three and last until fourteenth august two thousand and twenty four."}
