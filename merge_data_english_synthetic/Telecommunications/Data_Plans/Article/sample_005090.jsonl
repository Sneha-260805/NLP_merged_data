{"unnormalised": "Data plans are a fundamental aspect of modern telecommunications, especially in a rapidly digitizing nation like India. They represent the contractual agreement between a mobile network operator (MNO) and a subscriber, outlining the terms under which the subscriber can access mobile internet services. These plans typically define the volume of data available (measured in GB or TB), the validity period (e.g., 28 days, 84 days, 365 days), and any associated benefits such as unlimited voice calls or access to specific content platforms.", "normalised": "Data plans are a fundamental aspect of modern telecommunications, especially in a rapidly digitizing nation like India.

{"unnormalised": "The evolution of data plans in India has been dramatic, spurred by the entrance of Reliance Jio in September 2016. Prior to this, data costs were prohibitively high for many, often exceeding Rs. 250/GB. Jio's disruptive pricing model, offering significantly cheaper data and bundled voice calls, forced existing players like Airtel and Vodafone Idea (now Vi) to drastically revise their own offerings. This ushered in an era of intense competition, benefiting consumers with more affordable and generous data plans.", "normalised": "The evolution of data plans in India has been dramatic, spurred by the entrance of Reliance Jio in September two thousand and sixteen.

{"unnormalised": "Current data plans in India vary widely depending on the MNO and the specific needs of the subscriber. Entry-level plans may offer 1 GB of data per day for Rs. 199 with a validity of 28 days. Mid-range plans, popular amongst users in tier-2 cities like Lucknow and Jaipur, might provide 2 GB of data per day for Rs. 499 with an 84-day validity. Premium plans, catering to heavy data users, could offer unlimited data (with fair usage policy limits) or large data allowances (e.g., 100 GB) for Rs. 999 with a 365-day validity.", "normalised": "Current data plans in India vary widely depending on the M N O and the specific needs of the subscriber. Entry-level plans may offer one gigabyte of data per day for rupee one hundred and ninety nine with a validity of twenty eight days.

Premium plans, catering to heavy data users, could offer unlimited data (with fair usage policy limits) or large data allowances (for example, one hundred gigabyte) for rupee nine hundred and ninety nine with a three hundred and sixty five day validity."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the data allowance and validity, several other factors influence the value proposition of a data plan. These include network coverage (critical in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), download and upload speeds, and access to value-added services such as streaming platforms (e.g., JioCinema, Airtel Xstream), caller tunes, or cloud storage. The introduction of 5G services is expected to further refine data plan offerings, with higher speeds and lower latency potentially enabling new use cases and demanding different pricing strategies. Analysts predict a significant shift in plan structures by 01/01/2025 as 5G adoption increases.", "normalised": "Beyond the data allowance and validity, several other factors influence the value proposition of a data plan.

{"unnormalised": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a crucial role in regulating the telecommunications sector, including ensuring transparency and fairness in data plan offerings. TRAI regulations aim to protect consumer interests and promote healthy competition among MNOs. For example, regulations related to data rollover policies and clear communication of fair usage policies are aimed at preventing consumer exploitation. There was a significant TRAI meeting on the issue of data privacy held at 11:00 hrs on 15/08/2023.", "normalised": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (T R A I) plays a crucial role in regulating the telecommunications sector, including ensuring transparency and fairness in data plan offerings.

{"unnormalised": "The future of data plans in India will likely be shaped by several factors, including the continued expansion of 5G networks, the increasing demand for data-intensive applications (e.g., video streaming, online gaming), and the evolving regulatory landscape. The ongoing BharatNet project, aiming to connect all villages with high-speed internet, will also play a crucial role in expanding data access and influencing the types of data plans offered in rural areas. This is a vital step towards realizing Digital India by 2047. Data consumption is predicted to triple by 2030, requiring further innovation in plan structures and network infrastructure.", "normalised": "The future of data plans in India will likely be shaped by several factors, including the continued expansion of five G networks, the increasing demand for data-intensive applications (for example, video streaming, online gaming), and the evolving regulatory landscape.
