{"unnormalised": "Indian telecom companies, including Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), offer a wide range of data plans tailored to diverse consumer needs. These plans typically vary based on data allowance, validity period, and associated bundled services like voice calls and SMS. The competitive landscape has driven prices down significantly in recent years, making India one of the cheapest markets globally in terms of data cost per GB. For example, one can often find plans offering 1.5 GB of daily data for Rs. 249 with a validity of 28 days.", "normalised": "Indian telecom companies, including Reliance J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I), offer a wide range of data plans tailored to diverse consumer needs.

{"unnormalised": "The factors influencing the design and pricing of data plans are multifaceted. Firstly, spectrum availability and infrastructure investments play a crucial role. Companies like Bharti Airtel have been actively investing in expanding their 4G network coverage across the country, including rural areas in states like Rajasthan. The introduction of 5G technology is expected to further revolutionize data consumption patterns and necessitate new, higher-bandwidth data plans. This roll-out, however, presents challenges regarding infrastructure upgrades and ensuring equitable access across the country.", "normalised": "The factors influencing the design and pricing of data plans are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Consumer behavior also significantly impacts data plan strategy. With the increasing popularity of streaming services like Hotstar and Netflix, and the pervasive use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram, data consumption is on the rise. Young professionals, college students at institutions like IIT Delhi, and even small business owners in towns like Jaipur rely heavily on mobile data for communication, entertainment, and business operations. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad, notes that \"the adoption of digital payment platforms like Paytm has further fuelled the demand for seamless data connectivity.\"", "normalised": "Consumer behavior also significantly impacts data plan strategy.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Network congestion, particularly in densely populated urban areas, can impact data speeds and user experience. Additionally, data plans with restrictive fair usage policies (FUP) can limit the user experience for heavy data consumers. Moreover, bridging the digital divide requires not just affordable data, but also digital literacy and access to appropriate devices, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized communities. Ensuring sustainable growth and addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued evolution of data plans in the Indian telecommunications landscape. The average speed in a place like Chennai is about 25 Mbps as of Oct 26, 2023.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
