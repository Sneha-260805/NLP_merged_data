{"unnormalised": "Data plans are essentially packages offered by telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), providing a pre-defined amount of internet data, often bundled with voice calling and SMS benefits, for a fixed period. These plans vary significantly in terms of data allowance (measured in GBs), validity (ranging from a few days to a year), and price (starting from as low as Rs. 49 for a basic plan to upwards of Rs. 2999 for annual options).", "normalised": "Data plans are essentially packages offered by telecom operators like Reliance J-i-o, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V-i), providing a pre-defined amount of internet data, often bundled with voice calling and S-M-S benefits, for a fixed period.

{"unnormalised": "The most common types of data plans include daily data plans (offering a fixed amount of data per day, usually 1 GB to 3 GB), monthly plans (providing a lump sum of data for the entire month), and long-term plans (valid for several months or a year). Many operators also offer add-on data packs to supplement existing plans when data limits are exhausted, preventing interruptions in service.", "normalised": "The most common types of data plans include daily data plans (offering a fixed amount of data per day, usually one G-B to three G-B), monthly plans (providing a lump sum of data for the entire month), and long-term plans (valid for several months or a year).

{"unnormalised": "Consumers need to consider their individual usage patterns when selecting a data plan. For example, a student relying on online lectures and video streaming might benefit from a daily data plan with a generous allowance, while a professional primarily using data for email and social media might find a monthly plan with a smaller data cap sufficient. Considerations like network coverage in their area (especially important in tier-2 and tier-3 cities) and the quality of customer service offered by the operator are also vital.", "normalised": "Consumers need to consider their individual usage patterns when selecting a data plan.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the prevalence of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotstar has further fueled the demand for high-bandwidth data plans. Many operators now offer bundled plans that include subscriptions to these platforms, providing added value to consumers. This is particularly appealing during festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, when families spend more time watching movies and shows together. Imagine enjoying a plate of delicious biryani while streaming your favorite Onam-themed movie - all powered by a reliable data plan.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the prevalence of Over-the-Top (O-T-T) platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotstar has further fueled the demand for high-bandwidth data plans.

The introduction of 5G technology promises significantly faster data speeds and lower latency, but its widespread deployment is still underway. Moreover, concerns regarding data privacy and security remain paramount, requiring operators to prioritize robust security measures and adhere to strict data protection regulations set by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India).", "normalised": "However, the industry is not without its challenges.
