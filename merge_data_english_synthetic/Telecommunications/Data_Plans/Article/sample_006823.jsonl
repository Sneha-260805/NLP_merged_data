{"unnormalised": "A data plan, in its simplest form, provides a specified allowance of data usage over a defined period, typically 28 days, 56 days, or 84 days. Major telecom operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer a diverse range of plans catering to different user profiles. These plans often bundle data with voice calling (local, STD, and roaming) and SMS benefits, creating a comprehensive communication package.", "normalised": "A data plan, in its simplest form, provides a specified allowance of data usage over a defined period, typically twenty eight days, fifty six days, or eighty four days.

These plans often bundle data with voice calling (local, S T D, and roaming) and S M S benefits, creating a comprehensive communication package."}
{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of one's individual usage patterns. For example, someone who primarily uses data for social media and messaging might opt for a plan with 1 GB to 2 GB of data per day. However, a professional who frequently attends video conferences or streams high-definition content may require a plan offering 3 GB or more per day.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of one's individual usage patterns. For example, someone who primarily uses data for social media and messaging might opt for a plan with one G B to two G B of data per day. However, a professional who frequently attends video conferences or streams high-definition content may require a plan offering three G B or more per day."}
{"unnormalised": "Data plans are generally categorized based on several factors: the total data allowance (e.g., 50 GB, 100 GB), the daily data limit (e.g., 1.5 GB/day, 2 GB/day), the validity period (e.g., 28 days, 84 days), and the additional benefits included (e.g., access to streaming services like Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video). Operators also offer specialized plans catering to specific needs, such as data add-on packs for users who exhaust their data allowance before the plan's expiry.", "normalised": "Data plans are generally categorized based on several factors: the total data allowance (e.g., fifty G B, one hundred G B), the daily data limit (e.g., one point five G B per day, two G B per day), the validity period (e.g., twenty eight days, eighty four days), and the additional benefits included (e.g., access to streaming services like Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video). Operators also offer specialized plans catering to specific needs, such as data add-on packs for users who exhaust their data allowance before the plan's expiry."}
{"unnormalised": "The pricing of data plans varies significantly across different operators and regions. Factors influencing pricing include network infrastructure costs, competition, and regulatory policies. For instance, a 1.5 GB/day plan with unlimited calling and 100 SMS/day for 28 days might cost anywhere between Rs. 249 to Rs. 299. Some plans even offer data rollover features, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle.", "normalised": "The pricing of data plans varies significantly across different operators and regions. Factors influencing pricing include network infrastructure costs, competition, and regulatory policies. For instance, a one point five G B per day plan with unlimited calling and one hundred S M S per day for twenty eight days might cost anywhere between rupee two hundred and forty nine to rupee two hundred and ninety nine. Some plans even offer data rollover features, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the quality of service, specifically the data speed, is a critical aspect to consider. 4G connectivity is now widespread, but 5G deployment is rapidly expanding, promising significantly faster data speeds. A resident of, say, a 1200 sq ft apartment in Andheri might experience varying speeds depending on the network coverage in their area. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Bombay, highlighted the importance of consistent data speeds for online learning and research.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the quality of service, specifically the data speed, is a critical aspect to consider.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian telecommunications landscape is expected to witness continued innovation in data plan offerings. Operators are likely to introduce more personalized plans based on usage patterns, incorporating technologies like AI to optimize data consumption and offer customized recommendations. The increasing adoption of IoT devices and smart home technology will also drive the demand for specialized data plans tailored to these applications. Access to affordable and reliable data remains crucial for bridging the digital divide and empowering communities across India, from the bustling streets of Kolkata to the serene landscapes of Kerala. The future of Indian telecom rests heavily on accessible and relevant data solutions.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the Indian telecommunications landscape is expected to witness continued innovation in data plan offerings.
