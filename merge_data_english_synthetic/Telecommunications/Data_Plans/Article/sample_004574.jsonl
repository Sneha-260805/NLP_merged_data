Dr. Sharma, a prominent telecom analyst at IIT Kanpur, notes that the evolution of data plans in India has been remarkable. From the initial days of expensive per-MB charges, we've witnessed a dramatic decrease in price and an increase in data volumes. Jio's entry, for example, revolutionized the market, pushing other providers like Airtel and Vodafone Idea to offer more competitive plans.", "normalised": "A data plan, in essence, provides a specified allowance of data (measured in M B s, G B s, and now even T B s) for internet access over a cellular network for a defined period, usually twenty eight days, fifty six days, or eighty four days.
