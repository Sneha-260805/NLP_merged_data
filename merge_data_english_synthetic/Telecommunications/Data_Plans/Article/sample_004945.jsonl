Issues like network congestion during peak hours and the need for robust infrastructure in underserved regions need to be addressed to truly unlock the potential of data-driven growth in India. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a vital role in regulating the sector and ensuring fair competition among operators, benefiting the Indian consumer in the long run. Data consumption per capita in India stands at impressive levels, estimated to be around 18 GB per month, demonstrating the nation's growing appetite for digital connectivity.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
