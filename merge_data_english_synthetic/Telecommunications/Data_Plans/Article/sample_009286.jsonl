Suddenly, streaming videos, downloading large files, and engaging in video calls became commonplace. Current data plans are largely geared towards four G usage, with talk of five G spurring further advancements. Many plans now offer 'unlimited' data, although these often come with Fair Usage Policies (F U P s) that reduce speeds after a certain threshold is reached. For example, a plan might offer two G B of high-speed data per day, after which the speed drops to a significantly slower speed (e.g., sixty four K bps)."}

Users are highly price-sensitive, and even a small difference in price can significantly impact subscriber acquisition and retention. Plans often come with enticing offers, such as bundled subscriptions to streaming services like Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video, which further enhance their appeal. Recently, there's been a trend of \"data add-ons,\" allowing users to purchase extra data if they exhaust their daily or monthly allowance before the validity period ends. These add-ons can range from rupees twenty five for one G B to rupees ninety nine for five G B."}
