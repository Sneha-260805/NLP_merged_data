These plans, offered by various telecommunications service providers like Airtel, Jio, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and BSNL, dictate the amount of data a user can consume within a specified period, typically 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, or even annually. The price of these plans varies drastically depending on the data allowance, validity period, and additional benefits.", "normalised": "Data plans form the backbone of mobile communication and internet access in India, a country with a rapidly growing digital economy.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding the nuances of data plans is crucial for Indian consumers. Early adopters often opted for plans offering just a few GB of data for around Rs. 199 per month. Today, competition has driven prices down and data allowances up. Users in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi often consume upwards of 20 GB of data monthly, primarily for streaming videos, social media, and online gaming. In rural areas, where connectivity can be challenging, consumers may opt for smaller data packs with longer validity.", "normalised": "Understanding the nuances of data plans is crucial for Indian consumers. Early adopters often opted for plans offering just a few gigabytes of data for around rupee one hundred and ninety nine per month. Today, competition has driven prices down and data allowances up. Users in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi often consume upwards of twenty gigabytes of data monthly, primarily for streaming videos, social media, and online gaming. In rural areas, where connectivity can be challenging, consumers may opt for smaller data packs with longer validity."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowance, many plans offer bundled benefits. Unlimited voice calling is now standard, along with a certain number of SMS messages per day. Several plans also include access to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, or Zee5, making them attractive to entertainment-hungry users. Some plans even offer data rollover facilities, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next cycle, a particularly useful feature during festivals like Diwali, when families often travel and internet usage fluctuates.", "normalised": "Beyond data allowance, many plans offer bundled benefits.
