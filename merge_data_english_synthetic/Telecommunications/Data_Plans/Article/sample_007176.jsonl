{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity, data allowance, speed, and bundled services. Prepaid plans, immensely popular due to their flexibility, offer a fixed data quota for a defined period, ranging from a single day to a full year. For instance, Reliance Jio might offer a plan with 2 GB of daily data for 28 days at Rs. 299, while Airtel could provide a similar offering at Rs. 319. Postpaid plans, on the other hand, offer a monthly data allowance with the possibility of exceeding the limit, albeit at an additional cost per GB.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity, data allowance, speed, and bundled services.

{"unnormalised": "The speed offered by a data plan is a critical factor. 4G LTE remains the dominant technology, although 5G is rapidly expanding across major urban centers like Delhi and Bengaluru. Theoretical speeds are often advertised, but actual speeds experienced by users vary depending on network congestion, device capabilities, and location. A plan promising 100 Mbps download speed might only deliver 20-30 Mbps during peak hours in a densely populated area.", "normalised": "The speed offered by a data plan is a critical factor. four G L T E remains the dominant technology, although five G is rapidly expanding across major urban centers like Delhi and Bengaluru. Theoretical speeds are often advertised, but actual speeds experienced by users vary depending on network congestion, device capabilities, and location. A plan promising one hundred Megabits per second download speed might only deliver twenty to thirty Megabits per second during peak hours in a densely populated area."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond basic data allowance, many telecom operators bundle additional services into their data plans. These can include unlimited voice calls (STD and local), SMS benefits, access to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like JioCinema or Airtel Xstream, and even international roaming benefits. These bundled services can add significant value, particularly for users who frequently consume digital content or travel abroad.", "normalised": "Beyond basic data allowance, many telecom operators bundle additional services into their data plans.

{"unnormalised": "Data consumption habits are deeply influenced by cultural practices and traditions. During festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, data usage spikes dramatically as people connect with family and friends through video calls, share photos, and stream music. Preparing elaborate meals like biryani often involves watching online tutorials, further driving data consumption.", "normalised": "Data consumption habits are deeply influenced by cultural practices and traditions.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the emergence of work-from-home culture has placed increased demands on data plans. Households now require robust internet connectivity to support multiple devices simultaneously, leading to a greater preference for high-speed plans with larger data allowances. Institutions like IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad are increasingly reliant on stable internet access for online classes and research activities.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the emergence of work-from-home culture has placed increased demands on data plans.

{"unnormalised": "Consumers should carefully evaluate their data consumption patterns and prioritize plans that align with their specific needs. Comparing plans across different operators and considering factors such as speed, validity, and bundled services is essential for making the optimal choice in the ever-evolving Indian telecommunications landscape. Ignoring the fine print and opting for the cheapest plan without understanding its limitations can often lead to a less-than-satisfactory experience and unexpected charges.", "normalised": "Consumers should carefully evaluate their data consumption patterns and prioritize plans that align with their specific needs.
