{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically offered by major telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi). These plans come in various shapes and sizes, catering to diverse needs and budgets. One can generally categorize them as prepaid or postpaid.

{"unnormalised": "A key consideration when selecting a data plan is the data allowance (measured in GB or GB/day). Consumers need to assess their monthly data consumption based on their browsing habits, social media usage, streaming preferences (YouTube, Hotstar), and online gaming activities. For example, a student in Delhi relying heavily on online classes might require a plan with at least 2 GB/day, while a senior citizen primarily using WhatsApp to connect with family might suffice with a smaller data pack.", "normalised": "a key consideration when selecting a data plan is the data allowance (measured in G B or G B per day). consumers need to assess their monthly data consumption based on their browsing habits, social media usage, streaming preferences (youtube, hotstar), and online gaming activities. for example, a student in delhi relying heavily on online classes might require a plan with at least two G B per day, while a senior citizen primarily using whatsapp to connect with family might suffice with a smaller data pack."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowance, other factors to consider include the network speed (4G, 5G), validity period, bundled benefits, and roaming charges. 5G is slowly being rolled out across major Indian cities, promising significantly faster speeds compared to 4G.
