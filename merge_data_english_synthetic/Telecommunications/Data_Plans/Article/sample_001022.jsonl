{"unnormalised": "Data limits are a key consideration. Exceeding the allocated data often results in significantly slower speeds (throttling) or extra charges per MB consumed. Many operators now offer \"data sachet\" top-ups, allowing users to purchase additional data when their primary allowance is exhausted. These sachets, priced around Rs. 25-Rs. 50, provide temporary relief until the validity of the original plan renews.", "normalised": "Data limits are a key consideration.

JioFiber, for instance, offers integrated plans that combine broadband internet, mobile data, and access to JioTV channels. The concept of \"unlimited\" data plans is also evolving. While these plans may not have a strict data limit, they often impose fair usage policies (FUP) that throttle speeds after a certain amount of data consumption (e.g., 100 GB).", "normalised": "Emerging trends include data plans bundled with home internet services, creating a more comprehensive connectivity solution for households.
