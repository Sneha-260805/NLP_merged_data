{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India vary widely based on several factors, including data allowance (measured in GB), validity period (ranging from daily to annual), calling minutes, SMS benefits, and additional perks like bundled subscriptions to OTT platforms. Major players like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) constantly strive to attract customers with competitive offerings, often launching special festive season plans around Diwali or Onam.", "normalised": "Data plans in India vary widely based on several factors, including data allowance (measured in gigabytes), validity period (ranging from daily to annual), calling minutes, S M S benefits, and additional perks like bundled subscriptions to O T T platforms.

{"unnormalised": "The sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. Consider, for example, a plan offering 2 GB of data per day for 28 days with unlimited calling, priced at Rs. 299. Compare this to a long-term plan providing 84 GB of total data for 84 days at Rs. 599. The choice depends heavily on individual usage patterns. Someone who frequently streams content or relies heavily on mobile data for work may prefer the daily data plan. Conversely, a user with sporadic internet needs might find the bundled data plan more economical.", "normalised": "The sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. Consider, for example, a plan offering two gigabytes of data per day for twenty eight days with unlimited calling, priced at rupees two hundred and ninety nine. Compare this to a long-term plan providing eighty four gigabytes of total data for eighty four days at rupees five hundred and ninety nine. The choice depends heavily on individual usage patterns. Someone who frequently streams content or relies heavily on mobile data for work may prefer the daily data plan. Conversely, a user with sporadic internet needs might find the bundled data plan more economical."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, understanding Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is critical. Almost all “unlimited” plans come with an FUP, meaning that data speeds are throttled once the daily or total data limit is reached. Speeds typically drop to a paltry 64 kbps or 128 kbps, making even basic browsing a frustrating experience.", "normalised": "Furthermore, understanding Fair Usage Policy (F U P) is critical.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of 5G in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore is further influencing data plan structures. 5G-enabled plans often come with significantly higher data allowances and faster speeds, catering to users who want to leverage the full potential of the new technology. However, 5G coverage remains limited, and 4G plans are still the dominant option for most of the country.", "normalised": "The rise of five G in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore is further influencing data plan structures.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond purely transactional considerations, data plans have significant socio-economic implications in India. Affordable data allows students in remote villages like those near Kanyakumari to access online education, facilitates agricultural information dissemination to farmers in Punjab, and connects families separated by vast distances. Imagine sharing photos of a delicious plate of biryani during Eid celebrations with relatives across the country – all powered by reliable data connectivity.", "normalised": "Beyond purely transactional considerations, data plans have significant socio-economic implications in India.
