{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are generally categorized based on validity (daily, monthly, annual), data allowance (1 GB, 2 GB, unlimited), and bundled services (voice calls, SMS, access to OTT platforms). Daily data plans are popular for users with limited data requirements, typically offering 1 GB to 3 GB per day for a validity period of 28 days or 56 days. These plans often come with unlimited voice calls to any network and 100 SMS per day. Monthly plans, usually valid for 30 days, offer larger data allowances ranging from 50 GB to unlimited data, suitable for heavier data users in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Annual plans, valid for 365 days, provide the most significant data benefits and are ideal for users seeking long-term value. For instance, an Airtel annual plan might offer 2 GB of data per day, unlimited calls, and access to Airtel Xstream Premium for Rs. 2999.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are generally categorized based on validity (daily, monthly, annual), data allowance (one G B, two G B, unlimited), and bundled services (voice calls, S M S, access to O T T platforms). Daily data plans are popular for users with limited data requirements, typically offering one G B to three G B per day for a validity period of twenty eight days or fifty six days. These plans often come with unlimited voice calls to any network and one hundred S M S per day. Monthly plans, usually valid for thirty days, offer larger data allowances ranging from fifty G B to unlimited data, suitable for heavier data users in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Annual plans, valid for three hundred and sixty five days, provide the most significant data benefits and are ideal for users seeking long-term value. For instance, an Airtel annual plan might offer two G B of data per day, unlimited calls, and access to Airtel Xstream Premium for rupee two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several factors differentiate data plans. Data rollover, where unused data from one day or month is carried over to the next, is a sought-after feature. Some plans offer data add-ons, allowing users to purchase additional data when they exhaust their primary allocation. Others provide data rewards for specific activities like using certain apps or making online payments. Moreover, speed limitations often apply after the daily data limit is reached, typically reducing the speed to 64 kbps or 128 kbps.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several factors differentiate data plans.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of 5G technology is further transforming the data plan ecosystem. Operators are introducing 5G-specific plans that offer significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling users to experience enhanced streaming, gaming, and other data-intensive applications. These plans often come with premium pricing and are targeted towards users in areas with 5G coverage.", "normalised": "The rise of five G technology is further transforming the data plan ecosystem.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual needs and usage patterns. Factors like data consumption, calling habits, budget constraints, and network coverage should be evaluated. For example, a student residing in a PG accommodation of 200 sq ft in Chennai and relying primarily on Wi-Fi might opt for a low-cost daily data plan, while a working professional in Bangalore who frequently uses mobile data for video conferencing and downloading large files might need a high-data monthly or annual plan. Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi emphasizes the importance of understanding the fine print of each plan, including any hidden charges or limitations. Finally, it is prudent to compare plans across different operators to find the best value proposition.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual needs and usage patterns.
