After exceeding the FUP, speeds can drop dramatically, rendering streaming or downloading large files a frustrating experience. Therefore, it’s crucial to analyze your data consumption patterns before committing to a particular plan. Are you a heavy video streamer who needs 3 GB/day, or do you primarily use data for WhatsApp and occasional social media browsing, making 1 GB/day sufficient?", "normalised": "However, the devil is often in the details.
