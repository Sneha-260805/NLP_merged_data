{"unnormalised": "Data plans, in their essence, are pre-defined packages offered by telecom service providers like Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea, that bundle a specific amount of data (measured in GB or TB) with varying validity periods. These plans often include other benefits such as unlimited voice calls (local and STD), SMS, and access to over-the-top (OTT) content like streaming services and music apps.", "normalised": "Data plans, in their essence, are pre-defined packages offered by telecom service providers like Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea, that bundle a specific amount of data (measured in gigabyte or terabyte) with varying validity periods.

{"unnormalised": "The shift from 2G to 3G and now 4G LTE, and soon 5G, has been instrumental in shaping the data plan landscape. The introduction of Reliance Jio in September 2016 (09/2016) marked a watershed moment, triggering a price war and forcing other operators to drastically reduce data prices to remain competitive. This resulted in a significant increase in data consumption per user, with Indians now being among the largest consumers of mobile data globally.", "normalised": "The shift from two G to three G and now four G L T E, and soon five G, has been instrumental in shaping the data plan landscape.

{"unnormalised": "Today's data plans are highly segmented, catering to diverse user needs and budgets. Entry-level plans might offer 1 GB of data per day for a validity of 28 days, while premium plans can offer significantly larger data allowances, sometimes even unlimited data, for longer durations like 84 days or even 365 days (annual plans). Some plans are specifically tailored for social media usage, offering additional data for accessing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Others focus on streaming services, providing bundled subscriptions to popular OTT platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.", "normalised": "Today's data plans are highly segmented, catering to diverse user needs and budgets.

{"unnormalised": "The affordability of data plans has had a profound impact on various sectors of the Indian economy. It has fueled the growth of e-commerce, online education, and digital entertainment. It has also empowered individuals in rural areas, connecting them to information and opportunities that were previously inaccessible. Villagers in places like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar can now access government schemes and market prices online, improving their livelihoods.", "normalised": "The affordability of data plans has had a profound impact on various sectors of the Indian economy.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring consistent network connectivity and quality of service across the country, especially in remote areas, remains a priority. Furthermore, the digital divide persists, with affordability still being a barrier for some segments of the population. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a crucial role in regulating the sector and ensuring fair competition, consumer protection, and affordable access to data services. For instance, TRAI released guidelines regarding data tariffs on 15/01/2020 (15th January 2020) to prevent predatory pricing.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the rollout of 5G technology promises even faster speeds and lower latency, which will further transform the data plan landscape. Expect to see more innovative data plans tailored for specific use cases, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The ongoing auction of 5G spectrum, scheduled to conclude on 31/07/2022, will determine the speed of its implementation and the future direction of data plans offered by Indian telecom operators.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the rollout of five G technology promises even faster speeds and lower latency, which will further transform the data plan landscape.
