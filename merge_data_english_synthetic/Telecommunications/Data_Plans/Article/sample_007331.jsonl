{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration. Users should assess their daily and monthly data consumption, geographical coverage needs, and desired bundled services. Comparison websites and mobile operator apps offer valuable tools for comparing plans and making informed decisions. For instance, a student preparing for the IIT entrance exams might prioritize a plan offering access to educational resources and online tutorials, even if it means slightly higher data costs. Remember to check for hidden charges and data throttling policies, which often come into effect after exhausting the allocated data.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration.
