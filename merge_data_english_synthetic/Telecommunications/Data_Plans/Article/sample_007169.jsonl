{"unnormalised": "In the Indian context, the evolution of data plans has been nothing short of revolutionary. Just a decade ago, accessing even a small amount of data could cost a significant sum, hindering widespread internet adoption. Today, thanks to fierce competition between telecom providers like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea, India boasts some of the most affordable data plans globally. This affordability has fueled the explosive growth of mobile internet users, transforming everything from entertainment to education to e-commerce.", "normalised": "In the Indian context, the evolution of data plans has been nothing short of revolutionary.

{"unnormalised": "Data plans are typically structured around validity periods – daily, weekly, monthly, or annual – and come with varying data allowances and additional benefits. Many plans now include unlimited calling, SMS, and access to bundled subscriptions for streaming services like Hotstar or Zee5. The choice of a suitable data plan depends heavily on individual usage patterns. A student primarily using data for online classes and social media might opt for a plan with 1.5 GB daily data, while a business professional frequently engaging in video conferencing and large file transfers may require a plan with significantly higher data limits, perhaps 50 GB per month or more.", "normalised": "Data plans are typically structured around validity periods – daily, weekly, monthly, or annual – and come with varying data allowances and additional benefits.
