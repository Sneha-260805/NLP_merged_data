The affordability of data plans, especially for low-income households, is another concern. Dr. Sharma, a renowned economist at IIM Ahmedabad, argues that “bridging the digital divide requires a combination of infrastructure development and innovative data plan designs that cater to the specific needs of rural communities.” For example, offering subsidized data plans through government initiatives or providing community Wi-Fi hotspots in villages.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
