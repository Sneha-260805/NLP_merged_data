{"unnormalised": "The price points vary considerably, but a 2GB per day plan with a validity of 28 days generally costs around Rs. 249-Rs. 299, depending on the telecom operator and any promotional offers. Many plans also include access to bundled content such as streaming services like JioCinema or Airtel Xstream, adding further value for consumers. Postpaid plans, while less prevalent, offer higher data allowances and additional benefits such as priority network access, catering to users with heavier data consumption needs, often costing upwards of Rs. 499 per month for a substantial data quota.", "normalised": "The price points vary considerably, but a two gigabyte per day plan with a validity of twenty eight days generally costs around rupee two hundred and forty nine slash rupee two hundred and ninety nine, depending on the telecom operator and any promotional offers.

{"unnormalised": "One key consideration is the fine print. Users should carefully examine the fair usage policy (FUP) limits, which dictate the speed at which data is provided after the daily or monthly allowance is exhausted. Exceeding the FUP limit typically results in a significant drop in speed, often to a crawl. Also, understanding the validity period and any auto-renewal options is essential to avoid unexpected charges.", "normalised": "One key consideration is the fine print.
