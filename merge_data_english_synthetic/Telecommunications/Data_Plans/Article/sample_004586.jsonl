{"unnormalised": "The fundamental aspect of a data plan is, of course, the data allowance itself, usually measured in GB (Gigabytes). Plans range from basic offerings with a few GBs for light users who primarily use WhatsApp and occasional browsing, to substantial plans exceeding 100 GB for heavy data consumers who stream videos, play online games, and engage in video conferencing. Operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer a spectrum of choices, often bundled with calling and SMS benefits.", "normalised": "The fundamental aspect of a data plan is, of course, the data allowance itself, usually measured in G B (Gigabytes). Plans range from basic offerings with a few G B s for light users who primarily use WhatsApp and occasional browsing, to substantial plans exceeding one hundred G B for heavy data consumers who stream videos, play online games, and engage in video conferencing. Operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I) offer a spectrum of choices, often bundled with calling and S M S benefits."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the data allowance, speed is a crucial consideration. 4G LTE networks are now widespread, offering reasonable speeds for most applications. However, the advent of 5G is gradually transforming the sector, promising significantly faster speeds and lower latency, particularly beneficial for technologies like AR/VR and IoT (Internet of Things). Keep in mind that advertised speeds are often theoretical maximums; actual speeds can vary depending on factors like network congestion and device capabilities. A consumer in Delhi might experience different speeds compared to someone in a rural area like a village near Udaipur.", "normalised": "Beyond the data allowance, speed is a crucial consideration. 4G L T E networks are now widespread, offering reasonable speeds for most applications.

{"unnormalised": "Data plan pricing varies significantly. Prepaid plans are immensely popular in India, offering flexibility and control over spending. These typically range from Rs. 149 for basic validity packs with limited data to upwards of Rs. 700-800 for plans offering substantial data and OTT (Over-The-Top) platform subscriptions. Postpaid plans, on the other hand, often offer higher data allowances and additional benefits like data rollover, albeit with a recurring monthly commitment.", "normalised": "Data plan pricing varies significantly.

{"unnormalised": "Another aspect to consider is Fair Usage Policy (FUP). Most plans have a FUP, which means that after consuming the allocated data, the speed is reduced significantly, often to a crawl. Some plans offer data top-ups to restore faster speeds once the FUP limit is reached.", "normalised": "Another aspect to consider is Fair Usage Policy (F U P).
