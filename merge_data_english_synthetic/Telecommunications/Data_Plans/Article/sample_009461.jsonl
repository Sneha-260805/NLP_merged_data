{"unnormalised": "In India's burgeoning telecommunications sector, data plans have become essential for connecting millions to the internet. These plans, offered by various telecom operators like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi), determine the amount of data a user can consume within a specified validity period. Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of usage patterns, budget constraints, and network coverage.", "normalised": "In India's burgeoning telecommunications sector, data plans have become essential for connecting millions to the internet.

{"unnormalised": "Data plans are generally categorized based on several factors. One key aspect is the data allowance, ranging from daily data limits (e.g., 1 GB per day) to bulk data plans (e.g., 50 GB for the entire period). Daily data plans are popular amongst students and casual users, while those who stream videos frequently or work remotely often opt for higher data allowances. For example, a resident of Mumbai might need a high-bandwidth plan to support online meetings and streaming services in a shared apartment of 600 sq ft.", "normalised": "Data plans are generally categorized based on several factors.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial factor is the validity period. Plans can range from a few days (e.g., 28 days) to a year (365 days), offering flexibility to subscribers. Long-term plans are often favored by individuals looking for cost savings, while short-term plans provide more agility for users with fluctuating data needs. Many plans now come bundled with unlimited voice calls (local and STD) and SMS benefits, adding further value.", "normalised": "Another crucial factor is the validity period. Plans can range from a few days (for example, twenty eight days) to a year (three hundred and sixty five days), offering flexibility to subscribers.

Many plans now come bundled with unlimited voice calls (local and S T D) and S M S benefits, adding further value."}
{"unnormalised": "Pricing is, of course, a significant driver in plan selection. Data plans in India are known for their affordability, but the 'best' plan is subjective and depends on individual requirements. Operators often introduce promotional offers and discounts, especially during festive seasons like Diwali and Holi, making the market highly competitive. For instance, Jio might offer an additional 10 GB of data with a Rs. 555 recharge during the festival period.", "normalised": "Pricing is, of course, a significant driver in plan selection.

For instance, J I O might offer an additional ten gigabyte of data with a rupee five hundred and fifty five recharge during the festival period."}
{"unnormalised": "Network coverage plays a pivotal role in ensuring a satisfactory data experience. Even the best data plan is rendered useless if the signal strength is weak. Before committing to a long-term plan, it is wise to check network coverage in your area. Users living in remote areas, such as certain regions of Rajasthan or Jammu & Kashmir, might experience slower speeds or intermittent connectivity, regardless of the data plan they choose. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) actively monitors network performance and customer satisfaction.", "normalised": "Network coverage plays a pivotal role in ensuring a satisfactory data experience.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the emergence of 5G technology is revolutionizing the Indian telecom landscape. While 4G continues to be widely used, 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling a new era of applications and services. Dr. Sharma from IIT Delhi predicts that 5G adoption will accelerate significantly in the coming years, leading to a shift in data plan offerings and pricing strategies. Consider your device’s compatibility with 5G if you are looking at future-proofing your connection. Be aware of extra charges.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the emergence of five G technology is revolutionizing the Indian telecom landscape.
