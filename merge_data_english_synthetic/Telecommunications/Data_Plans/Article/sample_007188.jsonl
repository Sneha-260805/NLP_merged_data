{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecom market, fiercely competitive and largely driven by affordability, has witnessed a dynamic evolution in data plan offerings. Reliance Jio's disruptive entry a few years back, offering data at extremely low prices, forced other players like Airtel and Vodafone Idea to drastically revise their plans. Today, users in even rural areas can access 4G and 5G networks, opening up a world of digital possibilities.", "normalised": "The Indian telecom market, fiercely competitive and largely driven by affordability, has witnessed a dynamic evolution in data plan offerings.

{"unnormalised": "A typical data plan in India includes a specified amount of high-speed data (e.g., 1.5 GB per day, 2GB per day, or a lump sum of 50 GB) along with other benefits. These often include unlimited voice calls to any network in India, a certain number of SMS messages (e.g., 100 SMS per day), and access to bundled services like streaming platforms (e.g., Disney+ Hotstar Mobile), music apps (e.g., Gaana), or cloud storage solutions.", "normalised": "A typical data plan in India includes a specified amount of high-speed data (e.g., one point five gigabyte per day, two gigabyte per day, or a lump sum of fifty gigabyte) along with other benefits.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing of these plans varies considerably based on the amount of data offered, the validity period, and the bundled services included. For instance, a basic plan offering 1 GB of data per day for 28 days might cost around Rs. 250, while a premium plan with unlimited data and access to multiple OTT platforms for 84 days could set you back by Rs. 800 or more.", "normalised": "The pricing of these plans varies considerably based on the amount of data offered, the validity period, and the bundled services included.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves careful consideration of individual needs and usage patterns. Students relying heavily on online learning might opt for plans with high data allowances, while those who primarily use their phones for calls and messaging could choose a basic plan with limited data. Factors like network coverage in your area (especially important when travelling through the ghats near Ooty), speed, and customer service also play crucial roles.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves careful consideration of individual needs and usage patterns.
