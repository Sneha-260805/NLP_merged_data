{"unnormalised": "A typical data plan in India comprises a specific data allowance (expressed in GB or TB), validity period (ranging from daily to annual), and often bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls and SMS messages. For instance, a student in Delhi might opt for a daily data plan of 1.5 GB from Jio, priced around Rs. 249 for a month, sufficient for online classes and social media. Conversely, a professional in Mumbai, heavily reliant on video conferencing and large file transfers, might choose a monthly plan with 50 GB of data, offered by Airtel or Vodafone Idea (Vi).", "normalised": "A typical data plan in India comprises a specific data allowance (expressed in G B or T B), validity period (ranging from daily to annual), and often bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls and S M S messages.

Speed throttling after exceeding the daily or monthly limit is a common practice, frustrating users attempting bandwidth-intensive tasks. Fair Usage Policy (FUP) limits can significantly impact the user experience, particularly for those consuming streaming content.", "normalised": "However, data plans are not without their limitations.

Network congestion, especially during peak hours in densely populated cities like Bangalore or Kolkata, can lead to slower download and upload speeds. Factors like the type of device used, signal strength, and distance from the nearest cell tower also contribute to these discrepancies.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the actual data speed experienced by users often varies from the advertised speed.

{"unnormalised": "The future of data plans in India is likely to be shaped by the rollout of 5G technology. 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications such as augmented reality, IoT (Internet of Things), and advanced telemedicine. This increased bandwidth capacity could potentially lead to the evolution of data plans, with operators offering packages designed for specific 5G use cases, like high-definition video streaming or online gaming. For example, a household in Chennai with smart home devices consuming vast data might require a plan offering 1000 GB of data at speeds enabling seamless operation over an area of 2000 sq ft.", "normalised": "The future of data plans in India is likely to be shaped by the rollout of five G technology. five G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications such as augmented reality, I O T (Internet of Things), and advanced telemedicine.
