{"unnormalised": "These data plans range from basic entry-level packs offering limited data (e.g., 1 GB per day) targeted at users primarily engaging in light browsing and social media, to high-end plans providing unlimited data access with bundled OTT subscriptions and premium services. The introduction of bundled plans, often incorporating voice calls and SMS, reflects a strategy to enhance customer retention and increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). For example, a popular plan offered by Airtel in Mumbai provides 2GB data per day, unlimited calls and 100 SMS/day for Rs. 299 with a validity of 28 days. Such offers frequently change, especially around festive seasons like Diwali.", "normalised": "These data plans range from basic entry-level packs offering limited data (e.g., one G B per day) targeted at users primarily engaging in light browsing and social media, to high-end plans providing unlimited data access with bundled O T T subscriptions and premium services.

{"unnormalised": "The accessibility of data plans has been a game-changer, particularly for rural India. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh now access real-time market prices through their smartphones, enabling them to make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce. Students in remote villages like those in Arunachal Pradesh are now able to access online education resources, bridging the digital divide and expanding educational opportunities. This digital transformation, driven by affordable data, is arguably more impactful than any other single factor in empowering citizens.", "normalised": "The accessibility of data plans has been a game-changer, particularly for rural India.

Ensuring consistent network coverage and reliable data speeds, especially in densely populated urban areas like Delhi and Kolkata, remains a constant struggle. Furthermore, the pricing of data plans is a sensitive issue, with calls for greater affordability and transparency. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) continues to play a crucial role in regulating the market, ensuring fair competition and protecting consumer interests.

As 5G networks become more ubiquitous, expect to see the emergence of data plans tailored to specific use cases, such as gaming, augmented reality, and IoT applications. The increasing demand for content streaming will also drive the development of data plans optimized for video consumption. We anticipate increased bandwidth usage by at least 50% by 15/08/2025. Jio’s launch date, 05/09/2016, forever altered the Indian telecom landscape.
