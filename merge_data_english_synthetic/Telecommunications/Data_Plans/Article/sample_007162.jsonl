{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India typically fall into several categories: daily data plans, validity-based plans, and unlimited data plans (often with fair-usage policies). Daily data plans offer a fixed amount of data per day, ranging from 1GB to 5GB or more, with validity periods spanning from 1 day to 84 days. These are popular among users with consistent daily usage patterns. Validity-based plans, on the other hand, provide a lump sum of data valid for a specified duration, such as 28 days, 56 days, or 365 days. These are suitable for users with fluctuating data needs.", "normalised": "Data plans in India typically fall into several categories: daily data plans, validity-based plans, and unlimited data plans (often with fair-usage policies).

{"unnormalised": "\"Unlimited\" data plans are marketed as offering unrestricted data access, but often come with a Fair Usage Policy (FUP). Once the FUP limit, say 2GB per day, is exhausted, the data speed is throttled to significantly lower speeds, sometimes as low as 64kbps. Consumers need to carefully read the fine print to understand the FUP limitations.", "normalised": "\"Unlimited\" data plans are marketed as offering unrestricted data access, but often come with a Fair Usage Policy (F U P). Once the F U P limit, say two gigabytes per day, is exhausted, the data speed is throttled to significantly lower speeds, sometimes as low as sixty four kilobits per second. Consumers need to carefully read the fine print to understand the F U P limitations."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence the pricing of data plans, including the amount of data offered, the validity period, and any bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls or access to streaming services like Zee5 or Hotstar. Telecom operators such as Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) fiercely compete for market share, frequently revising their data plans and offering promotional deals, especially around festive seasons like Diwali.", "normalised": "Several factors influence the pricing of data plans, including the amount of data offered, the validity period, and any bundled benefits like unlimited voice calls or access to streaming services like Zee five or Hotstar.

{"unnormalised": "For example, a Jio plan might offer 2GB of data per day for 28 days at Rs. 299, while an Airtel plan could provide 1.5GB of data per day for 56 days at Rs. 399. Users must compare these offers considering their individual data needs and usage patterns.", "normalised": "For example, a Jio plan might offer two gigabytes of data per day for twenty eight days at rupee two hundred and ninety nine, while an Airtel plan could provide one point five gigabytes of data per day for fifty six days at rupee three hundred and ninety nine.

{"unnormalised": "The rollout of 5G technology in India is expected to further revolutionize data plans. While 4G provided a significant boost in data speeds, 5G promises even faster speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications and services. This will likely lead to the introduction of new data plans tailored for 5G devices and use cases. We can expect to see plans offering speeds reaching several hundred Mbps, though pricing and availability will be key factors determining adoption.", "normalised": "The rollout of five G technology in India is expected to further revolutionize data plans.
