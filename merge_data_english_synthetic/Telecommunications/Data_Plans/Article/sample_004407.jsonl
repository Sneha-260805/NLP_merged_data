{"unnormalised": "Broadly, data plans can be categorized based on several factors. Firstly, validity: daily data plans, typically offering 1 GB to 3 GB per day, cater to users with consistent daily usage. Monthly plans, ranging from 28 days to 84 days, provide a larger overall data allowance and are popular for their extended validity. Then there are annual plans, which offer a significant data volume, often accompanied by bundled benefits like unlimited calling and access to OTT platforms, suitable for heavy data users seeking long-term value.", "normalised": "Broadly, data plans can be categorized based on several factors. Firstly, validity: daily data plans, typically offering one gigabyte to three gigabytes per day, cater to users with consistent daily usage. Monthly plans, ranging from twenty eight days to eighty four days, provide a larger overall data allowance and are popular for their extended validity. Then there are annual plans, which offer a significant data volume, often accompanied by bundled benefits like unlimited calling and access to O T T platforms, suitable for heavy data users seeking long-term value."}
{"unnormalised": "Another key differentiator is the data allowance itself. Low-data plans, offering perhaps 2GB to 5GB per month, are suitable for basic users who primarily use WhatsApp and light browsing. Mid-range plans, in the 20GB to 50GB range, cater to users who stream videos and engage in moderate social media activity. High-data plans, offering 100GB or more, are designed for users who consume large amounts of data through streaming, gaming, and downloading. The price varies accordingly, from approximately Rs. 149 for basic monthly plans to upwards of Rs. 2,500 for comprehensive annual options.", "normalised": "Another key differentiator is the data allowance itself. Low-data plans, offering perhaps two gigabytes to five gigabytes per month, are suitable for basic users who primarily use WhatsApp and light browsing. Mid-range plans, in the twenty gigabytes to fifty gigabytes range, cater to users who stream videos and engage in moderate social media activity. High-data plans, offering one hundred gigabytes or more, are designed for users who consume large amounts of data through streaming, gaming, and downloading. The price varies accordingly, from approximately rupees one hundred and forty nine for basic monthly plans to upwards of rupees two thousand five hundred for comprehensive annual options."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the inclusion of value-added services plays a significant role. Many operators, including Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea, offer bundled subscriptions to streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Zee5, alongside unlimited calling and SMS benefits. These bundles provide added value, particularly for entertainment enthusiasts.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the inclusion of value-added services plays a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "However, consumers should pay close attention to the fine print. Data speeds can vary significantly based on network coverage and congestion, especially in densely populated areas like Delhi or Mumbai. Fair Usage Policy (FUP) limits are also critical. Exceeding the allocated data allowance often results in significantly reduced speeds, impacting the user experience. Checking network coverage maps and reading customer reviews can provide valuable insights before choosing a plan.", "normalised": "However, consumers should pay close attention to the fine print.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the trend towards 5G data plans is rapidly gaining momentum. While 5G availability is still limited in many parts of India, operators are aggressively rolling out their networks. These plans promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency, enabling applications like cloud gaming and augmented reality. However, 5G-enabled devices are required to take full advantage of these plans. Choosing the right data plan is about understanding your individual needs and weighing the various factors at play. Consider your data consumption habits, budget, and the availability of network coverage in your area to make an informed decision and ensure a seamless digital experience, whether you’re enjoying a plate of biryani while video-calling family or attending a virtual conference.", "normalised": "Finally, the trend towards five G data plans is rapidly gaining momentum.
