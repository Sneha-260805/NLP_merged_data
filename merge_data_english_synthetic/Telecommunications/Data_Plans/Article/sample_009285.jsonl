{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecom market is characterized by intense competition, resulting in a plethora of data plans offered by giants like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi). These plans vary significantly based on data allowance, validity period, speed, and bundled benefits. For example, a typical entry-level plan might offer 1GB of data per day for 28 days at a price point of around Rs. 250. Higher-tier plans could include unlimited data (with fair usage policies), access to streaming services like Hotstar, and even international roaming benefits.", "normalised": "The Indian telecom market is characterized by intense competition, resulting in a plethora of data plans offered by giants like Reliance J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I).

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves carefully assessing individual usage patterns. Factors to consider include daily data consumption, reliance on Wi-Fi, and the frequency of video streaming or online gaming. A student living in Delhi and primarily using data for online classes and social media might find a plan with 1.5GB daily data sufficient. On the other hand, a businessman in Mumbai constantly on video conferences would likely require a plan with higher data limits or even a truly unlimited offering.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves carefully assessing individual usage patterns.

{"unnormalised": "The validity period is another important consideration. Plans are typically offered with validity ranging from a few days to a year. Longer-term plans often provide better value for money, but it's crucial to assess whether the data allowance and other benefits align with long-term needs. Some providers also offer data add-ons, allowing users to top up their data allowance if they run out before the plan's expiry date. For instance, a user might purchase an additional 2GB data pack for Rs. 50 to get through a weekend trip to Goa.", "normalised": "The validity period is another important consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowance and validity, bundled benefits can also sway the decision. Many plans now include free calls to any network, which was a major selling point in the past. Some also offer access to premium content, such as music streaming services or online learning platforms. During festivals like Onam, telecom providers often launch special offers with increased data limits or bundled discounts, making it a great time to upgrade your plan.", "normalised": "Beyond data allowance and validity, bundled benefits can also sway the decision.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, it’s vital to be aware of the fair usage policy (FUP) associated with “unlimited” data plans. While advertised as unlimited, these plans typically throttle speeds after a certain data limit is reached. This can significantly impact the user experience, especially for activities like streaming HD videos or downloading large files. Imagine trying to download the latest season of \"Family Man\" on a throttled connection – not ideal.", "normalised": "Finally, it’s vital to be aware of the fair usage policy (F U P) associated with “unlimited” data plans.
