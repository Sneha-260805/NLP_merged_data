{"unnormalised": "Typically, data plans are categorized based on validity (e.g., 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, 365 days) and data allowance. Many plans also incorporate daily data caps, which, once exhausted, reduce the internet speed considerably. For instance, a plan might offer 2 GB of data per day for 28 days. Post the daily limit, the speed might throttle down to 64 kbps.", "normalised": "Typically, data plans are categorized based on validity (e.g., twenty eight days, fifty six days, eighty four days, three hundred and sixty five days) and data allowance. Many plans also incorporate daily data caps, which, once exhausted, reduce the internet speed considerably. For instance, a plan might offer two gigabytes of data per day for twenty eight days. Post the daily limit, the speed might throttle down to sixty four kilobits per second."}
{"unnormalised": "The introduction of 5G technology is further transforming data plans. Operators are now offering 5G-specific plans that promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency. These plans are particularly attractive to users who consume a lot of bandwidth, such as gamers and those who frequently stream high-definition video content. It’s estimated that 5G data consumption in urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi could be significantly higher than that of 4G in the coming years.", "normalised": "The introduction of five G technology is further transforming data plans.

{"unnormalised": "The average Indian consumer spends a significant portion of their monthly income on data plans. Data plans in rural areas around Lucknow and Patna tend to be cheaper with more limited data and a smaller sq ft of coverage area. Therefore, affordability remains a key factor influencing purchasing decisions. A typical recharge might cost Rs. 299 for 1.5 GB of data per day for 28 days. Dr. Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, emphasizes the importance of affordable and accessible internet for promoting digital literacy and economic empowerment, especially in underserved communities. Analyzing data consumption patterns in different regions and demographics is crucial for operators to tailor their offerings effectively. Ultimately, the future of telecommunications in India hinges on providing robust and affordable data connectivity to its vast population.", "normalised": "The average Indian consumer spends a significant portion of their monthly income on data plans.
