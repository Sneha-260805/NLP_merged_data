{"unnormalised": "Firstly, it's essential to differentiate between prepaid and postpaid plans. Prepaid plans, ubiquitous across India, offer flexibility and control. A user recharges their account with a specified amount, such as Rs. 299 for 1.5 GB per day for 28 days, offered by providers like Jio or Airtel. Postpaid plans, on the other hand, involve a monthly bill based on usage. These often come with added benefits like bundled calls, SMS, and sometimes even access to streaming services, catering to heavier data users.", "normalised": "Firstly, it is essential to differentiate between prepaid and postpaid plans.

{"unnormalised": "Data allowances are the core of any data plan. It's crucial to assess your typical monthly data consumption. Streaming videos, especially in HD or 4K resolution, consumes significant data. Social media usage, online gaming, and downloading files also contribute to the overall data footprint. If you’re a frequent traveler, consider plans offering roaming data benefits, especially when venturing beyond your circle.", "normalised": "Data allowances are the core of any data plan.

{"unnormalised": "Speed is another critical factor. 4G is now commonplace, but 5G is rapidly expanding, promising significantly faster download and upload speeds. However, the actual speed experienced can vary depending on network congestion and signal strength in your area. Check the provider's coverage map and read user reviews to get a realistic understanding of the speeds offered in your locality, be it Delhi or a village 50 km from Pune.", "normalised": "Speed is another critical factor.

{"unnormalised": "Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is a common practice. Most \"unlimited\" data plans actually have a daily or monthly FUP limit. Once the FUP is exhausted, the speed is throttled to a significantly slower rate, often around 64 Kbps or 128 Kbps. This can be frustrating, particularly when relying on data for essential tasks. Some plans offer the option to purchase additional data packs to overcome FUP limitations. For instance, you might have to shell out an extra Rs. 48 for 3GB data if you finish your daily quota.", "normalised": "Fair Usage Policy (F U P) is a common practice. Most \"unlimited\" data plans actually have a daily or monthly F U P limit. Once the F U P is exhausted, the speed is throttled to a significantly slower rate, often around sixty four kilobits per second or one hundred and twenty eight kilobits per second. This can be frustrating, particularly when relying on data for essential tasks. Some plans offer the option to purchase additional data packs to overcome F U P limitations. For instance, you might have to shell out an extra rupees forty eight for three gigabyte data if you finish your daily quota."}
{"unnormalised": "The validity period of a data plan is also an important consideration. Plans typically range from a few days to a year. Longer validity plans can offer better value for money, but require upfront payment. With Onam approaching, many providers offer special data plans with extra data benefits and entertainment subscriptions to entice customers during the festive season.", "normalised": "The validity period of a data plan is also an important consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowances and speed, consider the bundled services offered. Some plans include free access to streaming platforms like Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video. Others offer unlimited calling benefits or complimentary SMS packages. Evaluate whether these bundled services align with your needs and preferences. Also, look out for plans that offer data rollover benefits, allowing you to carry forward unused data from one billing cycle to the next.
