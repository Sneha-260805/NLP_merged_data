{"unnormalised": "Data plans essentially offer a pre-determined allowance of data, measured in gigabytes (GB), for a fixed period, typically 28 days, 30 days, or a longer duration like 84 days or even an annual plan. These plans are offered by various telecommunication operators like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and BSNL, each vying for market share by offering competitive pricing and bundled services.", "normalised": "Data plans essentially offer a predetermined allowance of data, measured in gigabytes (G B), for a fixed period, typically twenty eight days, thirty days, or a longer duration like eighty four days or even an annual plan.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual needs. Factors to consider include monthly data consumption, network coverage in specific areas like remote villages in Rajasthan or congested urban centers like Bangalore, and the type of usage – streaming video, online gaming, or simple email and WhatsApp communication. For instance, someone frequently streaming Bollywood movies or engaging in online gaming on their commute from Gurgaon to Connaught Place would require a plan with a significantly larger data allowance than someone primarily using data for basic communication.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual needs.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the data allowance itself, other aspects of data plans are important. Post-paid plans often offer greater flexibility, allowing users to exceed their data limit and pay for the overage, although this can result in unexpectedly high bills. Pre-paid plans, on the other hand, are more predictable, often stopping data access once the limit is reached or drastically reducing speeds. Some plans offer data rollover, allowing unused data from one period to be carried over to the next, providing additional value.", "normalised": "Beyond the data allowance itself, other aspects of data plans are important.

Telecom operators frequently launch special data plans and offers during these periods to cater to the increased demand.

{"unnormalised": "Data speeds are another critical factor. While 4G LTE is widely available in most parts of India, the rollout of 5G is rapidly changing the landscape, offering significantly faster speeds and lower latency. However, 5G availability and compatible devices are still relatively limited, so choosing a plan based solely on 5G availability might not be practical for everyone just yet. Furthermore, the cost of data continues to be a significant factor, particularly for low-income households in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Operators are constantly innovating to offer more affordable data plans, sometimes even partnering with local institutions and businesses to provide subsidized access. Rs. 299 for 2 GB per day used to be a common benchmark, but pricing is constantly evolving. The TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) plays a crucial role in regulating the industry and ensuring fair competition and consumer protection. The future of data plans in India hinges on continued innovation, affordability, and widespread access to high-speed internet, bridging the digital divide and empowering individuals and communities across the nation. Some plans even include free access to popular OTT platforms, offering a complete entertainment package.", "normalised": "Data speeds are another critical factor.
