{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are primarily offered by major telecom operators such as Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi). These plans are typically categorized based on validity period (e.g., 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, 365 days), data allowance (e.g., 1 GB/day, 2 GB/day, unlimited), and additional benefits like bundled voice calls, SMS, and subscriptions to Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms like Disney+ Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are primarily offered by major telecom operators such as J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V I). These plans are typically categorized based on validity period (for example, twenty eight days, fifty six days, eighty four days, three hundred and sixty five days), data allowance (for example, one G B per day, two G B per day, unlimited), and additional benefits like bundled voice calls, S M S, and subscriptions to Over-The-Top (O T T) platforms like Disney+ Hotstar or Amazon Prime Video."}
{"unnormalised": "The cost of these plans varies significantly based on these factors. For instance, a basic 28-day plan with 1.5 GB of data per day might cost around Rs. 249, while a longer-term annual plan offering 2 GB of data daily could be priced upwards of Rs. 2999. Operators frequently offer promotional data packs and combo deals, especially around festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, to attract and retain customers. These deals may include extra data or cashback offers.", "normalised": "The cost of these plans varies significantly based on these factors. For instance, a basic twenty eight-day plan with one point five G B of data per day might cost around rupee two hundred and forty nine, while a longer-term annual plan offering two G B of data daily could be priced upwards of rupee two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine.

{"unnormalised": "The advent of 5G technology is further reshaping the data plan landscape. While 5G services are still being rolled out across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, operators are introducing 5G-enabled data plans that promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency. These plans are generally priced higher than their 4G counterparts and require a compatible 5G device.", "normalised": "The advent of five G technology is further reshaping the data plan landscape. While five G services are still being rolled out across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, operators are introducing five G-enabled data plans that promise significantly faster speeds and lower latency.

{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves considering several factors. Firstly, users should assess their data consumption habits. How much data do they typically use per day or month? Do they primarily browse social media, stream videos, or use data-intensive applications? Secondly, coverage is crucial. While national coverage is generally good, network quality can vary in rural areas or certain regions like the hilly terrain of Himachal Pradesh or the dense urban sprawls of Kolkata. Thirdly, the bundled benefits should align with the user’s needs. Is a subscription to an OTT platform valuable? Do they require unlimited voice calls?", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan involves considering several factors. Firstly, users should assess their data consumption habits.
