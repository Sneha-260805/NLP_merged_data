{"unnormalised": "The basic building block is the data allowance itself, typically measured in Gigabytes (GB). Major telecom players like Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and Reliance Jio offer a wide range, from budget-friendly plans with 1 GB per day to more robust options with 3 GB or even unlimited data. It's crucial to estimate your monthly data consumption. Consider the average time you spend on activities like social media (Facebook, Instagram), video streaming (YouTube, Hotstar), online gaming (like PUBG or Free Fire), and browsing. A student living in Delhi, for instance, might require more data if attending online lectures regularly, compared to a senior citizen in Kerala who primarily uses it for occasional video calls.", "normalised": "The basic building block is the data allowance itself, typically measured in Gigabytes (G B).

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the raw data allowance, several factors differentiate data plans. Validity periods vary, ranging from daily packs (24 hours) to monthly, quarterly, or even annual plans. Shorter validity packs often come with higher per-GB costs but offer flexibility for occasional users. Longer validity plans, like the annual Rs. 2999 plan offered by some providers, generally provide better value for money for heavy users.", "normalised": "Beyond the raw data allowance, several factors differentiate data plans.

{"unnormalised": "Data speed is another critical consideration. While 4G speeds are widely available in most urban areas, the actual speed experienced can vary based on network congestion, location (e.g., a densely populated area like Mumbai's Dadar versus a less congested area in Rajasthan), and the device being used. Newer 5G networks promise significantly faster speeds, but widespread availability is still under development.", "normalised": "Data speed is another critical consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Many plans also bundle additional benefits. These might include unlimited voice calls (local and STD), SMS messages, subscriptions to streaming services like Zee5, or access to bundled apps offered by the telecom operator. For instance, Airtel Thanks offers benefits such as access to Wynk Music and free Hellotunes. Vi offers “Binge All Night” which gives unlimited data from 12 AM to 6 AM.", "normalised": "Many plans also bundle additional benefits.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is something everyone in India needs to understand. Even plans marketed as “unlimited” often have FUP limits. Once you exceed the daily or monthly FUP limit, your data speed is throttled down significantly, often to a crawl. Understanding the fine print regarding FUP is vital to avoid unexpected disruptions. Imagine Dr. Sharma trying to conduct a telemedicine consultation from his clinic in Patna only to have his video connection drop due to FUP limitations!", "normalised": "Finally, Fair Usage Policy (F U P) is something everyone in India needs to understand.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, selecting the right data plan involves careful consideration of individual needs, usage patterns, and budget. Comparing plans from different providers, paying attention to validity, speed, FUP limitations, and bundled benefits, is essential to making an informed decision. Remember to check network coverage in your area using maps or by asking neighbors about their experiences. This thoughtful approach will ensure you are getting the most value for your Rs. in this competitive market. Choosing a plan based on the sq ft area of your home network's reach, though, isn't recommended.", "normalised": "In conclusion, selecting the right data plan involves careful consideration of individual needs, usage patterns, and budget.
