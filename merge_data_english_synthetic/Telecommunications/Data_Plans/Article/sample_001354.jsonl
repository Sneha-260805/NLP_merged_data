A student in Delhi using data primarily for online classes and social media might find a plan with 1GB daily sufficient. However, a professional in Mumbai who frequently attends video conferences and downloads large files might require a plan offering 2GB or even 3GB per day.", "normalised": "Choosing the ideal data plan requires careful consideration of individual usage patterns. A student in Delhi using data primarily for online classes and social media might find a plan with one G-B daily sufficient.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond data allowance, factors like network coverage and speed also play a crucial role. While a plan offering 2GB per day might sound attractive, it’s only valuable if the network signal is strong and the internet speed is consistent in the user's area, whether it's a bustling metro like Bengaluru or a remote village in Rajasthan.", "normalised": "Beyond data allowance, factors like network coverage and speed also play a crucial role.

Utilizing data monitoring tools and adjusting app settings can help optimize data consumption and avoid exceeding the data limit before the plan's validity expires. Understanding the fine print, including fair usage policies (FUP) and data rollover options, is also essential for making informed decisions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, awareness about data usage is paramount.
