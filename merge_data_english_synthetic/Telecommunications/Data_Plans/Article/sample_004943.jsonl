{"unnormalised": "A data plan, at its core, is an agreement between a mobile network operator like Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi), or Reliance Jio, and a subscriber, providing a specific allowance of data (measured in MBs or GBs) for a pre-determined period, typically 28 days, 56 days, or 84 days. These plans come in various shapes and sizes, each catering to different usage patterns and budgets.", "normalised": "A data plan, at its core, is an agreement between a mobile network operator like Airtel, Vodafone Idea (V I), or Reliance Jio, and a subscriber, providing a specific allowance of data (measured in megabytes or gigabytes) for a pre-determined period, typically twenty eight days, fifty six days, or eighty four days. These plans come in various shapes and sizes, each catering to different usage patterns and budgets."}
{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan can be a daunting task, especially considering the sheer volume of options available. Several factors need careful consideration. Firstly, assess your monthly data consumption. Track how much data you typically use for activities such as browsing social media, streaming video content (like watching the latest episode of \"The Family Man\"), video conferencing with family in Chennai, and downloading files. Many smartphones have built-in data usage trackers that can provide valuable insights.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan can be a daunting task, especially considering the sheer volume of options available.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, consider the validity period. While a shorter validity period (e.g., 28 days) might seem cheaper upfront, it requires more frequent recharges, potentially leading to higher overall costs. Conversely, a longer validity period (e.g., 84 days or even a year) might be more cost-effective in the long run, especially if you are a heavy data user. For instance, Jio offers annual plans starting from Rs. 2999, providing a substantial amount of data and unlimited voice calls.", "normalised": "Secondly, consider the validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, pay attention to the fine print. Some plans offer \"unlimited\" data, but often come with Fair Usage Policies (FUPs). This means that after consuming a certain amount of data (e.g., 2GB per day), the speed gets throttled down to a significantly slower speed (e.g., 64 kbps), making activities like streaming videos almost impossible.", "normalised": "Thirdly, pay attention to the fine print. Some plans offer \"unlimited\" data, but often come with Fair Usage Policies (F U P s). This means that after consuming a certain amount of data (e.g., two gigabytes per day), the speed gets throttled down to a significantly slower speed (e.g., sixty four kilobits per second), making activities like streaming videos almost impossible."}
{"unnormalised": "Moreover, consider bundled benefits. Many data plans now offer additional perks such as free access to OTT platforms like Amazon Prime Video Mobile Edition or Disney+ Hotstar, or even discounts on online shopping through platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.

Just like savoring a delicious plate of Hyderabadi biryani, choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration and a bit of research to ensure a satisfying experience. With a little effort, you can find a data plan that perfectly fits your needs and keeps you connected in this digital age. Remember to check for hidden charges and ensure transparency in billing. Some operators might levy additional charges for data usage beyond the allotted limit (e.g., Rs. 10 per MB).", "normalised": "Before making a decision, compare data plans across different operators, considering your specific needs and budget.
