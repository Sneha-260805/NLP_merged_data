{"unnormalised": "Data plans are broadly categorized based on their validity and the amount of data offered. Entry-level plans, priced around Rs. 149, might provide 1 GB of data per day for 28 days, suitable for light users who primarily use WhatsApp and occasional browsing. Mid-range plans, costing around Rs. 499, could offer 2 GB of data daily with unlimited calls and other benefits, catering to moderate users who stream videos and engage in social media. High-end plans, priced above Rs. 799, often provide significantly larger data allowances, sometimes even unlimited data with speed throttling after a certain threshold, ideal for heavy users who consume a lot of bandwidth.", "normalised": "Data plans are broadly categorized based on their validity and the amount of data offered.

{"unnormalised": "The fine print of a data plan often holds important details. For example, some plans offer \"unlimited\" data only between 12 AM and 6 AM. Others provide bundled access to OTT platforms like Zee5 or Hotstar. Dr. Sharma, a telecom analyst at IIT Delhi, emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing the terms and conditions. \"Users should pay close attention to data rollover policies, speed restrictions, and any hidden charges to avoid unexpected bill shocks,\" he advises.", "normalised": "The fine print of a data plan often holds important details.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, users in remote areas like Ladakh might find connectivity options and data speeds varying significantly. Telecom infrastructure in sparsely populated regions is often less developed compared to urban centers like Mumbai or Bangalore. Network availability can impact data speeds, potentially turning that promised 4G connection into a sluggish experience.", "normalised": "Furthermore, users in remote areas like Ladakh might find connectivity options and data speeds varying significantly.

{"unnormalised": "The demand for high-speed data continues to rise, particularly in densely populated areas like Dharavi (Mumbai), where space is at a premium (average dwelling size perhaps just 300 sq ft), and mobile internet serves as the primary connection for entertainment, education, and business. Telecommunications companies are constantly investing in improving their infrastructure and expanding their 5G network coverage to meet this growing demand. Ultimately, the ideal data plan depends on individual usage patterns, budget, and location. Thoroughly researching available options and understanding the fine print is key to maximizing value and staying connected in today's digital world.", "normalised": "The demand for high-speed data continues to rise, particularly in densely populated areas like Dharavi, Mumbai, where space is at a premium, average dwelling size perhaps just three hundred square feet, and mobile internet serves as the primary connection for entertainment, education, and business.
