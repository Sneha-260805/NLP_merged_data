{"unnormalised": "The Indian telecom sector is intensely competitive, with major players like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) constantly vying for market share. This competition has resulted in a proliferation of data plans, each with varying data allowances, validity periods, and bundled benefits. For example, a typical plan might offer 2GB of data per day for 28 days, along with unlimited voice calls. Another plan might prioritize long-term validity, offering 50GB of data for 84 days.", "normalised": "The Indian telecom sector is intensely competitive, with major players like Reliance J-i-o, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (V-i) constantly vying for market share.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several factors differentiate various data plans. Data rollover policies, which allow users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle, can be a significant advantage. Some plans also offer data add-ons, enabling users to purchase additional data if they exhaust their monthly allowance. Another differentiating factor is data speeds, with 4G and 5G networks offering drastically different experiences. The rollout of 5G across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore is expected to further enhance data speeds and capabilities, enabling use cases like augmented reality and enhanced video conferencing.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several factors differentiate various data plans.

Businesses, from small kirana stores utilizing digital payment systems to large corporations relying on cloud-based services, are heavily reliant on reliable and affordable data connectivity. Even the real estate sector, with projects involving sprawling constructions on sites extending to 1000 sq ft, demands seamless connectivity for project management and communication. The need for robust data plans is, therefore, pervasive across all sectors of the Indian economy. Dr. Sharma, a leading economist at IIM Ahmedabad, notes that the availability of affordable data has been a significant catalyst for India's digital transformation.", "normalised": "Moreover, the demand for data plans isn't limited to personal use.
