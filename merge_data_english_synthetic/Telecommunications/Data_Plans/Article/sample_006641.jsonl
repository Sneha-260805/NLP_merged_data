{"unnormalised": "Data plans, at their core, are packages offered by telecom operators like Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea that provide subscribers with a pre-defined amount of data usage (measured in MB or GB) for a specific validity period, typically ranging from 28 days to a year. These plans can be broadly categorized into prepaid and postpaid options. Prepaid plans, dominant in the Indian market, require users to recharge their accounts with a fixed amount, receiving a corresponding data allowance. Postpaid plans, on the other hand, involve paying a monthly bill based on data usage and other services consumed.", "normalised": "Data plans, at their core, are packages offered by telecom operators like Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea that provide subscribers with a pre-defined amount of data usage (measured in megabytes or gigabytes) for a specific validity period, typically ranging from twenty eight days to a year.

{"unnormalised": "Factors influencing the choice of data plans are numerous. Data consumption habits, network availability in the user's location, and budget constraints are key considerations. For instance, a student in Delhi using online learning resources will have significantly different data requirements compared to a senior citizen in a rural village in Rajasthan who primarily uses data for messaging and occasional video calls. Telecom operators often offer segmented plans catering to specific user profiles, ranging from basic plans with limited data for social media access to premium plans with unlimited data and bundled OTT (Over-The-Top) services.", "normalised": "Factors influencing the choice of data plans are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the data allowance, other factors to consider include data speed (measured in Mbps), data rollover benefits (allowing unused data to be carried forward to the next billing cycle), and bundled benefits like free calls and SMS. The recent introduction of 5G technology has further complicated the landscape, with operators offering premium 5G data plans at a higher price point. Many are lured by advertisements promising speeds of up to 1 Gbps but realistically, the average user near say, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, is unlikely to consistently experience those rates due to network congestion and coverage limitations.", "normalised": "Beyond the data allowance, other factors to consider include data speed (measured in megabits per second), data rollover benefits (allowing unused data to be carried forward to the next billing cycle), and bundled benefits like free calls and S M S.

{"unnormalised": "Data usage surges during festivals like Diwali and Onam, as people share photos, videos, and greetings with loved ones. Many families celebrating with a virtual biryani cooking session during this time of social distancing also rely heavily on mobile data. Thus, users should actively monitor their data consumption and opt for a plan that adequately caters to their needs, especially during peak periods. In conclusion, navigating the intricate world of Indian data plans requires careful consideration of individual needs and a thorough understanding of the offerings available in the market.", "normalised": "Data usage surges during festivals like Diwali and Onam, as people share photos, videos, and greetings with loved ones.
