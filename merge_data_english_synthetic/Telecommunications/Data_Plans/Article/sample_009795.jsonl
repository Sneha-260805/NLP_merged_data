{"unnormalised": "Data plans are typically structured around three core elements: data allowance (measured in GB), validity period (ranging from a day to a year), and price (expressed in Rs.). Shorter validity plans, often called daily data plans, offer a fixed amount of data per day (e.g., 1.5GB/day) for a limited duration (e.g., 28 days). These are popular among users with consistent daily usage. Longer validity plans, on the other hand, provide a larger lump sum of data upfront (e.g., 50GB for 84 days). These cater to users who prefer flexibility in their data consumption.", "normalised": "Data plans are typically structured around three core elements: data allowance, measured in G B, validity period, ranging from a day to a year, and price, expressed in rupees. Shorter validity plans, often called daily data plans, offer a fixed amount of data per day, for example, one point five G B per day, for a limited duration, for example, twenty eight days. These are popular among users with consistent daily usage. Longer validity plans, on the other hand, provide a larger lump sum of data upfront, for example, fifty G B for eighty four days. These cater to users who prefer flexibility in their data consumption."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, many plans bundle additional benefits. These can include unlimited voice calls (local and STD), free SMS messages, and subscriptions to streaming services like JioCinema or Airtel Xstream. Some plans also offer data rollover, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle, a feature particularly useful for moderate data users.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, many plans bundle additional benefits.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding data speed limitations is also vital. While telecom companies often advertise “4G” or “5G” speeds, the actual speed experienced by the user can vary depending on factors like network congestion, device capabilities, and location (e.g., a rural area 200 km from Bangalore might have weaker signal). Some plans also throttle data speeds after a certain usage threshold, a detail often buried in the fine print.", "normalised": "Understanding data speed limitations is also vital. While telecom companies often advertise \"four G\" or \"five G\" speeds, the actual speed experienced by the user can vary depending on factors like network congestion, device capabilities, and location, for example, a rural area two hundred kilometer from Bangalore might have weaker signal. Some plans also throttle data speeds after a certain usage threshold, a detail often buried in the fine print."}
{"unnormalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual usage patterns. Someone who primarily uses data for browsing social media and messaging apps might find a lower data allowance sufficient, while a heavy user who streams videos and downloads large files regularly will require a higher data cap. Consider the festive season too! During Onam, for instance, many families video call relatives overseas, increasing data consumption.", "normalised": "Choosing the right data plan requires careful consideration of individual usage patterns.

Pay attention to details like data speeds, validity periods, and any hidden charges or limitations. Just as one carefully selects the best biryani recipe, selecting the optimal data plan requires thorough evaluation.
