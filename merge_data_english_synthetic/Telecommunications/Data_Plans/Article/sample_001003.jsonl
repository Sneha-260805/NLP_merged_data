{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic Indian telecommunications market, data plans are the backbone of connectivity, enabling everything from video calls to online shopping. Understanding the nuances of these plans is crucial for consumers and businesses alike. These plans dictate how much data you can consume within a specified period, typically 28 days, 56 days, or 84 days, impacting your online experience and budget.", "normalised": "In the dynamic Indian telecommunications market, data plans are the backbone of connectivity, enabling everything from video calls to online shopping.

{"unnormalised": "The amount of data you need depends heavily on your usage patterns. A student in Delhi streaming online lectures and attending virtual meetings might require a high-data plan (2GB/day or more), while a senior citizen in Chennai primarily using WhatsApp to connect with family may be satisfied with a lower data allowance. Remember to consider factors like video streaming quality (HD consumes more data) and the frequency of downloading large files.", "normalised": "The amount of data you need depends heavily on your usage patterns.

Remember to consider factors like video streaming quality (H D consumes more data) and the frequency of downloading large files."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the data allowance, several other factors influence the value of a data plan. Look for plans offering unlimited calling (local and STD), which are now standard. Consider the validity period: longer validity plans (e.g., 365 days) can be cost-effective for consistent users, even if the daily data limit is slightly lower.", "normalised": "Beyond the data allowance, several other factors influence the value of a data plan.

{"unnormalised": "Some plans bundle additional benefits like access to OTT platforms (Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video), music streaming services (Gaana, Spotify), or even insurance coverage. Reliance Jio, for instance, often bundles access to JioCinema and JioSaavn with its plans.

{"unnormalised": "Before choosing a data plan, it's wise to compare offerings from different providers. Use online comparison tools and read reviews from other users. Consider the network coverage in your area – even the best data plan is useless without reliable connectivity. A friend in Mumbai might have great experience with a certain provider, but the same provider may have weaker signal strength in, say, Kanpur.", "normalised": "Before choosing a data plan, it's wise to compare offerings from different providers.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, data caps and speed throttling are important considerations. Once you exhaust your daily or monthly data allowance, your internet speed will often be drastically reduced (throttled), making it difficult to browse the web or stream videos. Check the terms and conditions of your plan to understand the speed limits after exhausting your allocated data. Consider data add-ons if you anticipate exceeding your limit. Dr. Sharma, a telecom analyst at IIT Madras, suggests monitoring your data usage regularly using your operator's app to avoid unexpected charges or slowdowns.", "normalised": "Furthermore, data caps and speed throttling are important considerations.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, consider the environmental impact. Opting for longer validity plans can potentially reduce e-waste by minimizing SIM card replacements. Also, remember to dispose of old SIM cards responsibly. The telecommunications sector is continually evolving, with 5G technology promising even faster speeds and greater data capacity. As India progresses towards a fully digital economy, understanding and selecting the right data plan is paramount. A typical retail shop selling SIM cards might occupy an area of 100 sq ft.", "normalised": "Finally, consider the environmental impact.
