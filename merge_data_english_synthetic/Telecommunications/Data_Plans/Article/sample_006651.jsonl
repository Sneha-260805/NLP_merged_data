{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (daily, weekly, monthly, or annual), data allowance (measured in MB or GB), and included benefits such as unlimited calling, SMS bundles, and subscriptions to OTT platforms like Hotstar or JioCinema. Major telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) constantly revise their offerings to attract and retain customers, leading to a dynamic and often confusing marketplace.", "normalised": "Data plans in India are typically categorized based on validity (daily, weekly, monthly, or annual), data allowance (measured in megabytes or gigabytes), and included benefits such as unlimited calling, S M S bundles, and subscriptions to O T T platforms like Hotstar or JioCinema.

{"unnormalised": "One key factor to consider is the data speed promised versus the actual speed delivered. While operators advertise speeds up to 100 Mbps in urban areas, actual speeds often vary depending on network congestion, location, and device capabilities. Regularly checking speed using online tools or apps like Ookla's Speedtest can provide a realistic assessment of the data speeds you are experiencing.", "normalised": "One key factor to consider is the data speed promised versus the actual speed delivered. While operators advertise speeds up to one hundred megabits per second in urban areas, actual speeds often vary depending on network congestion, location, and device capabilities. Regularly checking speed using online tools or apps like Ookla's Speedtest can provide a realistic assessment of the data speeds you are experiencing."}
{"unnormalised": "Another important aspect is fair usage policy (FUP). Many \"unlimited\" data plans come with a FUP, which throttles the speed significantly after a certain data limit is reached. This can be frustrating for users who consume large amounts of data, particularly during festive seasons like Diwali or Onam, when families rely heavily on video calls and streaming services to connect with loved ones. For example, a monthly plan offering \"unlimited data\" might actually cap high-speed data at 2 GB per day, after which the speed drops to a paltry 64 Kbps.", "normalised": "Another important aspect is fair usage policy (F U P).

{"unnormalised": "The prevalence of data add-ons is also noteworthy. Users who exhaust their data allowance before the validity period expires can purchase additional data packs to continue accessing the internet. These packs often come in small denominations, such as 1 GB for Rs. 49 or 2 GB for Rs. 99, and can be a convenient solution for short-term needs. However, relying on data add-ons frequently can be more expensive than opting for a plan with a larger data allowance.", "normalised": "The prevalence of data add-ons is also noteworthy.

These packs often come in small denominations, such as one gigabyte for rupee forty nine or two gigabytes for rupee ninety nine, and can be a convenient solution for short-term needs. However, relying on data add-ons frequently can be more expensive than opting for a plan with a larger data allowance."}
{"unnormalised": "Moreover, regional variations in data plan pricing exist. In densely populated areas like Delhi NCR and Tamil Nadu, competition is fiercer, leading to lower prices and more generous data allowances compared to less connected regions in states like Bihar or Jharkhand. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) plays a crucial role in regulating the sector and ensuring fair pricing practices, although challenges remain in bridging the digital divide.", "normalised": "Moreover, regional variations in data plan pricing exist.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, choosing the right data plan requires careful evaluation of your individual needs and usage patterns. Consider your average monthly data consumption, desired speed, calling and SMS requirements, and the availability of network coverage in your area. Perhaps you love to indulge in a plate of delicious biryani while watching cricket online, then a plan with adequate data allowance is a must. Comparing plans from different operators and reading customer reviews can also help you make an informed decision and avoid bill shocks. Staying informed about the latest developments in the telecommunications landscape is key to navigating the complexities of data plans in India.", "normalised": "Ultimately, choosing the right data plan requires careful evaluation of your individual needs and usage patterns.
