{"unnormalised": "Data plans in India typically come in two broad categories: prepaid and postpaid. Prepaid plans, popular due to their flexibility and control over spending, dominate the market. Users recharge their accounts with a specific amount, which then allows them to access a pre-defined data allowance for a set validity period, often ranging from a single day to 365 days. For instance, a Jio plan might offer 2GB of data per day for 28 days at a price of Rs. 299. Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) offer competitive plans with similar data allowances and validity periods, sometimes bundling in additional benefits like unlimited calling and subscriptions to streaming services.", "normalised": "Data plans in India typically come in two broad categories: prepaid and postpaid. Prepaid plans, popular due to their flexibility and control over spending, dominate the market. Users recharge their accounts with a specific amount, which then allows them to access a pre-defined data allowance for a set validity period, often ranging from a single day to three hundred and sixty five days.

{"unnormalised": "Postpaid plans, on the other hand, offer a monthly billing cycle with a fixed data allowance. These plans often come with additional benefits such as higher data limits, family plans, and premium customer service. A typical postpaid plan from Airtel might offer 75GB of data per month, along with unlimited calling and Amazon Prime membership, for Rs. 499.", "normalised": "Postpaid plans, on the other hand, offer a monthly billing cycle with a fixed data allowance. These plans often come with additional benefits such as higher data limits, family plans, and premium customer service. A typical postpaid plan from Airtel might offer seventy five gigabytes of data per month, along with unlimited calling and Amazon Prime membership, for rupee four hundred and ninety nine."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several other factors influence the cost and value of a data plan. Data speeds, measured in Mbps (Megabits per second), are crucial for a smooth online experience. 4G LTE networks provide the backbone for most data plans, but the rollout of 5G is rapidly changing the landscape, offering significantly faster speeds in select cities. However, even with 4G, speeds can vary based on location, network congestion, and device capabilities.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic data allowance, several other factors influence the cost and value of a data plan.

Some providers offer complete data rollover, while others impose limitations.", "normalised": "Data rollover policies, allowing users to carry forward unused data to the next billing cycle, are another key consideration.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, many plans now offer data add-ons or boosters for users who exhaust their data allowance before the end of the validity period. These add-ons provide a quick and convenient way to replenish data without switching to a new plan. Think of it as needing an extra serving of biryani during Onam festivities – you just order another plate!", "normalised": "Furthermore, many plans now offer data add-ons or boosters for users who exhaust their data allowance before the end of the validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Consumers are advised to compare data plans from different providers carefully, considering their individual data usage patterns, speed requirements, and budget constraints. Checking network coverage maps for their area is also recommended, ensuring a reliable connection. Ultimately, choosing the right data plan in India is about finding the optimal balance between cost, data allowance, speed, and value-added services. With the right research, finding a data plan that suits your needs, whether you're streaming Bollywood movies or video conferencing with colleagues 2000 km away, becomes a much simpler task.", "normalised": "Consumers are advised to compare data plans from different providers carefully, considering their individual data usage patterns, speed requirements, and budget constraints.
