{"unnormalised": "The type of data plan a user needs depends heavily on their individual consumption patterns. For example, a college student in Delhi who spends hours streaming lectures and video calling friends would likely require a larger data allowance than a senior citizen in Kolkata who primarily uses their phone for occasional WhatsApp messages. Many operators offer tailored plans to cater to these varying needs. These range from small, budget-friendly options with minimal data to high-data plans with unlimited calling benefits often bundled in.", "normalised": "The type of data plan a user needs depends heavily on their individual consumption patterns.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing of data plans is a significant factor in India, a nation where affordability is paramount. The entry of Reliance Jio on 05/09/2016 disrupted the market with incredibly cheap data, forcing competitors to lower their prices. Even now, Indian data plans remain comparatively inexpensive on a global scale. A typical 1 GB per day plan can cost anywhere from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 for a validity of 28 days, though promotional offers and long-term subscriptions often provide better value.", "normalised": "The pricing of data plans is a significant factor in India, a nation where affordability is paramount.

Companies are launching 5G-specific data plans to capitalize on the advanced technology, promising higher speeds and lower latency. These plans are typically more expensive than their 4G counterparts, reflecting the infrastructure investments required for 5G deployment. The rollout is continuing, with a target of nationwide coverage by, say, 31/12/2024. Users should carefully evaluate their 5G needs before opting for these plans at 14:00 hrs.
