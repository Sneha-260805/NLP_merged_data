{"unnormalised": "Data plans, in their essence, are subscriptions offered by telecom service providers like Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea, providing users with a predetermined amount of data (measured in GBs or TBs) for a specific validity period. These plans often bundle voice calls, SMS messages, and access to value-added services like music streaming or OTT platforms. The cost and features of these plans vary widely, catering to the diverse needs and consumption patterns of the Indian populace.", "normalised": "Data plans, in their essence, are subscriptions offered by telecom service providers like J I O, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea, providing users with a predetermined amount of data (measured in gigabytes or terabytes) for a specific validity period.

{"unnormalised": "The evolution of data plans in India has been remarkable. From the era of expensive pay-as-you-go data rates, which could drain a user's balance in minutes, we have transitioned to an era of affordable and competitive offerings. This shift was largely triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which disrupted the market with its aggressive pricing and data-centric approach. The other players, forced to adapt, launched their own competitive plans, ultimately benefiting the end consumer.", "normalised": "The evolution of data plans in India has been remarkable.

{"unnormalised": "Today, a vast array of data plans are available, ranging from daily data packs ideal for casual users to monthly or annual plans tailored for heavy internet users and professionals. Plans are often segmented based on data allowance (e.g., 1 GB per day, 2 GB per day), validity (28 days, 56 days, 84 days, 365 days), and bundled services. For example, a student in Delhi might opt for a plan offering 1.5 GB per day for 84 days, while a corporate executive in Mumbai might choose a plan with unlimited data and bundled access to productivity apps.", "normalised": "Today, a vast array of data plans are available, ranging from daily data packs ideal for casual users to monthly or annual plans tailored for heavy internet users and professionals.

{"unnormalised": "The consumption of data varies significantly across regions and demographics. Urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad witness higher data consumption compared to rural areas, primarily due to greater access to high-speed internet and higher smartphone penetration. However, initiatives like the BharatNet project, aimed at connecting rural India with high-speed broadband, are expected to bridge this digital divide. The project initially slated completion by 15/08/2022, has faced delays and is now expected to achieve most of its goals by end of 2024.", "normalised": "The consumption of data varies significantly across regions and demographics.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the demand for data is only expected to increase, driven by the growth of online video streaming, e-commerce, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Telecom operators will need to continue innovating and offering compelling data plans to stay ahead of the curve. Furthermore, the rollout of 5G technology will further revolutionize the data landscape, enabling faster speeds, lower latency, and new possibilities for applications across various sectors. It is projected that 5G subscriptions will surpass 500 million in India by 2027. A meeting is scheduled at the Department of Telecommunications at 09:00 hrs on 10/07/2024 to review the progress of 5G rollout in Tier-II cities.
