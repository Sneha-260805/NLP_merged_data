{"unnormalised": "The Indian data plan market is highly competitive, driven by a demand fuelled by rising smartphone penetration and increasing digital literacy, especially among younger generations. Plans typically offer a specified amount of data (e.g., 1 GB, 2 GB, 5 GB per day), bundled with voice calling minutes and SMS allowances. Validity periods range from daily plans to monthly, quarterly, and even annual offerings. Some plans cater to specific needs, such as those focused on unlimited data with speed throttling after a certain threshold, or those emphasizing night-time data usage.", "normalised": "The Indian data plan market is highly competitive, driven by a demand fuelled by rising smartphone penetration and increasing digital literacy, especially among younger generations.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing structure of data plans varies significantly depending on the TSP, the data allowance, and the validity period. In urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi, consumers have a wider range of options and often enjoy lower prices compared to rural areas. For instance, a 1.5 GB per day plan with a 28-day validity might cost around Rs. 249, but the same plan in a less populated region might be priced slightly higher, potentially due to infrastructure costs.", "normalised": "The pricing structure of data plans varies significantly depending on the T S P, the data allowance, and the validity period.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, data plans are often subject to Fair Usage Policy (FUP). This policy dictates that after a subscriber exhausts their allotted high-speed data, the internet speed is reduced considerably, typically to 64 kbps or 128 kbps. This is a common practice implemented by TSPs to manage network congestion and ensure fair access for all users.", "normalised": "Furthermore, data plans are often subject to Fair Usage Policy (F U P). This policy dictates that after a subscriber exhausts their allotted high-speed data, the internet speed is reduced considerably, typically to sixty four K B P S or one hundred and twenty eight K B P S. This is a common practice implemented by T S P s to manage network congestion and ensure fair access for all users."}
{"unnormalised": "Recent regulatory changes, such as those implemented by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), have played a crucial role in shaping the data plan landscape. For example, the TRAI’s directive on tariff transparency aims to ensure that TSPs clearly communicate the terms and conditions of their data plans to consumers, preventing misleading advertising and hidden charges. These directives went into effect on 01/01/2020.", "normalised": "Recent regulatory changes, such as those implemented by T R A I (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), have played a crucial role in shaping the data plan landscape.

{"unnormalised": "The introduction of 5G technology is expected to further revolutionize data plans in India. 5G plans, offering significantly faster speeds and lower latency, are being rolled out in phases across major cities like Chennai and Kolkata. These plans, although currently premium priced, are predicted to become more accessible by 15/08/2024 as the 5G infrastructure expands and competition intensifies. As of 09:00 hrs today, a limited number of 5G data plans are available for select users on a trial basis.", "normalised": "The introduction of five G technology is expected to further revolutionize data plans in India.
