{"unnormalised": "Firstly, pre-paid data plans remain the dominant choice for a large segment of the Indian population, particularly in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. These plans offer flexibility and control over spending. Typically, these plans range from Rs. 149 for 1GB of data per day for 28 days to Rs. 599 for 2GB per day for 84 days. Many operators, like Jio and Airtel, also bundle in free voice calls and SMS. One must be wary of the \"unlimited\" call claims, as they often have Fair Usage Policy (FUP) limitations.", "normalised": "Firstly, pre-paid data plans remain the dominant choice for a large segment of the Indian population, particularly in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

{"unnormalised": "Post-paid data plans, on the other hand, offer a fixed monthly data allowance and are often preferred by users with consistent data needs, such as professionals in Bangalore's IT sector or businesses operating in Delhi's commercial hubs. These plans often come with additional benefits like priority customer service and bundled OTT subscriptions (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.). A typical post-paid plan might cost Rs. 499 per month and offer 75GB of data. Exceeding the data limit usually incurs extra charges per GB, so monitoring usage is crucial.", "normalised": "Post-paid data plans, on the other hand, offer a fixed monthly data allowance and are often preferred by users with consistent data needs, such as professionals in Bangalore's I T sector or businesses operating in Delhi's commercial hubs.

For example, some operators offer specific plans for streaming video, allowing users to consume content on platforms like Hotstar and YouTube without depleting their main data allowance. There are also student-specific plans offering discounts, often requiring verification through an institution like IIT Madras.", "normalised": "Furthermore, special data plans catered towards specific applications have emerged.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the core data allowance, factors like network coverage and speed are critical considerations. While a plan might advertise 4G LTE speeds, actual performance can vary significantly depending on location and network congestion. Consumers in densely populated areas like Kolkata may experience slower speeds compared to users in less crowded regions. Therefore, checking user reviews and network coverage maps is advisable before committing to a specific plan.", "normalised": "Beyond the core data allowance, factors like network coverage and speed are critical considerations.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the increasing demand for high-speed internet has led to the rollout of 5G networks in select cities. While still in its early stages, 5G promises significantly faster speeds and lower latency. 5G data plans are currently more expensive than their 4G counterparts, but prices are expected to become more competitive as the technology becomes more widespread. Dr. Sharma, a leading telecom analyst from IIM Ahmedabad, predicts 5G penetration to reach 60% of urban areas within the next 5 years.", "normalised": "Moreover, the increasing demand for high-speed internet has led to the rollout of five G networks in select cities.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, many operators now offer bundled home broadband and mobile data plans, providing a cost-effective solution for families with multiple devices. These bundles often include a fiber optic connection to the home, offering speeds up to 100 Mbps, along with a mobile data plan for each family member. For example, a family in a 2000 sq ft apartment in Chennai might opt for a bundled plan that includes 150GB of home broadband data and 50GB of mobile data for each of the three family members. Understanding your data consumption habits and carefully comparing the available options are crucial steps in selecting the ideal data plan for your needs.", "normalised": "Finally, many operators now offer bundled home broadband and mobile data plans, providing a cost-effective solution for families with multiple devices. These bundles often include a fiber optic connection to the home, offering speeds up to one hundred M B P S, along with a mobile data plan for each family member. For example, a family in a two thousand square foot apartment in Chennai might opt for a bundled plan that includes one hundred and fifty gigabytes of home broadband data and fifty gigabytes of mobile data for each of the three family members.
