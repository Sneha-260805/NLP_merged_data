{"unnormalised": "One key aspect of the 5G deployment is the use of different spectrum bands. The lower bands provide wider coverage, while the higher bands offer higher speeds but with limited range. Operators are strategically deploying a mix of these bands to optimize network performance across varied geographical regions, from the bustling commercial districts of Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai to the agricultural fields of Punjab.", "normalised": "One key aspect of the five G deployment is the use of different spectrum bands.
