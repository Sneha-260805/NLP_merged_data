{"unnormalised": "The government's commitment to facilitating the 5G rollout is evident through initiatives like the spectrum auctions, which saw significant investment from telecom operators. These auctions, completed in July 2022, enabled companies to acquire the necessary bandwidth to deploy their 5G networks effectively. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has also been actively working on streamlining regulations and addressing challenges related to infrastructure deployment, such as right-of-way approvals for laying optical fiber cables. Thousands of kilometers of optical fiber are being laid across the country to support the increased bandwidth requirements of 5G networks.", "normalised": "The government's commitment to facilitating the five G rollout is evident through initiatives like the spectrum auctions, which saw significant investment from telecom operators.

{"unnormalised": "The initial phase of the 5G rollout has focused on providing enhanced mobile broadband services to consumers. Users in cities like Bengaluru and Chennai are experiencing significantly faster download and upload speeds compared to 4G. Furthermore, 5G is expected to enable new use cases like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, enhancing entertainment and education experiences. For example, students attending IIT Madras can now leverage 5G-powered AR/VR applications for interactive learning.", "normalised": "The initial phase of the five G rollout has focused on providing enhanced mobile broadband services to consumers.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain in the broader 5G rollout. The high cost of 5G handsets is a barrier for many consumers. The availability of 5G infrastructure in rural areas is still limited. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure equitable access to the benefits of 5G technology across the country. A meeting is scheduled at Sanchar Bhawan at 09:00 hrs on 26/01/2024 to discuss strategies for accelerating rural 5G deployment. However, with continued investment, proactive government policies, and technological advancements, India is poised to harness the full potential of 5G and unlock a new era of digital transformation. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has also stipulated that by 31/12/2024, all villages with a population greater than 1000 should have 5G coverage. This involves significant investment, estimated to be upwards of Rs. 3,00,000 crore.", "normalised": "Challenges remain in the broader five G rollout.
