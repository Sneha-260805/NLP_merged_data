{"unnormalised": "One of the early challenges involved securing sufficient spectrum. The auction conducted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) saw enthusiastic participation, with Reliance Jio acquiring a substantial portion of the available spectrum, enabling them to offer wider coverage. Subsequent policy interventions by the government, including reduced spectrum usage charges, have further incentivized faster network deployment.", "normalised": "One of the early challenges involved securing sufficient spectrum.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of 5G extend beyond just faster download speeds. Its low latency and high bandwidth capabilities are crucial for applications like IoT (Internet of Things), enabling smart city initiatives, autonomous vehicles (though still in nascent stages in India), and enhanced industrial automation. Imagine a manufacturing plant in Gurugram, utilizing 5G-enabled sensors to monitor equipment performance in real-time, preventing costly breakdowns.", "normalised": "The benefits of five G extend beyond just faster download speeds.

{"unnormalised": "However, the nationwide 5G rollout is not without its complexities. Fiberization of cell towers remains a crucial bottleneck. A large percentage of towers still rely on microwave backhaul, which cannot fully support the data throughput of 5G. This necessitates significant investment in laying fiber optic cables, especially in rural areas. Companies like Sterlite Technologies Ltd. are actively involved in addressing this infrastructure gap.", "normalised": "However, the nationwide five G rollout is not without its complexities.

While smartphone manufacturers are increasingly launching 5G-compatible models, the price points need to become more accessible to the average Indian consumer. Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a professor at IIT Delhi, noted that local manufacturing incentives and collaborations with chipset makers could help drive down costs.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the availability of affordable five G-enabled devices is another important factor.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the expansion of 5G coverage to smaller towns and villages is the next critical step. The government's BharatNet project, aiming to connect rural areas with high-speed internet, will play a vital role in enabling this. The initial investment is considerable; estimates suggest the cost of a tower in a Tier-3 city can be Rs. 50 lakhs, excluding the land which can cost a further Rs. 20 lakhs, for approximately 1500 sq ft.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the expansion of five G coverage to smaller towns and villages is the next critical step.
