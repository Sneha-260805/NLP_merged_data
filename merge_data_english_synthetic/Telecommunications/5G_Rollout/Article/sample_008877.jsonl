As of Q3 2023, both operators have significantly expanded their 5G coverage, reaching a substantial portion of urban areas. Jio, for instance, claims to have covered nearly 90% of India with its 'True 5G' network. Airtel, on the other hand, is deploying 5G Plus, focusing on optimizing existing infrastructure for enhanced performance.", "normalised": "The initial phase, spearheaded by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, commenced in late two thousand and twenty two, initially targeting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "However, the rollout hasn't been without its challenges. Network infrastructure development requires significant investment. While the government has allocated spectrum bands and streamlined regulatory processes, the cost of deploying base stations and upgrading existing infrastructure remains a hurdle, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Moreover, the affordability of 5G-enabled devices poses another challenge. While smartphone manufacturers are increasingly offering affordable 5G handsets, a significant portion of the Indian population still relies on 4G or even 3G devices.", "normalised": "However, the rollout hasn't been without its challenges.
