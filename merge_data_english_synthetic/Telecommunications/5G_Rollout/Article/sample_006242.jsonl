{"unnormalised": "One of the primary drivers behind the rapid 5G deployment is the increased availability of spectrum. The government's successful spectrum auction in July 2022, which garnered Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, played a crucial role. This auction provided telecom operators with the necessary bandwidth in various frequency bands, including the critical 3.3-3.6 GHz band, to establish robust 5G networks.", "normalised": "One of the primary drivers behind the rapid five G deployment is the increased availability of spectrum. The government's successful spectrum auction in July two thousand and twenty two, which garnered rupee one point five lakh crore, played a crucial role. This auction provided telecom operators with the necessary bandwidth in various frequency bands, including the critical three point three to three point six G H Z band, to establish robust five G networks."}
{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G is already being felt in several areas. For instance, remote healthcare consultations are becoming more accessible, particularly in rural areas where access to specialists is limited. Agriculture is benefiting from IoT-enabled solutions, allowing farmers like Mr. Sharma in Haryana to monitor soil conditions, optimize irrigation, and improve crop yields using real-time data transmitted over the 5G network. Manufacturing is also witnessing a shift towards automation, with 5G facilitating seamless communication between machines and enabling real-time monitoring of production processes.", "normalised": "The impact of five G is already being felt in several areas.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The high cost of 5G-enabled devices is a barrier for many consumers, particularly in price-sensitive markets. Furthermore, the deployment of infrastructure, including the installation of cell towers and fiber optic cables, requires significant investment and faces logistical hurdles, especially in densely populated areas and remote regions. Imagine deploying a tower in the heart of Chandni Chowk - a logistical nightmare!", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of 5G in India is promising. The government's BharatNet project, aimed at connecting villages across the country with high-speed internet, will further accelerate 5G adoption. As the network expands and becomes more accessible, it will unlock new opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and social development. For instance, the ability to monitor vast tracts of land – say, a 10,000 sq ft tea estate in Assam – with minimal latency, will drive productivity gains. 5G truly has the potential to empower a digitally connected India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of five G in India is promising.
