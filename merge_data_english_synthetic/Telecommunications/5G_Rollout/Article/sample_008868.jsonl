{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. One significant hurdle is the availability of adequate fiber optic infrastructure, essential for backhauling the massive amounts of data generated by 5G networks. Expanding fiber connectivity, particularly in rural areas, requires significant investment and coordination between various stakeholders. Furthermore, affordability remains a concern for many consumers. While telecom operators are offering a range of 5G plans, the cost of 5G-enabled devices is still a barrier for a large segment of the population.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G extends beyond just faster internet speeds. It is expected to enable a wide range of applications, including smart cities, remote healthcare monitoring, precision agriculture, and autonomous vehicles. Imagine a farmer in Punjab using real-time data from sensors in his fields to optimize irrigation and fertilizer application, or a surgeon in AIIMS Delhi performing remote surgery using robotic arms controlled over a 5G network. These are just a few examples of the transformative potential of 5G.", "normalised": "The impact of five G extends beyond just faster internet speeds.
