{"unnormalised": "Initially, the rollout focused on key metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune. Airtel's 5G Plus service, for instance, leveraged its existing mid-band spectrum, offering a relatively faster transition for consumers already using 4G. Jio, on the other hand, touted its standalone 5G architecture, promising even greater bandwidth and lower latency, especially crucial for demanding applications like IoT and industrial automation.", "normalised": "Initially, the rollout focused on key metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune.

Imagine Dr. Sharma, a surgeon in AIIMS Delhi, performing remote surgery on a patient in a rural clinic in Bihar, leveraging the near-instantaneous connectivity of 5G. Or consider the farmers in Punjab utilizing 5G-enabled sensors to optimize irrigation and fertilizer usage, leading to higher yields and reduced costs.", "normalised": "The impact of five G extends far beyond enhanced smartphone usage.

{"unnormalised": "The government’s support has been instrumental in facilitating the 5G rollout. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allocated spectrum in various bands to different operators through auctions, generating revenue of over Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. Initiatives like the BharatNet project, aiming to connect villages across India with high-speed internet, are further complemented by 5G’s capabilities, potentially bridging the digital divide.", "normalised": "The government’s support has been instrumental in facilitating the five G rollout.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The cost of 5G infrastructure is substantial, requiring significant investments in network upgrades and new base stations. The availability of affordable 5G-enabled devices is also a crucial factor. While prices are gradually decreasing, making 5G phones accessible to a wider segment of the population is essential for realizing the full potential of the technology.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the continued expansion of 5G coverage across both urban and rural areas is paramount. We can anticipate smart city initiatives, advanced manufacturing processes, and a flourishing ecosystem of 5G-enabled applications. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in hubs like Surat, known for its textile industry occupying vast industrial areas of several thousand sq ft, can benefit immensely from automated processes and real-time data analytics powered by 5G. The future of Indian telecommunications is undoubtedly intertwined with the successful and widespread adoption of 5G technology. The next phase of rollout will focus on tier-2 and tier-3 cities, bringing the power of 5G to even more Indians.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the continued expansion of five G coverage across both urban and rural areas is paramount.
