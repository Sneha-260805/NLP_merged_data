{"unnormalised": "The initial 5G spectrum auctions, held in July 2022, saw the government rake in over Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. These auctions paved the way for the operators to acquire the necessary spectrum bands for deploying their 5G networks.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key use cases for 5G in India is in agriculture. Imagine farmers in Punjab using real-time data from sensors, transmitted over 5G, to optimize irrigation and fertilizer application, leading to increased yields and reduced waste. 5G-enabled remote healthcare solutions can also bridge the gap in access to quality medical care, particularly in underserved regions like the Northeast. For example, teleconsultations and remote surgeries, previously limited by bandwidth constraints, are becoming increasingly viable with 5G.", "normalised": "One of the key use cases for five G in India is in agriculture.

The expected launch of 5G services in Tier-II cities by 09:00 hrs on 26/01/2023 marks a significant milestone. Furthermore, the development of innovative applications and services tailored to the Indian market will be crucial for realizing the full potential of 5G. The government expects that by 2025, 5G will contribute significantly to India's GDP, boosting economic growth and creating new employment opportunities. The planned expansion covers approximately 20,000 km of fiber optic cables.
