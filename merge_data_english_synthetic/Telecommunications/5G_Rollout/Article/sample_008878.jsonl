{"unnormalised": "Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, the two leading telecom operators, spearheaded the initial phase of the 5G rollout, launching services in key metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai in late 2022. Since then, the expansion has been aggressive, with plans to cover all major cities and towns by the end of 2024. Vodafone Idea (Vi) is also ramping up its 5G infrastructure, albeit at a slightly slower pace, aiming for a comprehensive nationwide deployment in the near future.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, the two leading telecom operators, spearheaded the initial phase of the five G rollout, launching services in key metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai in late two thousand and twenty two.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has actively facilitated this rollout through policy initiatives and spectrum auctions. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) successfully auctioned 5G spectrum worth over Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, enabling telecom operators to acquire the necessary resources for deploying 5G networks. Furthermore, initiatives like the 'Gati Shakti Sanchar Portal' aim to streamline right-of-way approvals, reducing the time and cost associated with laying optical fiber and setting up mobile towers.", "normalised": "The Indian government has actively facilitated this rollout through policy initiatives and spectrum auctions.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Ensuring affordable access to 5G-enabled devices is crucial for widespread adoption. The cost of upgrading existing infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, is also a significant hurdle. Building a robust network requires substantial investments in optical fiber, with estimates suggesting that India needs to lay several million kilometers of fiber cable to fully support 5G. Moreover, the availability of suitable land for installing base stations, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Mumbai, poses logistical challenges. Erecting a single tower often requires securing 1000 sq ft of land, a considerable constraint. Despite these challenges, the 5G rollout in India is undeniably a transformative event, promising to unlock new economic opportunities and improve the lives of millions of Indians, echoing the technological leap that followed the Green Revolution in the agricultural sector.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
