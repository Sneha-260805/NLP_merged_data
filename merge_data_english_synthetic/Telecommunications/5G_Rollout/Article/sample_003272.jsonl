{"unnormalised": "The rollout of 5G technology across India represents a monumental leap forward for the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure. Following successful spectrum auctions in July 2022, major telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively deploying 5G networks, promising significantly enhanced speeds, lower latency, and greater network capacity. This transition is not merely an upgrade; it's a transformation poised to revolutionize various sectors of the Indian economy, from agriculture to healthcare, and manufacturing to entertainment.", "normalised": "The rollout of five G technology across India represents a monumental leap forward for the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Reliance Jio, spearheaded by Mukesh Ambani, has committed to covering the entire country by December 2023. Their “True 5G” network utilizes standalone 5G architecture, which allows for more efficient utilization of the spectrum and improved performance compared to non-standalone (NSA) implementations. Bharti Airtel, led by Sunil Mittal, is also rapidly expanding its 5G footprint, focusing on densely populated urban centers initially before expanding to rural areas. They have partnered with companies like Ericsson and Nokia for network deployment, highlighting the global collaboration driving India’s 5G ambition. Vodafone Idea (Vi), while facing financial challenges, is also working on its 5G deployment plans.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio, spearheaded by Mukesh Ambani, has committed to covering the entire country by December two thousand and twenty three.

{"unnormalised": "The initial phase of the rollout has concentrated on major metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Users in these cities are already experiencing download speeds significantly higher than those offered by 4G, often exceeding 500 Mbps. This allows for seamless streaming of high-definition video, lag-free online gaming, and faster downloads of large files. The lower latency is particularly crucial for applications like remote surgery and autonomous vehicles.", "normalised": "The initial phase of the rollout has concentrated on major metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G extends beyond consumer benefits. In agriculture, for example, precision farming techniques utilizing drones and sensors connected through 5G networks can optimize resource utilization and improve crop yields. In healthcare, remote consultations and surgeries, powered by reliable and high-speed 5G connectivity, can extend access to quality medical care to remote rural areas like those in Rajasthan. Industrial automation will also see a significant boost, with 5G enabling real-time monitoring and control of machines and processes.", "normalised": "The impact of five G extends beyond consumer benefits.

{"unnormalised": "However, the rollout is not without its challenges. The cost of 5G handsets remains a barrier for many users, although prices are gradually declining. The availability of adequate fiber backhaul infrastructure is also crucial for supporting the high bandwidth demands of 5G. Furthermore, concerns regarding the impact of 5G radiation on health persist in some segments of the population, despite scientific evidence indicating that 5G is safe within regulatory limits. Regulatory bodies like TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) are actively involved in monitoring the rollout and ensuring compliance with safety standards. A key meeting on spectrum allocation is scheduled for 10:00 hrs on 26/01/2024.", "normalised": "However, the rollout is not without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the widespread adoption of 5G is expected to contribute significantly to India's economic growth. The government's \"Digital India\" initiative, launched on 15/08/2015, aligns perfectly with the 5G rollout, aiming to empower citizens through technology. The implementation of 5G SA network and increased local manufacturing of telecom equipment, as highlighted in the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, are crucial steps in ensuring the long-term success of India's 5G journey. By 2025, projections suggest that 5G will contribute billions of Rs. to India's GDP, transforming the nation into a global digital powerhouse. A preliminary report is due by 31/03/2024 detailing the first year's impact of the 5G rollout. The expansion to smaller towns and villages is planned to commence after the successful completion of Phase 1 in the metros. Over 100,000 km of optical fiber cable is being laid to support this expansion.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the widespread adoption of five G is expected to contribute significantly to India's economic growth.
