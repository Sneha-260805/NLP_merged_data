{"unnormalised": "Consider the potential impact on smart cities. Imagine seamless integration of traffic management systems, optimized energy grids, and enhanced public safety measures, all powered by the low latency and high bandwidth of 5G networks. In healthcare, remote diagnostics and telesurgery, once considered futuristic concepts, are now becoming a tangible reality. Dr. Sharma, a leading cardiologist at AIIMS Delhi, emphasizes that 5G enables real-time monitoring of patients’ vital signs, irrespective of their location, potentially saving countless lives in rural areas with limited access to specialized medical care.", "normalised": "Consider the potential impact on smart cities.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact is equally significant. A recent study by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that 5G could add Rs. 3.6 trillion to India’s GDP by 2028. This growth will be fueled by increased productivity, innovation, and the creation of new business models. The expansion of 5G infrastructure is also creating numerous job opportunities, particularly in the areas of network engineering, software development, and cybersecurity.", "normalised": "The economic impact is equally significant.

{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout is not without its challenges. One major hurdle is the high cost of deployment, particularly in densely populated urban areas where the need for small cells is paramount to ensure adequate coverage. Acquiring suitable sites for these small cells can be a time-consuming and expensive process, especially in congested cities like Mumbai where real estate prices are exorbitant, sometimes exceeding Rs. 5,000 per sq ft.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout is not without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another challenge is the limited availability of indigenous 5G equipment. While the Indian government is actively promoting \"Make in India\" initiatives to encourage domestic manufacturing of telecom equipment, significant investments in research and development are needed to achieve self-reliance. Furthermore, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with the increased connectivity and data transfer enabled by 5G networks.", "normalised": "Another challenge is the limited availability of indigenous five G equipment.
