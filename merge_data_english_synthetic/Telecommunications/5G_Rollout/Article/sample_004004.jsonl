{"unnormalised": "The government is actively addressing these challenges through initiatives like the BharatNet project, aimed at connecting rural areas with high-speed broadband. Further spectrum auctions are planned to provide operators with the resources needed to expand their 5G networks. The long-term economic impact of 5G is projected to be substantial, contributing significantly to India's digital economy. Preliminary estimates suggest that 5G deployment could add Rs. 3.6 trillion to the Indian economy by 2040.", "normalised": "The government is actively addressing these challenges through initiatives like the BharatNet project, aimed at connecting rural areas with high-speed broadband.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the focus is shifting towards leveraging 5G for specific use cases. Smart city initiatives, industrial automation, and enhanced agricultural practices are all areas where 5G can play a pivotal role. For example, precision agriculture techniques utilizing 5G-connected sensors and drones can help farmers optimize crop yields and reduce resource consumption. Even small businesses, like textile manufacturers in Surat operating in spaces as small as 500 sq ft, are exploring 5G-enabled solutions for improving efficiency and productivity. The success of 5G in India hinges on collaborative efforts between the government, telecom operators, and various industry stakeholders to unlock its full potential and transform the nation into a digitally empowered society.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the focus is shifting towards leveraging five G for specific use cases.
