{"unnormalised": "The initial phase of the rollout focused on metropolitan areas and Tier-I cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. These cities are now experiencing peak download speeds reaching several Gbps, significantly exceeding the capabilities of 4G networks. Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a leading telecommunications expert at IIT Bombay, noted that \"the deployment of 5G is not merely an upgrade, but a fundamental shift in how we utilize and interact with technology, unlocking new possibilities for IoT, AI, and edge computing.\"", "normalised": "The initial phase of the rollout focused on metropolitan areas and Tier-one cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.
