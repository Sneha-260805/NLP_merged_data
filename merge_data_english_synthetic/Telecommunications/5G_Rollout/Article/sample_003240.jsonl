{"unnormalised": "The initial phase of the rollout began in select cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, with plans to expand coverage nationwide in a phased manner. By December 2024, a large percentage of India is expected to have access to 5G services. This ambitious timeline is fueled by substantial investments from telecom companies, coupled with government initiatives to promote digital connectivity and reduce the digital divide. For example, the BharatNet project aims to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed internet.", "normalised": "The initial phase of the rollout began in select cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, with plans to expand coverage nationwide in a phased manner.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond consumer applications, 5G is poised to revolutionize various sectors of the Indian economy. In manufacturing, it can enable smart factories with connected sensors and robots, improving efficiency and productivity. In healthcare, remote diagnostics and telemedicine become more accessible, particularly in rural areas. In agriculture, precision farming techniques can be implemented using data collected by 5G-enabled sensors, optimizing resource utilization and crop yields. A key pilot project took place on 26/01/2023 in Punjab to demonstrate this.", "normalised": "Beyond consumer applications, five G is poised to revolutionize various sectors of the Indian economy.

The high cost of spectrum, infrastructure upgrades, and device affordability are significant hurdles that need to be addressed. The government is playing a crucial role in facilitating the rollout by streamlining regulations, offering incentives, and promoting indigenous manufacturing of telecom equipment. It is also important to note that rural areas face unique difficulties such as limited fiber connectivity and power supply issues. The \"Digital India\" campaign initiated on 15/08/1947 envisioned this transformation.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout in India is not without its challenges.
