{"unnormalised": "Leading telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively expanding their 5G networks. Jio, for instance, aims to cover the entire country by December 2023, while Airtel has been focusing on key urban and rural areas. Initial rollout started in metros like Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. This phased approach allows operators to optimize infrastructure development and address regional variations in network requirements. The sheer scale of this undertaking involves laying thousands of kilometers of fiber optic cable and installing numerous base stations across the country.", "normalised": "leading telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks.

{"unnormalised": "The potential impact of 5G extends far beyond faster downloads. Industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture stand to benefit immensely. In manufacturing, 5G-enabled automation can improve efficiency and reduce downtime. In healthcare, remote diagnostics and telemedicine become more accessible, especially in rural areas where access to specialized medical professionals is limited. Imagine a village in Rajasthan benefiting from a specialist consultation facilitated by a high-speed, low-latency 5G connection. Even agriculture can see advancements with precision farming, leveraging real-time data analysis for optimized crop yields.", "normalised": "the potential impact of five G extends far beyond faster downloads. industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture stand to benefit immensely. in manufacturing, five G enabled automation can improve efficiency and reduce downtime. in healthcare, remote diagnostics and telemedicine become more accessible, especially in rural areas where access to specialized medical professionals is limited. imagine a village in Rajasthan benefiting from a specialist consultation facilitated by a high speed, low latency five G connection. even agriculture can see advancements with precision farming, leveraging real time data analysis for optimized crop yields."}
{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout isn't without its challenges. Spectrum availability and affordability remain key concerns. The initial auction of 5G spectrum witnessed intense bidding, with operators investing substantial amounts (Rs. 1.5 lakh crore approx.) to secure the necessary bandwidth. Infrastructure development also presents logistical hurdles, especially in densely populated urban areas and geographically challenging terrains. The deployment of small cells to improve network coverage in areas with dense building construction (like Connaught Place in Delhi with its colonial-era structures and limited open spaces) requires careful planning and execution. Obtaining necessary permissions for installing towers and laying cables can also be a time-consuming process. Land acquisition, particularly in congested urban areas, can drive up costs significantly, sometimes exceeding Rs. 500 per sq ft for strategic locations.", "normalised": "however, the five G rollout isn't without its challenges. spectrum availability and affordability remain key concerns. the initial auction of five G spectrum witnessed intense bidding, with operators investing substantial amounts (rupees one point five lakh crore approximately) to secure the necessary bandwidth. infrastructure development also presents logistical hurdles, especially in densely populated urban areas and geographically challenging terrains. the deployment of small cells to improve network coverage in areas with dense building construction (like Connaught Place in Delhi with its colonial era structures and limited open spaces) requires careful planning and execution. obtaining necessary permissions for installing towers and laying cables can also be a time consuming process. land acquisition, particularly in congested urban areas, can drive up costs significantly, sometimes exceeding rupees five hundred per square foot for strategic locations."}
