{"unnormalised": "The benefits of 5G are already becoming apparent. Download speeds have increased dramatically, with users experiencing speeds several times faster than 4G. This enhanced connectivity is enabling new applications, such as immersive virtual reality experiences, real-time remote surgery (supported by institutions like AIIMS), and advanced industrial automation. Consider, for instance, the potential for remote diagnostics in rural areas like Rajasthan, or precision agriculture techniques leveraging IoT devices across vast swathes of land in Punjab.", "normalised": "The benefits of five G are already becoming apparent.

{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout has also presented certain challenges. One significant hurdle is the high cost of infrastructure development, including the deployment of new towers and the upgrading of existing infrastructure. The government has been actively working to address this issue, offering incentives and streamlining regulatory processes to encourage investment. The auction of 5G spectrum generated substantial revenue for the government, but the high reserve prices were a concern for some telecom operators.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout has also presented certain challenges.
