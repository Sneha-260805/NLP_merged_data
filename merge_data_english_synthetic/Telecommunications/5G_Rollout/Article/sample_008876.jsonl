With improved network infrastructure, remote villages in states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh can now access quality education and healthcare services via telemedicine and e-learning platforms. Farmers are also benefiting from precision agriculture techniques enabled by real-time data analysis through 5G-connected sensors. Imagine a farmer in Punjab using a 5G enabled drone to monitor his fields spread across several acres in real-time!", "normalised": "One of the most significant benefits of five G is its impact on rural connectivity.
