{"unnormalised": "The initial phases of 5G deployment focused on major metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. As of Q3 2024, coverage has expanded significantly, reaching Tier-II cities like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Coimbatore. Both Jio and Airtel are employing a mix of Non-Standalone (NSA) and Standalone (SA) architectures, with a gradual shift towards SA for enhanced network capabilities. Jio's approach, leveraging its 700 MHz spectrum acquisition, promises wider coverage, particularly in rural areas. Airtel, on the other hand, is focusing on leveraging existing infrastructure and dynamic spectrum sharing for faster deployment in urban centres.", "normalised": "The initial phases of five G deployment focused on major metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. As of Q three two thousand and twenty four, coverage has expanded significantly, reaching Tier two cities like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Coimbatore. Both Jio and Airtel are employing a mix of Non-Standalone (N S A) and Standalone (S A) architectures, with a gradual shift towards S A for enhanced network capabilities.

{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout hasn't been without its hurdles. High spectrum costs, particularly for the millimetre wave bands, have been a concern for telecom operators. The cost of infrastructure upgrades, including the deployment of new base stations and fibre optic cables, is substantial. Government initiatives like the Gati Shakti National Master Plan are aimed at streamlining infrastructure development and reducing bureaucratic bottlenecks. The need for skilled manpower to manage and maintain the 5G network is another pressing challenge. Institutions like the IITs and IIITs are playing a crucial role in developing 5G-ready talent.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout hasn't been without its hurdles.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G is expected to be far-reaching. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) will significantly improve the user experience with faster download speeds and lower latency, enabling applications like 4K video streaming and cloud gaming. Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) will connect a vast number of IoT devices, transforming industries like agriculture, manufacturing, and healthcare. For example, precision agriculture enabled by 5G-connected sensors can optimize irrigation and fertilizer usage, improving crop yields for farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) will facilitate critical applications like remote surgery and autonomous vehicles. Dr. Sharma, a renowned surgeon at AIIMS, believes 5G-enabled remote surgery can revolutionize healthcare access in remote areas of India.", "normalised": "The impact of five G is expected to be far-reaching.
