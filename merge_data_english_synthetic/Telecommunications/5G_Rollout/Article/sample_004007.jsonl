{"unnormalised": "India's 5G rollout is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape, promising blazing-fast speeds, reduced latency, and a plethora of new applications impacting various sectors. The initial phase, commencing in October 2022, saw major players like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel aggressively deploying 5G infrastructure in key metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. Since then, the rollout has expanded to cover hundreds of cities and towns across the country, driven by the government's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a strong push for 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' in telecom manufacturing.", "normalised": "India's five G rollout is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape, promising blazing-fast speeds, reduced latency, and a plethora of new applications impacting various sectors.

{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout also presents certain challenges. The high cost of spectrum and infrastructure deployment requires significant investment. Telecom operators have already invested thousands of crores of Rs. in acquiring spectrum and building out their 5G networks. Furthermore, ensuring consistent 5G coverage across the vast and diverse Indian terrain remains a logistical hurdle. The deployment of small cells is crucial for densifying the network, especially in densely populated urban areas and indoor environments, such as shopping malls spanning thousands of sq ft.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout also presents certain challenges.
