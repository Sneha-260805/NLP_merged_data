{"unnormalised": "The initial phase focused on metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru. Subsequently, the rollout has extended to Tier-II and Tier-III cities, including Lucknow, Patna, and Jaipur. Reliance Jio plans to cover the entire country by December 2023, while Airtel aims for pan-India coverage by March 2024. This rapid expansion involves significant investments in infrastructure, including the installation of thousands of new cell towers and the upgrading of existing ones. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been instrumental in facilitating this process by streamlining approvals and promoting infrastructure sharing.", "normalised": "The initial phase focused on metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges is the availability of affordable 5G-enabled devices. While smartphone manufacturers are increasingly launching 5G-compatible models, the price point remains a barrier for many consumers. The government is actively encouraging local manufacturing to reduce costs and increase accessibility. Another challenge is ensuring adequate backhaul capacity to support the increased data traffic generated by 5G. Telecom operators are investing in fiber optic networks to address this bottleneck.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges is the availability of affordable five G-enabled devices.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G extends beyond faster internet speeds. It is expected to enable new applications such as smart agriculture, remote healthcare, and connected vehicles. Imagine farmers in Haryana using drones connected via 5G to monitor their crops and optimize irrigation, or doctors in AIIMS performing remote surgeries with near-zero latency. These scenarios are becoming increasingly feasible with the advent of 5G. The improved connectivity will also boost e-commerce and online education, benefiting millions of Indians in rural areas. We can also see increased bandwidth for live events streamed from, say, a sprawling wedding venue of 10,000 sq ft in Udaipur.", "normalised": "The impact of five G extends beyond faster internet speeds.
