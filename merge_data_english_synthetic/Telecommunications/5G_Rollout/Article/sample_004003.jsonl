{"unnormalised": "Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel were among the first to launch 5G services, with ambitious plans for nationwide coverage. Initial deployments focused on metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, gradually expanding to smaller cities and towns. As of Q3 2023, significant progress has been made, with both operators claiming substantial coverage in major urban centers. Vodafone Idea (Vi) has also subsequently joined the fray, albeit at a slightly slower pace, citing financial constraints.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel were among the first to launch 5 G services, with ambitious plans for nationwide coverage.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has been actively supporting the 5G rollout through policy initiatives and spectrum auctions. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has played a crucial role in streamlining regulatory processes and allocating spectrum to telecom operators. The auctions themselves generated substantial revenue for the government, amounting to several thousand Crores (Rs.) of rupees.", "normalised": "The Indian government has been actively supporting the 5 G rollout through policy initiatives and spectrum auctions.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, however. One significant hurdle is the availability of affordable 5G-enabled devices. While prices have been steadily decreasing, a large segment of the population still relies on 4G handsets. Furthermore, the deployment of robust fiber optic infrastructure, essential for supporting the high bandwidth demands of 5G, is still ongoing. Many rural areas in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lack adequate fiber connectivity. The cost of upgrading existing infrastructure and deploying new cell towers is also a substantial investment for telecom operators. Land acquisition for new tower sites, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Dharavi, Mumbai, presents its own set of complexities.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, however.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G is already being felt in sectors like healthcare. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, New Delhi, has highlighted the potential for remote surgeries and improved telemedicine capabilities. In agriculture, 5G-enabled sensors and drones are being used for precision farming, helping farmers in Punjab and Haryana optimize their crop yields. For example, a trial project in a 10,000 sq ft farm utilized 5G to monitor soil moisture and automate irrigation, leading to significant water savings.", "normalised": "The impact of 5 G is already being felt in sectors like healthcare.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the successful and equitable rollout of 5G across India will depend on continued collaboration between the government, telecom operators, and device manufacturers. Bridging the digital divide and ensuring that the benefits of 5G reach all sections of society, including remote villages and underserved communities, will be crucial. The vision of a truly connected and digitally empowered Bharat hinges on the effective and inclusive deployment of this transformative technology. The next few years will be critical in shaping the future of telecommunications in India.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the successful and equitable rollout of 5 G across India will depend on continued collaboration between the government, telecom operators, and device manufacturers.
