{"unnormalised": "The initial phases focused on metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Reliance Jio, chaired by Mukesh Ambani, has been aggressively pursuing its 5G rollout, aiming to cover the entire country by December 2023. They are utilizing Standalone (SA) 5G architecture, promising true 5G speeds and lower latency. Airtel, led by Sunil Mittal, has opted for Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G initially, leveraging existing 4G infrastructure for a quicker rollout, before transitioning to SA later.", "normalised": "The initial phases focused on metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has played a crucial role in facilitating the rollout, auctioning off spectrum in various bands, including the 700 MHz, 3.3 GHz, and 26 GHz bands. These auctions, which generated revenue of over Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, enabled telecom operators to acquire the necessary spectrum to deploy their 5G networks.", "normalised": "The Department of Telecommunications (D O T) has played a crucial role in facilitating the rollout, auctioning off spectrum in various bands, including the seven hundred M H Z, three point three G H Z, and twenty six G H Z bands. These auctions, which generated revenue of over rupee one point five lakh crore, enabled telecom operators to acquire the necessary spectrum to deploy their five G networks."}
{"unnormalised": "One of the significant challenges faced during the rollout has been the infrastructure requirements. Deploying a dense network of small cells, required for optimal 5G coverage, necessitates a vast number of sites, including rooftops and street furniture. Permissions from local municipal corporations, like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in Mumbai, can be time-consuming and complex. Further, right-of-way issues for laying optical fiber cables, crucial for backhauling data, present logistical hurdles.", "normalised": "One of the significant challenges faced during the rollout has been the infrastructure requirements.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of 5G extends beyond faster download speeds for consumers. It promises to revolutionize industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. In manufacturing, 5G-enabled automation and robotics can significantly improve efficiency and productivity. In healthcare, remote patient monitoring and telemedicine, facilitated by 5G’s low latency, can improve access to healthcare in remote areas like Rajasthan. Farmers in Punjab are already exploring the use of 5G-powered IoT devices for precision agriculture, optimizing irrigation and fertilizer usage.", "normalised": "The impact of five G extends beyond faster download speeds for consumers.
