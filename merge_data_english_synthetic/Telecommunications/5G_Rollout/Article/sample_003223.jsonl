{"unnormalised": "The government's proactive policies, including the reduction of spectrum usage charges and the streamlining of Right of Way (RoW) approvals, have played a crucial role in accelerating the 5G rollout. The 'Gati Shakti Sanchar' portal, launched on 13/10/2021, aims to facilitate faster infrastructure deployment by centralizing approvals for laying optical fiber cables and installing telecom towers. This is crucial for achieving widespread 5G coverage, especially in rural areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where connectivity remains a challenge.", "normalised": "The government's proactive policies, including the reduction of spectrum usage charges and the streamlining of Right of Way (R O W) approvals, have played a crucial role in accelerating the five G rollout.

{"unnormalised": "The implications of 5G extend far beyond faster mobile internet. In healthcare, 5G enables remote diagnostics and surgeries, bringing specialized medical care to underserved communities. In agriculture, it facilitates precision farming techniques, optimizing resource utilization and improving crop yields. Smart cities initiatives across India, such as those in Pune and Indore, will also benefit significantly from 5G-enabled technologies, including intelligent traffic management and enhanced public safety systems.", "normalised": "The implications of five G extend far beyond faster mobile internet.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, however. The cost of 5G smartphones and data plans poses a barrier to widespread adoption, particularly in price-sensitive markets. Furthermore, the availability of skilled manpower to manage and maintain the 5G infrastructure is a key concern. Ensuring seamless integration with existing 4G networks is also critical for providing a consistent user experience during the transition phase. According to TRAI’s estimates, the 5G rollout will necessitate an investment of approximately Rs. 3.6 lakh crore over the next few years.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, however.

{"unnormalised": "The government's \"Digital India\" campaign is heavily reliant on the success of 5G. The vision is to connect every village and empower citizens with access to information and opportunities. Reaching remote areas, like those in Arunachal Pradesh, requires careful planning and targeted investments to ensure equitable access to the benefits of 5G. The target set by the Department of Telecommunications is to have 5G coverage in at least 80% of the country by 31/03/2024. Industry analysts predict substantial gains in productivity by 2025, around 15:00 hrs, if these targets are met. The success of 5G depends on a collaborative effort between the government, telecom operators, and technology providers, working together to build a robust and inclusive digital ecosystem for India.", "normalised": "The government's \"Digital India\" campaign is heavily reliant on the success of five G.
