{"unnormalised": "The potential benefits of 5G are immense. Enhanced mobile broadband speeds will enable seamless streaming of high-definition video, immersive gaming experiences, and faster downloads. In the industrial sector, 5G will facilitate the adoption of technologies like IoT, AI, and automation, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. For example, the deployment of 5G-enabled smart sensors in agricultural fields in Punjab can optimize irrigation and fertilizer usage, boosting crop yields. Smart city initiatives, utilizing 5G for traffic management, public safety, and waste management, will enhance the quality of life for urban residents.", "normalised": "The potential benefits of five G are immense.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of 5G is projected to be substantial. A recent study by NASSCOM estimates that 5G could contribute over Rs. 1 trillion to the Indian economy by 2035. The growth of the digital economy, the creation of new jobs, and the attraction of foreign investment are all expected to be driven by the widespread adoption of 5G technology. The construction of a new data center spanning 10,000 sq ft near Hyderabad, fueled by 5G connectivity, exemplifies this potential. The success of the 5G rollout hinges on collaboration between the government, telecom operators, and other stakeholders to overcome the challenges and unlock its transformative potential for India.", "normalised": "The economic impact of five G is projected to be substantial.
