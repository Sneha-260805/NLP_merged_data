{"unnormalised": "The rollout of 5G services across India marks a pivotal moment in the nation's telecommunications landscape. Following extensive trials and spectrum auctions in 2022, spearheaded by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), major telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel began launching 5G services in select cities. This technological leap promises transformative changes for businesses, consumers, and the economy as a whole.", "normalised": "The rollout of five G services across India marks a pivotal moment in the nation's telecommunications landscape.

{"unnormalised": "Currently, the 5G rollout is progressing in a phased manner. Metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai were among the first to experience the enhanced speeds and lower latency offered by 5G. Airtel, for example, has been actively expanding its 5G Plus services, while Jio is deploying its True 5G network, built on a standalone (SA) architecture, offering a distinct advantage in terms of network performance. The initial response has been positive, with users experiencing significantly faster download speeds, sometimes exceeding 500 Mbps, compared to the existing 4G networks.", "normalised": "Currently, the five G rollout is progressing in a phased manner.

{"unnormalised": "The implications of 5G extend beyond faster internet speeds. Its ultra-low latency is crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and industrial automation. In agriculture, 5G-enabled sensors and drones can optimize farming practices, leading to increased yields and reduced resource consumption. Dr. Meena Sharma, a professor at IIT Delhi, believes that 5G will enable the development of smart cities with interconnected infrastructure, enhancing public safety and efficiency.", "normalised": "The implications of five G extend beyond faster internet speeds.

{"unnormalised": "However, the 5G rollout in India faces several challenges. The high cost of spectrum and infrastructure deployment presents a significant barrier for telecom operators. The availability of affordable 5G-enabled devices is also crucial for mass adoption. While smartphone manufacturers are releasing more 5G-compatible devices, the price point remains a concern for many consumers, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "However, the five G rollout in India faces several challenges.

{"unnormalised": "A recent study by CRISIL estimates that the total investment in 5G infrastructure could reach Rs. 3 lakh crore over the next few years. The telecom operators are investing heavily in deploying 5G base stations and upgrading their networks. The coverage of 5G is still limited to specific areas within cities, often covering a few sq ft at a time and gradually improving. As the rollout progresses, it is expected to reach tier-2 and tier-3 cities, connecting even the most remote corners of India. The government plans to cover over 80% of the country in the next 2-3 years. With continuous efforts from both the government and private sector, 5G is poised to unlock new opportunities and drive economic growth in India. The estimated fiberisation required is around 1.5 million km.", "normalised": "A recent study by C R I S I L estimates that the total investment in five G infrastructure could reach rupee three lakh crore over the next few years.
