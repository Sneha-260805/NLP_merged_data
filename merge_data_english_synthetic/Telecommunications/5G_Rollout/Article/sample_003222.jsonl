{"unnormalised": "Jio, led by Mukesh Ambani, has opted for a standalone (SA) 5G architecture, claiming it offers superior performance and lower latency. Airtel, under Sunil Mittal, initially focused on a non-standalone (NSA) architecture, leveraging its existing 4G infrastructure for a faster rollout. However, both are progressively expanding their SA 5G networks. The choice between SA and NSA ultimately impacts the types of applications and services that can be supported.", "normalised": "Jio, led by Mukesh Ambani, has opted for a standalone (S A) five G architecture, claiming it offers superior performance and lower latency.

{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the cost. 5G devices are still relatively expensive for the average Indian consumer, potentially creating a digital divide. Telecom operators are working on affordable 5G plans and partnerships with handset manufacturers to address this concern. Moreover, the availability of adequate backhaul infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, remains a crucial factor. Government initiatives like the BharatNet project aim to improve connectivity in these regions.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the cost. five G devices are still relatively expensive for the average Indian consumer, potentially creating a digital divide.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the true potential of 5G lies in its ability to enable transformative applications. From smart cities to connected vehicles, the possibilities are vast. A demonstration of 5G powered remote-controlled machinery at IIT Madras on 26/01/2023, highlighted its capabilities in industrial automation. However, realizing this potential requires collaboration between telecom operators, technology providers, and the government. Ensuring a secure and reliable 5G network is paramount, and cybersecurity concerns must be addressed proactively. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is actively working on developing robust security standards and protocols. As we approach the anniversary of India's independence on 15/08/2024, the progress of 5G rollout will be a key indicator of the nation's technological advancement. A stakeholder meeting is scheduled for 10:00 hrs on 05/07/2024 in Sanchar Bhawan to discuss the progress of the rollout and address any challenges.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the true potential of five G lies in its ability to enable transformative applications.
