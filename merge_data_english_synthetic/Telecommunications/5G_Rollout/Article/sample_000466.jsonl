{"unnormalised": "The initial rollout strategy has largely focused on metropolitan areas and Tier 1 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. Airtel launched its 5G Plus services in these cities, while Reliance Jio adopted a slightly different approach, offering its 5G services initially through an invitation-only ‘Jio Welcome Offer’. The aim is to progressively expand coverage to smaller towns and rural areas, bridging the digital divide and empowering communities across the nation.", "normalised": "The initial rollout strategy has largely focused on metropolitan areas and Tier one cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges in the 5G rollout has been the deployment of the necessary infrastructure, including towers and fiber optic cables. The Indian government has been actively working to streamline the process of acquiring Right of Way (RoW) permissions for laying fiber and installing cell towers, recognizing the importance of efficient infrastructure deployment for widespread 5G adoption. The estimated investment in 5G infrastructure over the next few years is projected to be substantial, potentially reaching Rs. 3-4 lakh crore.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges in the five G rollout has been the deployment of the necessary infrastructure, including towers and fiber optic cables.
