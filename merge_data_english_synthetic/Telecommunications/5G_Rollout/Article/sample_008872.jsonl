{"unnormalised": "Leading telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively expanding their 5G networks, deploying infrastructure across major cities and progressively extending coverage to smaller towns and rural areas. Jio's standalone 5G network and Airtel's non-standalone approach demonstrate different strategies in tackling the complexities of the Indian market. The initial phases have focused on metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, with subsequent expansion targeting Tier-II and Tier-III cities.", "normalised": "Leading telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks, deploying infrastructure across major cities and progressively extending coverage to smaller towns and rural areas.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major challenges has been the availability of spectrum. The Indian government's auction of 5G spectrum in 2022, which saw participation from Adani Data Networks alongside existing players, was a crucial step. However, the cost of spectrum and the capital expenditure required for infrastructure deployment remain significant hurdles. Companies are investing heavily in building cell towers and laying optical fiber cables to support the increased data traffic. A typical cell tower can cover an area ranging from a few hundred meters to several kilometers, depending on the terrain and population density.", "normalised": "One of the major challenges has been the availability of spectrum.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the government's support through policies and incentives is crucial to accelerating the 5G rollout. Rural connectivity initiatives and subsidies can help bridge the digital divide. Furthermore, collaboration between telecom operators, technology providers, and research institutions like IIT Madras is essential for innovation and developing solutions tailored to the Indian context. The vision is to create a truly connected India, where 5G empowers individuals and businesses alike, contributing to the nation's economic growth and development. The cost of setting up a small 5G-enabled office space of approximately 500 sq ft can vary significantly. Early adopters have seen ROI that justifies spending upto Rs. 20,000 on a high-end router.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the government's support through policies and incentives is crucial to accelerating the five G rollout.
