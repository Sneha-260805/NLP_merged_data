{"unnormalised": "The initial rollout focused on non-standalone (NSA) 5G, utilizing existing 4G infrastructure as an anchor. Now, the transition towards standalone (SA) 5G, leveraging dedicated 5G core networks, promises even greater performance and enhanced capabilities. This advancement is crucial for unlocking the full potential of 5G, enabling advanced applications such as ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC).", "normalised": "The initial rollout focused on non standalone (N S A) 5G, utilizing existing 4G infrastructure as an anchor.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The cost of 5G smartphones is still a barrier for many Indians, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure requires significant investment in fiber optic cables, base stations, and spectrum. The allocation of adequate spectrum bands at reasonable prices is crucial for ensuring widespread 5G coverage. The total cost of deploying 5G across India is estimated to be in the range of Rs. 3-4 lakh crore.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
