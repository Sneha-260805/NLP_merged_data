{"unnormalised": "One key area of focus is smart city development. 5G infrastructure is crucial for connecting sensors, enabling real-time data collection for traffic management, waste management, and public safety initiatives. Think of intelligent streetlights adjusting their brightness based on ambient light, leading to significant energy savings. Furthermore, applications in agriculture, especially for precision farming techniques, are garnering considerable interest in states like Punjab and Haryana.", "normalised": "One key area of focus is smart city development. five G infrastructure is crucial for connecting sensors, enabling real-time data collection for traffic management, waste management, and public safety initiatives.

{"unnormalised": "However, the rollout hasn't been without its challenges. The high costs associated with infrastructure development, including the deployment of base stations and fiber optic cables, remain a significant hurdle. The right of way (RoW) issues, particularly in densely populated urban areas, have also caused delays. Obtaining approvals for installing towers on buildings or digging trenches for laying cables can be a time-consuming process, often hampered by bureaucratic bottlenecks.", "normalised": "However, the rollout hasn't been without its challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The journey towards ubiquitous 5G coverage is a marathon, not a sprint. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain. Continued investment in infrastructure, favorable policy support, and a collaborative approach between government, industry, and academia are essential for realizing the full potential of 5G and transforming India into a digitally empowered nation. Imagine a farmer in a remote village in Bihar, using a 5G-connected drone to monitor his crops over a 200 sq ft area, receiving real-time data on soil health and irrigation needs – that's the transformative power of 5G in action.", "normalised": "The journey towards ubiquitous five G coverage is a marathon, not a sprint.
