However, a significant digital divide remains. The rural areas, like many villages in Bihar, are still struggling with even basic four G connectivity. Achieving ubiquitous five G coverage will require significant infrastructural investment."}

Building the necessary cell towers and fiber optic networks requires substantial capital. While the government is offering incentives, like the P L I scheme, implementation is slow.

Maybe in the coming weeks, by say, fifteenth November two thousand and twenty four, we might see better infrastructure. We have to ensure the rollout isn't just another 'Sone Ki Chidiya' dream for a few. We're still trying to get the fiber laid by the end of this year, thirty first December two thousand and twenty four. It’s nine zero zero hours now, and I'm keen to hear your perspective.
