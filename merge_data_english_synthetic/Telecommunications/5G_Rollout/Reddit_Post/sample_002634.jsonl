Furthermore, affordability remains a concern for a large segment of the population, hindering widespread adoption. While data plans are becoming cheaper, the cost of 5G enabled devices remains a barrier for many.", "normalised": "We are seeing reports that the required density of cell towers in urban areas to achieve optimal five G speeds (approximately one tower every five hundred meter in densely populated areas) isn't being met consistently.

What challenges do you foresee in achieving complete nationwide 5G coverage, especially considering factors like right-of-way approvals and the availability of skilled manpower? Is the promised 100 Mbps being delivered, or is it just marketing hype? A new tower is being built near my ancestral home, roughly 1000 sq ft in area, in Varanasi. Dr. Sharma, a prominent telecom engineer, believes we will see true 5G speeds in smaller towns by late 2024, but at a cost of Rs. 300-400 per month for an adequate plan.", "normalised": "What are your thoughts on the current progress?
