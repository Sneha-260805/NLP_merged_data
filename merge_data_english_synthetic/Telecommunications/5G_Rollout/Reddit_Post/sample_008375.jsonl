{"unnormalised": "I wanted to initiate a discussion on the ongoing 5G rollout in India. We've seen significant progress since the auctions back in Q3 2022. Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their networks, covering major metro areas like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai, and are now pushing into Tier-2 cities such as Lucknow and Jaipur. Vodafone Idea is also gradually catching up, albeit at a slower pace.", "normalised": "I wanted to initiate a discussion on the ongoing five G rollout in India.

Download speeds are reportedly reaching several hundred Mbps in optimal conditions, significantly faster than existing 4G networks. However, true user experience varies widely depending on location, network congestion, and device compatibility.", "normalised": "Network performance, from initial reports, seems promising.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, however. Fiberization of cell towers is still a bottleneck. A significant percentage of towers still rely on older connectivity solutions, hindering the full potential of 5G. Spectrum availability, especially in the mmWave bands, also needs further clarification and allocation by TRAI to support future growth and higher bandwidth applications.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, however.
