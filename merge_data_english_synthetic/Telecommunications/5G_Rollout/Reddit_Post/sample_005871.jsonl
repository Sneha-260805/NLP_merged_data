Reports suggest Jio claims coverage in over 6,000 cities, while Airtel is focusing on targeted rollouts. However, rural penetration remains a significant hurdle. Availability beyond tier-II cities like Lucknow or Jaipur is limited.", "normalised": "Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their networks, covering a significant portion of major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.

{"unnormalised": "I'm interested in hearing your perspectives. What has your 5G experience been like? Are you seeing the promised speeds and latency improvements? Are there specific areas where you believe more attention is needed, perhaps from TRAI or DOT? I'm personally based near IIT Madras and the network performance seems variable. I will be doing some tests around 14:00 hrs on 15/08/2024. Thoughts? Perhaps a similar situation exists for other users around IISc Bangalore. Are operators truly committed to achieving widespread coverage by the target date of 31/12/2024, or will we see further delays?", "normalised": "I am interested in hearing your perspectives.
