{"unnormalised": "The pace has been undeniably brisk since the auctions in July 2022. Jio and Airtel seem to be leading the charge, aggressively expanding their networks. I've personally noticed improved speeds in areas like Connaught Place, Delhi. However, coverage remains patchy. One can have blazing fast speeds in one spot and then drop to 4G just a few meters away. The densification of towers seems crucial.", "normalised": "The pace has been undeniably brisk since the auctions in July two thousand and twenty two.
