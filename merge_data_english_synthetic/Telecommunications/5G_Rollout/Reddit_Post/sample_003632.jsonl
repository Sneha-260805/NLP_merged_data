While users in Connaught Place, Delhi, might experience speeds exceeding 500 Mbps, coverage remains patchy in more suburban areas. Also, the availability of affordable 5G-enabled devices is still a significant barrier for widespread adoption, especially amongst the rural population. Many still rely on their 4G devices even now.", "normalised": "However, reports suggest the experience isn't uniform.

We are hoping to see some action on this front by Q4 2024. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) target of covering 80% of the country by March 2025 seems ambitious, considering the infrastructural challenges in regions like Arunachal Pradesh.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the delayed spectrum auctions for the millimeter Wave bands are holding back the deployment of truly high speed, low latency applications.

What do you think needs to be done to accelerate the rollout and ensure equitable access across the country, especially given the importance of digital inclusion for initiatives like Digital India?

Perhaps a workshop organized by IIT Madras can shed more light on these topics at 14:00 hrs next Friday.", "normalised": "What are your experiences with five G in India?
