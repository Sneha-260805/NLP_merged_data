While significant progress has been made since its initial launch in Oct 2022, several key challenges persist. Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their 5G networks, reaching a considerable number of cities and towns, including tier-2 cities like Patna and Lucknow. We're seeing impressive speed improvements, particularly in densely populated areas.", "normalised": "I wanted to initiate a discussion regarding the current state of Five G rollout across India.

{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the availability of 5G-enabled devices remains a barrier for many. While prices are gradually decreasing, a substantial portion of the population still relies on 4G handsets. Secondly, consistent coverage is an issue. Even within urban areas like Mumbai, pockets of 4G persist, impacting the user experience. The availability of spectrum, particularly in the 700 MHz band, remains a contention.", "normalised": "Firstly, the availability of Five G-enabled devices remains a barrier for many. While prices are gradually decreasing, a substantial portion of the population still relies on Four G handsets. Secondly, consistent coverage is an issue.
