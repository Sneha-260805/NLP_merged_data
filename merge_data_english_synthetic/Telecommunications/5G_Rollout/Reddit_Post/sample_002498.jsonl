Initial reports suggest significant improvements in download speeds, with users experiencing rates multiple times faster than existing four G infrastructure."}
{"unnormalised": "Namaste fellow telecom enthusiasts,", "normalised": "However, coverage remains a significant challenge. Anecdotal evidence from colleagues suggests that consistent five G connectivity is primarily limited to densely populated areas and commercial hubs like Hazratganj and Mall Road. Rural areas and even some residential colonies within cities still lack adequate five G signal strength."}
