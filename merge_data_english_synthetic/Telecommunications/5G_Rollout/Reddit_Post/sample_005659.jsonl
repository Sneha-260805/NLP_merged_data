Tower infrastructure upgrades are proving to be a bottleneck in several Tier-Two and Tier-Three cities. Acquiring necessary permits and right-of-way is causing delays in some areas. Plus, there’s the issue of cost. Upgrading to five G-compatible devices isn't feasible for everyone, especially in rural India. We need to address the digital divide effectively, ensuring everyone has access to affordable connectivity."}
