While operators are deploying small cells to enhance coverage, obtaining permissions from local municipalities, especially in older cities like Varanasi, can be a bottleneck. Right-of-way issues are also prevalent.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain. One major hurdle is the infrastructure.
