{"unnormalised": "Namaste, fellow telecom enthusiasts!", "normalised": "Just wanted to open a discussion on the current state of five G rollout in India. We've seen significant progress, especially from Jio and Airtel, expanding their networks across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. Coverage is improving, but patchy in smaller towns, say areas around Kochi for example."}

We're still a ways off from ubiquitous coverage, which is crucial for realizing the full potential of five G for applications like smart agriculture and remote healthcare in places like rural Bihar."}

Reports suggest spectrum auctions have been yielding significant revenue for the G O I, but might be slowing down rollout. R and D investments also need a boost, especially at institutions like I I T Madras, to develop indigenous five G solutions."}

While phone prices are decreasing, they're still a barrier for many Indians, particularly in lower income groups. I read some analysts are predicting that by Diwali two thousand and twenty four, greater than fifty percent of smartphones will be five G capable."}

Right-of-way approvals and fiber optic cable deployment are often slow processes, delaying progress. We need faster clearances, I believe."}
