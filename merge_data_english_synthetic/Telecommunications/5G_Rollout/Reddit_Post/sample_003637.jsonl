Vodafone Idea (Vi) is a bit behind schedule, but expected to ramp up significantly in the coming months.", "normalised": "I wanted to provide a concise update on the five G rollout across India.

{"unnormalised": "Coverage remains the biggest hurdle. While major cities have pockets of decent 5G, widespread availability, especially in tier 2 & 3 cities and rural areas (think beyond Gurgaon, towards Bihar), is still some time away. Challenges include RoW (Right of Way) permissions, particularly in densely populated areas like Kolkata, and the cost of infrastructure deployment. We're talking potentially crores of Rs. per tower, and the required density is much higher than with 4G.", "normalised": "Coverage remains the biggest hurdle.
