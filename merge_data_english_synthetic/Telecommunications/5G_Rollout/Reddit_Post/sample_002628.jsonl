Airtel and Jio have been aggressively expanding their 5G networks, particularly across major metropolitan areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. Initial reports suggest impressive speeds in areas with good coverage, exceeding 500 Mbps in some instances, allowing for seamless 4K streaming and low-latency gaming.", "normalised": "I wanted to initiate a discussion on the current state of five G rollout in India.
