I wanted to initiate a discussion on the progress and challenges surrounding the five G rollout across India. While the initial launch on first october two thousand and twenty two generated significant buzz, the actual user experience remains highly variable, particularly outside of Tier one cities like Mumbai and Delhi."}

Are villages seeing any meaningful impact from five G, or is it still largely confined to urban centers? Has anyone seen any positive impact on rural broadband infrastructure programs, like BharatNet, following the introduction of five G on fifteenth august two thousand and twenty three? What strategies are being employed to address the backhaul capacity limitations hindering widespread five G adoption beyond a few kilometer radius from cell towers? Let's discuss."}
