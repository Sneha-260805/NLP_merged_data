However, coverage remains patchy.

Concerns about handset compatibility and the perceived cost of Five G data plans (around rupee six hundred and ninety nine per month in some areas) are likely contributing factors. Furthermore, rural areas remain largely underserved, with many villages still lacking reliable Four G connectivity. The promise of enhanced agricultural applications and telemedicine, envisioned by institutions like I I T Madras, remains largely unrealized in these regions."}
