The delay in the auction of the mmWave spectrum, for example, is hindering the deployment of ultra-fast 5G services. Fiberisation is another bottleneck. Connecting cell towers with fiber optics is crucial for backhaul capacity, but progress has been slower than anticipated. I remember seeing better fiber connections in DDLJ!", "normalised": "One major challenge is the availability of adequate spectrum in key bands.
