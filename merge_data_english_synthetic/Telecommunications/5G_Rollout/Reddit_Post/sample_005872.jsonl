{"unnormalised": "Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively rolling out their networks, aiming to cover key metros and Tier-II cities like Lucknow and Coimbatore. Coverage in rural areas is still lagging, understandably due to infrastructure limitations and ROI considerations. This presents a significant challenge, particularly given the Digital India initiative and the need to bridge the digital divide. What strategies do you believe would be most effective in accelerating 5G adoption in these underserved areas?", "normalised": "Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively rolling out their networks, aiming to cover key metros and Tier-two cities like Lucknow and Coimbatore.
