{"unnormalised": "It's been roughly a year since 5G rollout commenced in India, and I wanted to share some observations and insights on its progress, particularly from a network engineering perspective. Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their 5G networks across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. We're seeing impressive speeds, often exceeding 500 Mbps, and latency figures that rival fiber in certain areas.", "normalised": "It's been roughly a year since five G rollout commenced in India, and I wanted to share some observations and insights on its progress, particularly from a network engineering perspective. Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. We're seeing impressive speeds, often exceeding five hundred M B P S, and latency figures that rival fiber in certain areas."}
{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Spectrum allocation issues in certain circles, especially around the 26 GHz band, are causing bottlenecks. The \"right of way\" permissions for installing cell towers, especially in densely populated areas like Kolkata's Burrabazar, can be a bureaucratic nightmare. The infrastructure build-out, particularly fiber backhaul to support the increased bandwidth demands, is crucial, and progress seems uneven across different states.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, device penetration remains a key factor. While 5G handset sales are increasing, a significant portion of the Indian population still uses 4G devices. This creates a mixed network environment that operators need to manage effectively. Also, the digital divide continues to be a concern. Ensuring equitable access to 5G in rural areas, where connectivity is often limited, is paramount. Think of the farmers in Punjab accessing agricultural data via 5G - a game changer.", "normalised": "Furthermore, device penetration remains a key factor.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, a lighter note. I overheard some engineers discussing the best spot to deploy a new tower near a biryani stall in Hyderabad. Apparently, lunch breaks are a key consideration! What are your experiences with 5G in India? Have you noticed any significant improvements in connectivity, especially during festivals like Onam when network congestion tends to spike? Share your thoughts!", "normalised": "Finally, a lighter note. I overheard some engineers discussing the best spot to deploy a new tower near a biryani stall in Hyderabad.
