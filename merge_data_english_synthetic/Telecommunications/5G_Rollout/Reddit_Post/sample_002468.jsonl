Are we seeing adequate cell tower density, particularly in rural areas like Bihar or Rajasthan, to ensure consistent coverage? Anecdotally, I've heard complaints from family in Patna about inconsistent speeds."}

Are the data plans genuinely affordable for the average Indian consumer (considering the significant difference in purchasing power compared to, say, the U S)? Are the initial heavy investments made worth the eventual profits, measured in rupees?"}

I believe unlocking the potential requires a collaborative effort from the government, telecom operators, and the general public. For example, real-time crop monitoring in a ten thousand square foot farm using five G enabled sensors can yield much better results."}
