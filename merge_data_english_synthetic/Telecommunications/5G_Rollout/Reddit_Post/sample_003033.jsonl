While the initial euphoria surrounding lightning-fast speeds reminiscent of a Dharma Productions film has subsided, we need to analyze the current landscape more critically.", "normalised": "the progress is undeniable. Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks across major metropolitan areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. coverage is reaching smaller Tier two cities like Lucknow and Jaipur. initial speed tests report impressive gains, with some users experiencing downloads at five hundred M B P S and uploads around one hundred and fifty M B P S, a significant leap from previous four G speeds."}
