While Reliance is pushing Jio Bharat phones at a lower price point, more affordable options are needed to truly democratize access.", "normalised": "However, challenges persist.

We're talking about needing to cover potentially thousands of km. The target of 6 lakh villages by, say, 2025 seems ambitious.", "normalised": "Then there's the issue of infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "What are your observations on 5G adoption in your areas? Are you experiencing consistently high speeds and low latency? What steps do you think the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) should prioritize? Let's discuss constructively. This conference call on the DoT next week at 10:00 hrs is scheduled to address some of this. I think the 26 GHz band will be key for enterprise applications at IIT Madras, for instance.", "normalised": "What are your observations on five G adoption in your areas?
