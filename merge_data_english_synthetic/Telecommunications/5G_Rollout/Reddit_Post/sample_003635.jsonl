{"unnormalised": "Namaste fellow Redditors!", "normalised": "Let's discuss the five G rollout across India. It's been a year since the initial spectrum auction and operators like Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks. Coverage is concentrated in metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, but tier two and three cities are gradually being included. I've personally experienced improved speeds near my home in Chennai."}

Infrastructure limitations, especially fiber deployment (required for enhanced backhaul), are a major bottleneck. Right-of-way issues and regulatory hurdles also delay deployments. Some older areas in Kolkata have still not received sufficient fibre optic coverage, limiting five G accessibility. Cost is another factor, particularly for rural subscribers. While subsidized data packages are being offered, device affordability remains a concern for many."}

What do you think are the biggest roadblocks, and what strategies can be implemented to ensure wider and more equitable access, especially in areas like the Northeast? Discuss! Remember the telecom revolution of the nineties; this should ideally reach everyone by fifteenth August two thousand and twenty five. I read somewhere that the average five G download speed at five thirty P M is around three hundred megabits per second, but that feels a bit optimistic sometimes. Let's hear your thoughts!"}
