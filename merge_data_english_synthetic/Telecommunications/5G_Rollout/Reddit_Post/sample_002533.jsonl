The speed and breadth of deployment, especially after the auctions in August two thousand and twenty two, are quite remarkable.

The increased energy consumption and potential electromagnetic radiation within a two thousand square feet radius of a tower needs careful study. Perhaps Doctor Sharma from the Indian Institute of Science could offer some insights? The initial investment of rupee one point five trillion by telcos is significant, but sustainability must be prioritized. Let's discuss."}
