{"unnormalised": "One key challenge seems to be the infrastructure required. Laying fiber optic cables, especially in rural areas like, say, somewhere 50 km outside Varanasi, is proving difficult. Then there's the issue of tower density. We need significantly more towers to provide the promised coverage and bandwidth. Also, the cost of 5G handsets is still a barrier for many. A decent 5G phone still sets you back a good few thousand Rs.", "normalised": "One key challenge seems to be the infrastructure required.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the impact of 5G on various sectors. Will it truly revolutionize industries like manufacturing (think smart factories in places like Pune) or healthcare (telemedicine in remote villages)? It all seems promising, but we need to see tangible benefits on a large scale. Let's discuss!
