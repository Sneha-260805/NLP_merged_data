As many of you know, Reliance Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their five G networks, targeting pan-India coverage by late two thousand and twenty four. We're seeing deployment in major metros like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, and also expanding to Tier-two cities such as Kochi and Jaipur."}

This is a massive leap compared to existing four G infrastructure, opening up possibilities for enhanced A R slash V R experiences, I O T applications, and smart city initiatives."}

Spectrum allocation issues, particularly regarding the allocation of E-band spectrum, need resolution. Furthermore, infrastructure upgrades, including the deployment of more base stations and fiber optic cables, are crucial. Many rural areas still lack sufficient fiber connectivity to support five G speeds. Think of it like trying to serve biryani at an Onam sadhya - it just doesn't quite fit without the right foundational elements!"}
