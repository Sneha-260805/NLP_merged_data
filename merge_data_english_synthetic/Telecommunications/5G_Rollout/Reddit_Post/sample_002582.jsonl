{"unnormalised": "Namaste telecommunications enthusiasts!", "normalised": "As we approach Diwali, it's a good time to reflect on the five G rollout across India. Jio and Airtel have been aggressively expanding their networks, covering major metros like Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai. Initial reports suggest speeds are significantly faster than four G, exceeding two hundred Megabits per second in many areas, offering a substantial upgrade for streaming, gaming, and cloud services."}
