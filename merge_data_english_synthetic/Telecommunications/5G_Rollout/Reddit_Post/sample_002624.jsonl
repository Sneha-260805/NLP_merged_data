{"unnormalised": "I've been following the 5G rollout across India with keen interest, particularly after the spectrum auctions last year. Jio, Airtel, and Vi are all aggressively expanding their networks, promising speeds many times faster than 4G. We're seeing good coverage in metro areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai, but what about Tier 2 & 3 cities?", "normalised": "I have been following the five g rollout across India with keen interest, particularly after the spectrum auctions last year.

Right-of-way approvals for laying fiber optic cables are still a bottleneck in many states, especially in rural areas. There are also concerns about the affordability of 5G-enabled devices for a large segment of the population. High tariffs could hinder adoption.", "normalised": "Reports suggest significant progress in deploying base stations. However, challenges remain.
