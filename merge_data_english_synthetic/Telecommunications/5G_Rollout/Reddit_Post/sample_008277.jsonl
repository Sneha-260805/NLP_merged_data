How can we encourage innovation and the development of five G-based applications tailored to the Indian market, beyond just increased bandwidth for streaming Bollywood movies? Consider, for example, applications in telemedicine, agriculture (precision farming), and smart city initiatives in cities like Jaipur. Early reports indicate one firm secured a contract to provide five G-enabled security surveillance for two thousand square feet of marketplace. Costing rupee fifty thousand."}
