{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. Coverage in rural areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is lagging, raising concerns about a digital divide. Spectrum allocation is a key factor; the upcoming auctions will be crucial for further expansion. Cost is another hurdle. While initial plans are relatively affordable (Rs. 239 onwards), data usage can quickly escalate expenses, especially for low-income households.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
