In major metros like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, the availability is becoming quite prevalent, even in bustling areas like Connaught Place and M G Road. However, tier two and tier three cities, like Kanpur and Patna, are still seeing patchy coverage."}

Spectrum allocation remains a key factor, with the next round of auctions likely to be crucial for wider coverage, especially in rural areas. What are your thoughts on the affordability of five G plans? Are the current offerings competitive, considering the limited five G device penetration, especially outside the major cities?"}

Many cell towers are still undergoing upgrades, and backhaul capacity remains a limiting factor in some areas. What is your experience with five G in your area? Are you seeing improvements in connectivity and speeds? Share your experiences and let's discuss! This discussion should end before seventeen zero zero hours. Let's keep it professional, folks."}
