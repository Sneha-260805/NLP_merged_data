Also, what are your thoughts on the recent announcement by IIT Madras regarding indigenous 5G technology development, scheduled to be tested by 10:00 hrs on 15/08/2024? It could significantly reduce our dependence on foreign vendors. Finally, are there any updates on the BharatNet project and its role in supporting the 5G rollout, particularly in rural areas covering ~600,000 villages by end of 2025 with a budget of Rs. 70,000 crore?
