Initial projections indicate download speeds of up to 1 Gbps, enabling seamless streaming and online education experiences. Investment in the project is estimated at Rs. 200 Crores. The improved connectivity is also expected to positively impact local economies, especially in areas with significant cottage industries needing access to online marketplaces. A pilot project in a small village saw a rise in local artisans selling their handicrafts online, increasing their incomes. Many now run online shops from spaces as small as 200 sq ft in their homes. Furthermore, this expansion supports the growing demand for bandwidth in urban areas witnessing increased remote work trends post-pandemic.", "normalised": "The company plans to deploy over five thousand kilometer of fiber optic cable in the next fiscal year, connecting approximately fifty thousand homes and businesses.
