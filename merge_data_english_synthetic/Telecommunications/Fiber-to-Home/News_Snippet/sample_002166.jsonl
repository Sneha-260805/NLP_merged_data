The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi is collaborating with several telecom companies on research and development to optimize fiber deployment strategies and reduce costs. Recent data indicates an average FTTH speed of 150 Mbps across major metropolitan areas, with speeds reaching up to 1 Gbps in select locations. The government aims to achieve pan-India gigabit connectivity in the coming decade. Analysts estimate the FTTH market in India to reach Rs. 50,000 crore by 2028, connecting over 80 million homes. The rapid expansion also requires skilled manpower with over 5000 km of fibre being laid per month, creating many new jobs.", "normalised": "Meanwhile, B S N L continues its efforts to modernize its network, although challenges remain.
