Laying fiber optic cables can be a logistical nightmare, sometimes reminding me of the comedic chaos in a classic Bollywood film, *Hera Pheri*. The sheer scale of infrastructure development across such a vast country also presents a formidable financial challenge. I've seen estimates ranging from several thousand Rs. to tens of thousands of Rs. per household for FTTH deployment.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, of course.
