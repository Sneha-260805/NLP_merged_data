This transition from older technologies like copper to fiber is crucial for supporting the growing bandwidth demands of Indian households. Think 4K streaming on multiple devices, online gaming, and remote work, all happening simultaneously – something that was a dream just a few years ago.", "normalised": "We've seen a significant push from providers like Jio Fiber, Airtel Xstream Fiber, and A C T Fibernet to bring high speed internet directly to homes.

Have you seen price drops? Has the 'Lagaan' like struggle for connectivity truly ended, or are we still far from the target? Let's hear your thoughts! Let's even discuss the research done at institutions like IIT Madras on optimizing fiber optic networks.", "normalised": "My question to the community is: what are your experiences with F T T H?
