{"unnormalised": "Namaste, fellow telecom enthusiasts! I wanted to start a discussion on the state of Fiber-to-Home (FTTH) deployment in India. We've seen significant investment, particularly from Jio and Airtel, in expanding their fiber networks to homes across the country. The promise of gigabit speeds for streaming Bollywood films like \"3 Idiots\" in 4K and supporting online education is compelling.", "normalised": "Namaste, fellow telecom enthusiasts!
