Factors like RoW (Right of Way) permissions from local municipalities (often slower than a Bollywood movie plot twist!), the availability of skilled labour, and the upfront capital expenditure required are proving to be significant hurdles. We are particularly looking into the effectiveness of GPON technology in these deployments.", "normalised": "We're seeing decent uptake in areas where JioFiber and Airtel Xstream have already established a presence, but penetrating deeper into Tier three cities presents unique challenges.
