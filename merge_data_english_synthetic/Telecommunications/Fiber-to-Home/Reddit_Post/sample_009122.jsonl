{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the right-of-way (ROW) acquisition. Getting permission to lay fiber optic cables, especially in densely populated areas like Chandni Chowk, can be a bureaucratic nightmare. Multiple departments involved, and it often feels like *Deewar* – \"Aaj mere paas building hai, property hai, bank balance hai, kya hai tumhare paas?\" \"Mere paas right-of-way nahi hai.\" It's a slow process.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the right of way R O W acquisition.

While fiber optic cables themselves are becoming more affordable, the cost of digging, labor (skilled technicians are in demand), and equipment (splicing machines, OTDRs) adds up significantly.
