As bandwidth demands from households surge - thanks to binge-watching Bollywood classics like Sholay on multiple devices simultaneously - robust internet infrastructure is becoming critical."}

I am particularly interested in the challenges and opportunities they face, especially in rural areas. Getting fiber to remote villages in Bihar, for example, presents logistical hurdles that differ significantly from urban deployments in Mumbai."}
