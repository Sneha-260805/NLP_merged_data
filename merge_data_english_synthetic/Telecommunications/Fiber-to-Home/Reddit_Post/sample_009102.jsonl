{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm seeing significant discrepancies in service quality and availability between urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi, versus Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities such as Lucknow or Indore. While JIO Fiber and Airtel Xstream are aggressively expanding, infrastructure remains a bottleneck. Right-of-way approvals from local municipalities, especially in densely populated areas with old buildings (think the chawls in Mumbai), are proving to be a major hurdle, causing delays and increasing costs.", "normalised": "Specifically, I am seeing significant discrepancies in service quality and availability between urban centers like Mumbai and Delhi, versus Tier-two and Tier-three cities such as Lucknow or Indore.

{"unnormalised": "We're also seeing issues with affordability. While initial plans look attractive, the actual cost of installation (Rs. 2500-5000) and higher-tier plans needed for reliable bandwidth (especially for families with multiple devices streaming content) can be prohibitive for many households, especially when you add in the price of an OTT subscription like Hotstar. Is there scope for subsidized broadband plans, perhaps inspired by initiatives like the BharatNet project, but focused on FTTH?", "normalised": "We are also seeing issues with affordability.

{"unnormalised": "On the opportunity side, the potential for digital transformation is immense. Imagine telemedicine reaching rural communities, online education accessible to students in remote villages, and even boosting the local e-commerce ecosystem. If we can build robust and affordable FTTH infrastructure, India can truly unlock its potential, just like the characters in \"Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year\" hustling to deliver quality service, against the odds. Organizations like IIT-Delhi should focus more on optimizing cost effective deployment of FTTH.
