{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the infrastructure is a major hurdle. We're often dealing with congested underground ducts, requiring significant civil works (think \"Gully Boy\" level grit!). Securing RoW (Right of Way) permissions from local authorities can be a lengthy and bureaucratic process, adding unforeseen delays and costs to the deployment schedule. I remember back in 2015, even BSNL struggled with this in rural areas.", "normalised": "Firstly, the infrastructure is a major hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, cost sensitivity is high. People are used to paying X amount for broadband using older tech, so justifying a slightly higher monthly fee for significantly better bandwidth requires strong marketing highlighting the benefits of low latency for online education, streaming, and remote work. We need to clearly illustrate that the benefits are worth the investment, like explaining the ROI to a seasoned businessman in Dalal Street.", "normalised": "Secondly, cost sensitivity is high.
