{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest hurdles is right-of-way (ROW) permissions. Getting approvals from various municipalities across states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar can be a real \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\" situation – sometimes joyful, sometimes full of obstacles! Delays in these permissions drastically impact rollout speed and increase costs. Imagine needing to dig up roads in a densely populated area like Chandni Chowk; it's a logistical nightmare!", "normalised": "One of the biggest hurdles is right of way (R O W) permissions.

Many smaller ISPs struggle to compete with larger players like Jio and Airtel in this regard. Government initiatives like BharatNet are crucial for bridging the digital divide and ensuring affordable FTTH access for all. What are your thoughts on the role of private-public partnerships in accelerating FTTH deployment nationwide?", "normalised": "Further, the initial investment is considerable.
