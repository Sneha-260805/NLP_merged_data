{"unnormalised": "One major hurdle is the cost. While Reliance Jio has aggressively priced their JioFiber plans, making it accessible to a wider audience, many local ISPs struggle to compete. The infrastructure costs, including right-of-way permits and laying fiber cables, can be prohibitive, especially in densely populated areas like Mumbai. Estimates place the average cost per household at upwards of Rs. 15,000.", "normalised": "One major hurdle is the cost.
