{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "Hello fellow telecommunications enthusiasts! I wanted to initiate a discussion regarding the ongoing F T T H rollout across India. From what I have observed in cities like Bengaluru and Mumbai, the deployment is accelerating, especially with Reliance Jio and Airtel aggressively expanding their fiber networks. It is a welcome change from the older copper infrastructure, offering significantly higher bandwidth and lower latency. However, challenges persist. The last mile connectivity, particularly in densely populated areas like Old Delhi, can be a significant hurdle. Right of way approvals from local municipalities can be excruciatingly slow, and the costs associated with trenching and laying fiber optic cables in congested urban environments are substantial. I read a study from I I T Madras suggesting innovative trenchless technologies could dramatically reduce deployment time and disruption. Furthermore, affordability remains a concern for many. While entry level F T T H plans are becoming more competitive, a significant portion of the population, especially in rural areas, still cannot afford high speed internet. We need innovative pricing models and subsidies to ensure digital inclusion. This reminds me of that dialogue from three Idiots – Success follows excellence, but in this case, accessibility enables excellence! Anyone working on F T T H deployments or have insights into the challenges and opportunities? What are your thoughts on the future of F T T H in India? Looking forward to your inputs. Jai Hind!"}
