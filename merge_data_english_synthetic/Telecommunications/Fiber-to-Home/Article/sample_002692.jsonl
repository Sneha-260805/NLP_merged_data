{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the widespread availability of FTTH is crucial for realizing the vision of a smart nation. Smart city projects rely heavily on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity for various applications, including smart grids, intelligent transportation systems, and e-governance services. Expect further announcements regarding nationwide FTTH rollout plans around 15/08/2024, Independence Day. Implementation often requires significant overnight work, typically commencing around 22:00 hrs to minimize disruption. The target for complete nationwide coverage remains set for 2030, though challenges in mountainous regions like Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir may require additional time and innovative solutions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the widespread availability of F T T H is crucial for realizing the vision of a smart nation.
