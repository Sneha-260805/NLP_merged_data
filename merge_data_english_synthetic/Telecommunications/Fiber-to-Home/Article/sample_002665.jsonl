{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, promising unparalleled broadband speeds and enhanced connectivity for residential users. Unlike traditional copper-based infrastructure or even Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN) solutions, FTTH delivers fiber optic cables directly to individual homes, eliminating bandwidth bottlenecks and paving the way for bandwidth-intensive applications like 4K video streaming, online gaming, and seamless telecommuting.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, promising unparalleled broadband speeds and enhanced connectivity for residential users.

{"unnormalised": "The shift towards FTTH is driven by the increasing demand for faster and more reliable internet access in Indian households. From bustling metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns like Kanpur and Coimbatore, consumers are craving bandwidth to support multiple devices and demanding applications. This demand has spurred significant investment from both private telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, as well as public sector undertakings such as BSNL. These companies are actively deploying FTTH networks across the country, connecting millions of homes and businesses.", "normalised": "The shift towards F T T H is driven by the increasing demand for faster and more reliable internet access in Indian households.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH are manifold. Firstly, it offers significantly higher bandwidth compared to older technologies. Download speeds of up to 1 Gbps are now readily available in some areas, allowing for near-instantaneous downloads and uploads. Secondly, FTTH provides a more stable and reliable connection, minimizing latency and jitter, crucial for applications like online gaming and video conferencing. Thirdly, the infrastructure is future-proof, capable of supporting even higher bandwidth demands as technology evolves.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "However, deploying FTTH on a massive scale in India presents several challenges. The initial investment costs are substantial, requiring extensive civil engineering work to lay the fiber optic cables. Right-of-way issues, particularly in densely populated urban areas, can also delay deployment. Furthermore, consumer awareness and affordability remain key factors. Educating consumers about the benefits of FTTH and offering competitive pricing plans are crucial for driving adoption.", "normalised": "However, deploying F T T H on a massive scale in India presents several challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has been actively promoting FTTH deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all villages with high-speed broadband. These efforts are aligned with the Digital India initiative, which envisions a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. We recall, the impetus was significantly enhanced post discussions held on 26/01/2015, pushing for faster rollout.", "normalised": "The Indian government has been actively promoting F T T H deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all villages with high-speed broadband.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, FTTH is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India. Experts predict that by 2025, a significant portion of Indian households will have access to FTTH connectivity. This transformation will not only enhance the digital experience for consumers but also drive economic growth and innovation. Initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, scheduled to have significant developments finalized by 31/12/2024 at 17:00 hrs, depend heavily on robust FTTH infrastructure. Furthermore, local manufacturing of optical fiber cables and related equipment, driven by schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, will further reduce costs and accelerate deployment. Even during the crucial 09:00 hrs meeting on 15/08/2023, the discussion revolved around the need for locally made fiber cables, estimated to cost around Rs. 500 per km. These locally produced cables will significantly boost infrastructure development.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, F T T H is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India.
