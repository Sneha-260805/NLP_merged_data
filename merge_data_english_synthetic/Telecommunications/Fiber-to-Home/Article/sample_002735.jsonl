{"unnormalised": "The advantages of FTTH are numerous. Bandwidth, capable of supporting symmetrical upload and download speeds exceeding 1 Gbps, allows seamless streaming of 4K content, lag-free online gaming for the young Rohan from Mumbai, and efficient video conferencing for professionals working from home in Bangalore. Lower latency translates to improved responsiveness in applications, vital for cloud gaming and real-time data processing. Furthermore, optical fiber is inherently more resistant to electromagnetic interference than copper, ensuring a stable and consistent connection, even during the monsoon season in Kerala.", "normalised": "The advantages of F T T H are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "The rollout of FTTH in India is being spearheaded by both government initiatives and private sector investments. BharatNet, a flagship project aiming to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed internet, relies heavily on FTTH infrastructure. Private players like Reliance Jio and Airtel are also aggressively expanding their fiber networks across major cities like Delhi and Chennai, offering competitive FTTH plans to consumers. \"We aim to cover 70% of urban households by 2027,\" declared Mr. Sharma, head of network expansion at Airtel, during a press conference held on 10/10/2023.", "normalised": "The rollout of F T T H in India is being spearheaded by both government initiatives and private sector investments.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain, however. The initial cost of deploying fiber optic infrastructure can be substantial, particularly in densely populated urban areas or remote rural locations like the hills of Himachal Pradesh. Obtaining right-of-way permits and navigating bureaucratic hurdles can also delay projects. \"Negotiations with local councils usually take longer than expected. We submitted our proposal on 01/01/2023, and are still awaiting approval,\" lamented a project manager from BSNL.", "normalised": "Challenges remain, however.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, FTTH offers future-proofing capabilities. Its vast bandwidth capacity can accommodate emerging technologies like 8K video streaming, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring that India remains at the forefront of the digital revolution. Investment in FTTH is therefore not just about upgrading internet speeds; it's about building a robust digital infrastructure for the future of India. In Hyderabad, several start-ups are already leveraging FTTH connectivity to develop innovative IoT solutions for smart homes and smart cities. With continued investment and strategic planning, FTTH has the potential to transform India into a truly digitally empowered nation, with improved access to information and opportunities for all its citizens. The projected cost of the project is Rs. 20,000 Cr.", "normalised": "Moreover, F T T H offers future-proofing capabilities.
