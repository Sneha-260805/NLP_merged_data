{"unnormalised": "The deployment of FTTH is gaining momentum across the country, driven by the increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming high-definition video, online gaming, and cloud-based services. Initiatives such as the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed internet, are heavily reliant on FTTH infrastructure. This government push is complementing efforts by private telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and BSNL, who are actively expanding their FTTH networks in urban and rural areas alike. As of 2023, the penetration rate of FTTH in India is still lower compared to other developed nations, presenting a significant growth opportunity.", "normalised": "the deployment of F T T H is gaining momentum across the country, driven by the increasing demand for bandwidth intensive applications like streaming high definition video, online gaming, and cloud based services.

{"unnormalised": "The advantages of FTTH are manifold. It offers symmetrical bandwidth, meaning the upload and download speeds are equal, crucial for activities like video conferencing and content creation. Furthermore, fiber optic cables are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference, resulting in more stable and reliable connections. This is particularly important in densely populated urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi, where traditional copper-based networks often suffer from congestion and performance degradation.", "normalised": "the advantages of F T T H are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "However, the deployment of FTTH also presents challenges. The initial capital expenditure (CAPEX) for laying fiber optic cables can be substantial, especially in geographically challenging regions. Obtaining Right of Way (RoW) permissions from various local authorities can also be a lengthy and complex process, delaying project timelines. The availability of skilled manpower for installation and maintenance is another concern. For instance, projects in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh often face delays due to these factors.", "normalised": "however, the deployment of F T T H also presents challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of FTTH far outweigh the costs. With the increasing adoption of smart homes, IoT devices, and online education, the demand for high-speed, reliable internet connectivity will only continue to grow. The launch of the 5G spectrum on 01/10/2022, has further accelerated FTTH adoption as it forms a crucial backhaul network for 5G towers. Moreover, FTTH infrastructure can support future technologies like 8K video streaming and augmented reality, ensuring that India remains at the forefront of the digital revolution.", "normalised": "despite these challenges, the long term benefits of F T T H far outweigh the costs.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, strategic collaborations between government and private players, streamlined regulatory processes, and investments in skill development are crucial for accelerating the deployment of FTTH across India. The target is to connect over 200 million homes by 2025, requiring significant investment and focused effort. A meeting at TRAI headquarters is scheduled on 15/03/2024 at 14:00 hrs to discuss policy recommendations for further promoting FTTH adoption. A project worth Rs. 5000 Cr. is sanctioned for expanding FTTH network in Rajasthan as of 20/07/2023. Successful implementation of FTTH will not only bridge the digital divide but also unlock new opportunities for economic growth and social development, empowering citizens across the country.", "normalised": "looking ahead, strategic collaborations between government and private players, streamlined regulatory processes, and investments in skill development are crucial for accelerating the deployment of F T T H across India.
