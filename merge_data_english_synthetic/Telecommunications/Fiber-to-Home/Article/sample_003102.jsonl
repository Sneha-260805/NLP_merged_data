{"unnormalised": "One of the key advantages of FTTH is its scalability. As bandwidth demands continue to grow, the fiber optic infrastructure can easily accommodate future upgrades without requiring significant infrastructure changes. This future-proof nature makes FTTH a strategic investment for both service providers and consumers. For example, a household consuming 100 Mbps today might require 1 Gbps in the next few years. FTTH provides the pathway to deliver this increased bandwidth.", "normalised": "One of the key advantages of F T T H is its scalability.

{"unnormalised": "The economic impact of FTTH is substantial. Studies conducted by institutions like IIT Madras indicate a strong correlation between high-speed internet access and GDP growth. Access to reliable broadband fuels innovation, promotes entrepreneurship, and facilitates access to education and healthcare services. The rise of e-commerce in India, particularly in rural areas, is directly linked to the availability of FTTH connectivity. The launch of JioFiber on 05/09/2019 marked a turning point in the Indian FTTH market, spurring competition and driving down prices for consumers.", "normalised": "The economic impact of F T T H is substantial.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain in ensuring widespread FTTH deployment. The high upfront costs associated with laying fiber optic cables, particularly in densely populated urban areas or remote rural regions, pose a significant hurdle. Right-of-way issues and regulatory hurdles can also delay project timelines. For example, obtaining permissions for digging in congested areas like Old Delhi can take considerable time. The planned fiber laying project near Chennai port was delayed for almost 6 months due to regulatory approvals as of 10:00 hrs on 22/07/2023.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain in ensuring widespread F T T H deployment.
