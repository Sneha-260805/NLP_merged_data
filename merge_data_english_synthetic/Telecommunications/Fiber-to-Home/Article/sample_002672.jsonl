{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering significantly faster and more reliable internet connectivity compared to traditional copper-based solutions. As the name suggests, FTTH involves running optical fiber cables directly to individual homes, replacing the last-mile copper infrastructure. This allows for symmetrical upload and download speeds, drastically improving user experience for bandwidth-intensive applications like video streaming, online gaming, and video conferencing, all crucial in today's digitally connected India.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering significantly faster and more reliable internet connectivity compared to traditional copper-based solutions.

{"unnormalised": "The rollout of FTTH across India is being spearheaded by both government initiatives and private players. BharatNet, a flagship project aimed at connecting all Gram Panchayats in the country, heavily relies on optical fiber infrastructure. As of 10/10/2024, significant progress has been made, but reaching every corner of the vast nation presents logistical challenges. Private telecom giants like Reliance Jio and Airtel are also aggressively expanding their FTTH networks, vying for market share in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. Airtel Xstream Fiber, for instance, offers plans with speeds reaching up to 1 Gbps, catering to the growing demand for high-speed internet among urban households.", "normalised": "The rollout of F T T H across India is being spearheaded by both government initiatives and private players.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH extend beyond just faster internet speeds. Lower latency is a crucial advantage, particularly for gamers and financial traders. Imagine seamless online gaming experiences without lag or delays, or real-time stock market updates allowing for split-second decision-making. Furthermore, FTTH is more reliable and less susceptible to interference compared to copper wires, resulting in fewer outages and a more consistent internet connection.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H extend beyond just faster internet speeds.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of FTTH installation has been a barrier to widespread adoption, especially in rural areas where the return on investment for telecom companies is lower. However, the declining cost of fiber optic cables and improved installation techniques are making FTTH more affordable. Government subsidies and incentives are also playing a role in bridging the digital divide and encouraging FTTH deployments in underserved regions. One such initiative, launched on 26/01/2023, aimed to provide subsidized FTTH connections to households below the poverty line in several districts across Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "The cost of F T T H installation has been a barrier to widespread adoption, especially in rural areas where the return on investment for telecom companies is lower.
