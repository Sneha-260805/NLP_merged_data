{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering unparalleled bandwidth and reliability compared to traditional copper-based infrastructure. Unlike older technologies like DSL, which rely on aging copper wires, FTTH utilizes optical fiber cables to deliver data directly to individual homes, enabling significantly faster internet speeds and improved overall performance. This translates to a smoother online experience for everything from streaming Bollywood movies to participating in online classes.", "normalised": "Fiber to the Home (F T T H) is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering unparalleled bandwidth and reliability compared to traditional copper based infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH are multifaceted. First and foremost, it provides significantly higher bandwidth. Consumers in Mumbai, for instance, can now readily access speeds exceeding 100 Mbps, enabling simultaneous use of multiple devices without any noticeable lag. Furthermore, FTTH networks are less susceptible to interference and degradation compared to copper networks, resulting in a more stable and consistent connection, crucial for applications like video conferencing and online gaming. The reliability is a boon for businesses too, reducing downtime and improving productivity.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H are multifaceted. First and foremost, it provides significantly higher bandwidth. Consumers in Mumbai, for instance, can now readily access speeds exceeding one hundred Megabits per second, enabling simultaneous use of multiple devices without any noticeable lag.

{"unnormalised": "The government is also actively promoting FTTH deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, which aims to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed broadband. The deadline for achieving significant connectivity milestones was initially set around 2022, but challenges remain in remote areas. Rural electrification projects are often intertwined, needing coordinated deployment. Imagine the impact of delivering telemedicine to villages in Bihar accessible from AIIMS Delhi at 14:30 hrs via FTTH.", "normalised": "The government is also actively promoting F T T H deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, which aims to connect all Gram Panchayats with high speed broadband.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of FTTH in India. The initial investment required for deploying fiber optic cables is substantial, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Delhi and Chennai, where digging permits and right-of-way issues can be complex. Furthermore, consumer awareness about the benefits of FTTH needs to be improved. Many consumers are still unaware of the significant performance difference compared to traditional technologies.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of F T T H in India.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, FTTH is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India. As the demand for bandwidth continues to grow, fueled by the increasing adoption of streaming services, online gaming, and the Internet of Things (IoT), FTTH will be essential for meeting the needs of Indian consumers and businesses. On 26/01/2025, we can expect a significant boost in FTTH infrastructure across the country as per industry reports. Investments in research and development are also crucial for further optimizing FTTH technology and reducing deployment costs. On 15/08/2024, a new regulatory framework is expected that will ease deployment. Expect capital expenditure of Rs. 2000 crores by large players in the next fiscal year.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, F T T H is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India.
