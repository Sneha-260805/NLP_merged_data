{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology represents a significant advancement in India's telecommunications infrastructure, promising to deliver enhanced bandwidth and improved connectivity to households across the nation. Unlike traditional copper-based infrastructure, FTTH utilizes optical fiber cables directly connecting the service provider’s central office to individual residences. This deployment facilitates the transmission of data at speeds far exceeding those achievable with legacy technologies like DSL or cable internet.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H) technology represents a significant advancement in India's telecommunications infrastructure, promising to deliver enhanced bandwidth and improved connectivity to households across the nation.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, FTTH boasts superior reliability compared to copper infrastructure. Optical fiber is less susceptible to electromagnetic interference and environmental factors such as water damage and corrosion, which are common causes of service disruptions in areas experiencing heavy monsoons, particularly in regions like Assam or Kerala. This translates to fewer outages and a more stable internet connection for subscribers.", "normalised": "Secondly, F T T H boasts superior reliability compared to copper infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "However, the widespread adoption of FTTH in India faces several challenges. The high initial capital expenditure associated with laying fiber optic cables, especially in densely populated urban areas like Delhi and Kolkata, remains a significant hurdle. Right-of-way issues, regulatory complexities, and the need for skilled manpower also pose obstacles to rapid deployment. Cost remains a key factor for many Indian households, particularly in rural areas. While plans may start at Rs. 699 per month, the upfront installation costs can be a deterrent.", "normalised": "However, the widespread adoption of F T T H in India faces several challenges.
