{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) represents a significant advancement in telecommunications infrastructure, moving beyond traditional copper wire solutions to deliver high-speed internet directly to residential premises. This technology utilizes optical fiber cables to transmit data, offering vastly superior bandwidth and reliability compared to legacy systems. In India, the adoption of FTTH is rapidly accelerating, driven by increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications such as streaming video, online gaming, and cloud-based services.", "normalised": "fiber to the home (F T T H) represents a significant advancement in telecommunications infrastructure, moving beyond traditional copper wire solutions to deliver high speed internet directly to residential premises. this technology utilizes optical fiber cables to transmit data, offering vastly superior bandwidth and reliability compared to legacy systems. in india, the adoption of F T T H is rapidly accelerating, driven by increasing demand for bandwidth intensive applications such as streaming video, online gaming, and cloud based services."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the growing popularity of FTTH in the Indian context. Firstly, the rising penetration of smartphones and internet-enabled devices, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities like Lucknow and Patna, fuels the need for robust and reliable internet connectivity. Secondly, government initiatives like the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all gram panchayats with high-speed broadband, are creating a conducive environment for FTTH deployment. This project envisages connecting over 2.5 lakh village panchayats across India.", "normalised": "several factors contribute to the growing popularity of F T T H in the indian context. firstly, the rising penetration of smartphones and internet enabled devices, especially in tier two and tier three cities like lucknow and patna, fuels the need for robust and reliable internet connectivity. secondly, government initiatives like the bharatnet project, aiming to connect all gram panchayats with high speed broadband, are creating a conducive environment for F T T H deployment. this project envisages connecting over two point five lakh village panchayats across india."}
{"unnormalised": "Private sector players, including Reliance Jio, Airtel, and BSNL, are also investing heavily in FTTH infrastructure. Reliance Jio, for instance, has aggressively rolled out its JioFiber service, offering competitive pricing and bundled services. These investments are critical in expanding the reach of FTTH to a wider customer base, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi. The cost of deployment remains a challenge, especially in areas with difficult terrain or pre-existing infrastructure. The deployment of one km of fiber can cost around Rs. 25,000 - Rs. 50,000, depending on the terrain.", "normalised": "private sector players, including reliance jio, airtel, and B S N L, are also investing heavily in F T T H infrastructure. reliance jio, for instance, has aggressively rolled out its jiofiber service, offering competitive pricing and bundled services. these investments are critical in expanding the reach of F T T H to a wider customer base, particularly in densely populated urban areas like mumbai and delhi. the cost of deployment remains a challenge, especially in areas with difficult terrain or pre existing infrastructure. the deployment of one kilometer of fiber can cost around rupees twenty five thousand to rupees fifty thousand, depending on the terrain."}
{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH extend beyond just faster internet speeds. It offers improved reliability, reduced latency, and the capacity to support future technological advancements, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 8K video streaming. Moreover, FTTH infrastructure is less susceptible to interference and degradation compared to copper wires, resulting in a more consistent and dependable internet experience.", "normalised": "the benefits of F T T H extend beyond just faster internet speeds. it offers improved reliability, reduced latency, and the capacity to support future technological advancements, such as the internet of things (I O T) and eight K video streaming. moreover, F T T H infrastructure is less susceptible to interference and degradation compared to copper wires, resulting in a more consistent and dependable internet experience."}
{"unnormalised": "From an educational perspective, institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) are actively researching and developing advanced technologies related to optical fiber communication and FTTH deployment. These efforts contribute to improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of FTTH networks in the Indian context.", "normalised": "from an educational perspective, institutions like the indian institute of technology (I I T) are actively researching and developing advanced technologies related to optical fiber communication and F T T H deployment. these efforts contribute to improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of F T T H networks in the indian context."}
{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain in realizing the full potential of FTTH in India. These include the need for streamlined regulatory approvals, efficient management of right-of-way permissions, and skilled manpower for installation and maintenance. Overcoming these hurdles will be crucial for accelerating the widespread adoption of FTTH and bridging the digital divide. Just like the characters seeking connection in Bollywood films like \"Dil Chahta Hai,\" Indians are seeking seamless digital connection and FTTH is a critical step towards achieving that goal. The industry needs to ensure accessibility and affordability to truly democratize high-speed internet access.", "normalised": "however, challenges remain in realizing the full potential of F T T H in india. these include the need for streamlined regulatory approvals, efficient management of right of way permissions, and skilled manpower for installation and maintenance. overcoming these hurdles will be crucial for accelerating the widespread adoption of F T T H and bridging the digital divide. just like the characters seeking connection in bollywood films like \"dil chahta hai,\" indians are seeking seamless digital connection and F T T H is a critical step towards achieving that goal. the industry needs to ensure accessibility and affordability to truly democratize high speed internet access."}
