{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering a significant upgrade from traditional copper-based infrastructure. FTTH involves the direct deployment of optical fiber cables to individual homes or businesses, enabling the delivery of significantly faster and more reliable internet services. This technology is crucial for supporting the increasing bandwidth demands of modern Indian households, driven by applications such as streaming high-definition video, online gaming, and remote work, all commonplace in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru.", "normalised": "Fiber to the Home (F T T H) technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape in India, offering a significant upgrade from traditional copper-based infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "The advantages of FTTH are numerous. Firstly, it offers vastly superior bandwidth compared to legacy technologies like Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Download speeds of up to 1 Gbps are readily achievable, enabling seamless experiences for multiple users and devices within a single household. Secondly, FTTH provides symmetrical upload and download speeds, which are particularly important for video conferencing and cloud-based applications, critical for businesses operating in the digital age. Thirdly, fiber optic cables are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference, resulting in a more stable and reliable internet connection, a boon for areas prone to power fluctuations like many parts of Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "The advantages of F T T H are numerous.

{"unnormalised": "The Indian government has been actively promoting FTTH deployment through initiatives like the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed broadband. Private players like Reliance Jio and Airtel Digital TV are also aggressively expanding their FTTH networks across the country, investing substantial capital in infrastructure development. For instance, Reliance Jio announced a plan to connect 50 million homes with JioFiber by 31/12/2024. These investments are vital for bridging the digital divide and empowering citizens in both urban and rural areas.", "normalised": "The Indian government has been actively promoting F T T H deployment through initiatives like the BharatNet project, aiming to connect all Gram Panchayats with high-speed broadband.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The high initial cost of deployment, especially in densely populated urban areas and remote rural locations, is a significant hurdle. Right-of-way issues, bureaucratic delays, and a shortage of skilled labor can further impede the rollout process. Moreover, ensuring affordability and accessibility of FTTH services for all sections of society is crucial for equitable development. Tariff plans need to be designed in a way that caters to the diverse economic backgrounds of Indian consumers.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, FTTH is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India. As the demand for bandwidth continues to grow and the cost of deployment decreases, we can expect widespread adoption of FTTH across the country. Initiatives like “Digital India” hinge on reliable connectivity. The successful implementation of FTTH will not only enhance the quality of life for individuals but also drive economic growth and innovation. A meeting to discuss the next phase of BharatNet is scheduled for 14/09/2023 at 10:00 hrs in New Delhi. Further cost reductions of roughly Rs. 500 per connection are anticipated by Q1 2025. The successful completion of projects like laying 5000 km of new fiber in Maharashtra by March 2024 is crucial for realizing India's digital ambitions.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, F T T H is poised to become the dominant broadband technology in India.
