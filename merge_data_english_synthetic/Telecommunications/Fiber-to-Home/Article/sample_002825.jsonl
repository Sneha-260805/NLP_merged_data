{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH), also known as Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP), represents a transformative shift in telecommunications infrastructure, replacing traditional copper or coaxial cables with optical fiber to deliver high-speed internet, television, and voice services directly to individual homes. This technology offers significantly higher bandwidth and improved reliability compared to older infrastructure, paving the way for a future of seamless digital experiences in India.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H), also known as Fiber-to-the-Premises (F T T P), represents a transformative shift in telecommunications infrastructure, replacing traditional copper or coaxial cables with optical fiber to deliver high-speed internet, television, and voice services directly to individual homes.

{"unnormalised": "The demand for FTTH is surging across the nation, fueled by the growing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications like video streaming (think Bollywood movies on demand), online gaming, and cloud computing. From bustling metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns like Meerut, consumers are increasingly demanding faster and more reliable internet connections. This is especially true for households with multiple users and smart home devices, requiring robust connectivity to support simultaneous activities.", "normalised": "The demand for F T T H is surging across the nation, fueled by the growing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications like video streaming (think Bollywood movies on demand), online gaming, and cloud computing.

{"unnormalised": "Several telecom operators, including Reliance Jio, Airtel, and BSNL, are actively expanding their FTTH networks across India. These companies are investing heavily in laying down fiber optic cables, deploying advanced network equipment, and offering attractive subscription plans to entice customers. BSNL, for example, has ambitious plans to connect every gram panchayat with fiber by 2025, a significant undertaking considering the sheer scale of the Indian landscape.", "normalised": "Several telecom operators, including Reliance Jio, Airtel, and B S N L, are actively expanding their F T T H networks across India.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key benefits of FTTH is its symmetrical bandwidth capability. Unlike traditional cable connections that offer much lower upload speeds compared to download speeds, FTTH provides equal download and upload speeds. This is particularly advantageous for activities such as video conferencing, uploading large files (like those wedding videos from your cousin Rajesh's wedding in Jaipur on 10/11/2023), and backing up data to the cloud. Imagine quickly sharing those precious family moments!", "normalised": "One of the key benefits of F T T H is its symmetrical bandwidth capability.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, FTTH networks are less susceptible to interference and degradation than copper-based networks. This translates to more stable and reliable internet connections, even during peak hours or adverse weather conditions like the Mumbai monsoons. The increased reliability is crucial for businesses operating from home and for accessing vital online services, such as e-healthcare and online education.", "normalised": "Furthermore, F T T H networks are less susceptible to interference and degradation than copper-based networks.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain in the widespread deployment of FTTH in India. The initial infrastructure costs are substantial, requiring significant investment in digging trenches, laying cables, and installing network equipment. Regulatory hurdles, such as obtaining permits and approvals, can also slow down the rollout process. Maintaining the network, addressing customer service issues, and ensuring affordable pricing for all segments of the population are other crucial considerations. Remember that power outage on 05/05/2024 at 14:00 hrs? Such situations requires robust backup solutions.", "normalised": "Challenges remain in the widespread deployment of F T T H in India.
