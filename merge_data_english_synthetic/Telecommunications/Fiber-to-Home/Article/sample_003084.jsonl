{"unnormalised": "The rollout of FTTH in India is being spearheaded by both public and private sector players. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), under the BharatNet project, aims to connect every Gram Panchayat with high-speed broadband. Reliance Jio, Airtel, and other private telecom operators are aggressively expanding their FTTH networks across urban and semi-urban areas, offering competitive bundled packages to consumers. This surge in activity has resulted in a substantial increase in FTTH subscriptions, particularly in metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.", "normalised": "The rollout of F T T H in India is being spearheaded by both public and private sector players.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH are manifold. Firstly, it enables faster download and upload speeds, crucial for households with multiple devices and bandwidth-hungry applications. A family watching a 4K movie on Netflix, while another member is engaged in an online gaming session and someone else is attending a video conference, can all enjoy a seamless experience. Secondly, FTTH is more resilient to electromagnetic interference, resulting in a more stable and reliable internet connection. This is particularly important during the monsoon season, when copper-based connections are prone to disruptions. Thirdly, FTTH offers a future-proof infrastructure, capable of supporting even higher bandwidth demands as technology advances. Experts predict that FTTH will become the de facto standard for broadband connectivity by 2030.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H are manifold.

The initial investment cost of laying fiber optic cables is substantial, particularly in densely populated urban areas and remote rural regions. Obtaining right-of-way permits for digging and installation can also be a time-consuming process. Government initiatives, such as streamlining the permit process and providing financial incentives for FTTH deployment in underserved areas, are crucial to accelerate its adoption. For example, the state government of Maharashtra is offering subsidies for FTTH projects in Vidarbha region, aiming to improve digital inclusion.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of F T T H.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, the future of FTTH in India is bright. With increasing government support, technological advancements, and growing consumer demand, FTTH is poised to revolutionize broadband connectivity across the nation. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a consultation paper on 20/07/2023, outlining recommendations for promoting FTTH deployment. Imagine a future where seamless connectivity enables access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their location. A meeting is scheduled at 11:00 hrs on 10/08/2023 at the Sanchar Bhavan in New Delhi to discuss further infrastructure improvements. The projected investment for FTTH deployment in the next 5 years is estimated at Rs. 50,000 crores, covering approximately 200,000 km of fiber optic cables. The target date for completing the BharatNet project is 15/08/2025.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, the future of F T T H in India is bright.
