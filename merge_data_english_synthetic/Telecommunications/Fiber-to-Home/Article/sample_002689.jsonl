{"unnormalised": "The core principle of FTTH involves running optical fiber cables directly to individual homes or businesses, replacing the older, slower copper wires that often bottleneck internet speeds. This direct fiber connection allows for symmetrical upload and download speeds, crucial for applications like video conferencing, cloud computing, and online gaming. Imagine a family in Chennai simultaneously streaming HD movies, participating in online classes, and working from home – all without buffering or lag. FTTH makes this a reality.", "normalised": "The core principle of F T T H involves running optical fiber cables directly to individual homes or businesses, replacing the older, slower copper wires that often bottleneck internet speeds.

{"unnormalised": "Several telecom operators, including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and BSNL, are aggressively expanding their FTTH networks across India. JioFiber, for example, aims to connect millions of homes with high-speed internet, offering bundled packages that include TV services and voice calls. Airtel Xstream Fiber is another major player, focusing on delivering premium internet experiences in urban areas. The government's \"Digital India\" initiative, launched on 01/07/2015, further incentivizes FTTH deployment through various subsidies and policy support, particularly in rural and underserved regions.", "normalised": "Several telecom operators, including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and B S N L, are aggressively expanding their F T T H networks across India.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH extend beyond faster internet speeds. It also offers greater reliability and stability, as fiber optic cables are less susceptible to interference and degradation compared to copper wires. This translates to fewer service disruptions and a more consistent online experience. Moreover, FTTH infrastructure is future-proof, capable of supporting even higher bandwidth demands as new technologies emerge. We expect a significant upgrade by 2025 to handle the anticipated 8K streaming demands.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H extend beyond faster internet speeds.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The initial cost of deploying FTTH infrastructure is substantial, requiring significant investment in laying fiber cables, installing equipment, and training technicians. The \"Right of Way\" (RoW) approvals for digging and laying cables can also be a lengthy and complex process, delaying deployment timelines. For example, obtaining approvals in certain parts of Kolkata can take up to 6 months. Furthermore, affordability remains a concern for many households, particularly in rural areas where incomes are lower. The average monthly plan could cost anywhere between Rs. 699 and Rs. 2000.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.

{"unnormalised": "Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of FTTH are undeniable. It is a crucial infrastructure investment that will drive economic growth, improve access to education and healthcare, and empower citizens across India. As more homes and businesses embrace FTTH, the country will be better positioned to participate in the global digital economy. Consider the scenario of a budding entrepreneur in a small village in Bihar, able to access global markets and customers through a reliable FTTH connection. That's the power of FTTH. We saw a massive peak in adoption at 14:00 hrs during the COVID-19 lockdown, proving how necessary this has become. Further expansion requires a collaborative effort between telecom operators, government agencies, and local communities to overcome the existing hurdles and ensure that the benefits of FTTH are accessible to all.", "normalised": "Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of F T T H are undeniable.
