{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH), also known as Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP), represents a significant paradigm shift in telecommunications infrastructure, particularly within the dynamic Indian market. Unlike traditional copper-based or hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) networks, FTTH deploys optical fiber directly to individual residences, enabling dramatically faster and more reliable internet speeds. This capability is crucial for supporting the burgeoning demands of bandwidth-intensive applications, including streaming high-definition video, online gaming, and cloud-based services, all increasingly prevalent in homes across India from bustling metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns in states like Uttar Pradesh and Kerala.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H), also known as Fiber-to-the-Premises (F T T P), represents a significant paradigm shift in telecommunications infrastructure, particularly within the dynamic Indian market.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of FTTH is driven by the inherent limitations of older technologies. Copper wires are susceptible to signal degradation over distance, resulting in slower speeds and inconsistent performance. HFC networks, while an improvement, still retain a copper component, thus inheriting some of these drawbacks. FTTH, on the other hand, delivers symmetrical upload and download speeds, ensuring a seamless user experience irrespective of whether one is attending a virtual conference at 14:00 hrs or uploading large files.", "normalised": "The adoption of F T T H is driven by the inherent limitations of older technologies.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors are contributing to the growing momentum of FTTH deployment in India. The government’s Digital India initiative, launched on 01/07/2015, actively promotes the expansion of broadband infrastructure, recognizing its vital role in economic development and social inclusion. Telecom operators, both public sector undertakings (PSUs) like BSNL and private entities such as Reliance Jio and Airtel, are investing heavily in FTTH networks to cater to the rising demand for high-speed internet access.", "normalised": "Several factors are contributing to the growing momentum of F T T H deployment in India.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of deployment remains a significant hurdle. Laying fiber optic cables, especially in densely populated urban areas with existing infrastructure, can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, securing right-of-way permissions from local authorities can often be a protracted process. Nevertheless, the long-term benefits of FTTH, including its scalability and future-proof nature, outweigh the initial investment.", "normalised": "The cost of deployment remains a significant hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, initiatives like BharatNet aim to connect all 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats with high-speed internet, relying heavily on FTTH technology. This initiative, slated for completion by 31/12/2025, has the potential to bridge the digital divide and bring the benefits of the digital age to rural communities. The investment required for such a project is substantial, estimated in the thousands of crores of Rupees, but the potential return in terms of economic growth and improved quality of life for millions of Indians is undeniable.", "normalised": "Moreover, initiatives like BharatNet aim to connect all two point five lakh Gram Panchayats with high-speed internet, relying heavily on F T T H technology.
