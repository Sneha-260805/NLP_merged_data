{"unnormalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH), also known as fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), represents a significant advancement in telecommunications infrastructure, delivering broadband internet access directly to individual residences using optical fiber. Unlike traditional copper-based technologies like DSL or coaxial cable, FTTH offers significantly higher bandwidth, lower latency, and improved reliability, paving the way for enhanced digital experiences for consumers across India.", "normalised": "Fiber-to-the-Home (F T T H), also known as fiber-to-the-premises (F T T P), represents a significant advancement in telecommunications infrastructure, delivering broadband internet access directly to individual residences using optical fiber.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of FTTH is gaining momentum across urban and rural areas alike. Major players in the Indian telecommunications sector, including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and BSNL, are actively investing in expanding their fiber optic networks. This expansion is driven by increasing demand for high-speed internet for streaming video, online gaming, video conferencing, and supporting the growing number of internet-of-things (IoT) devices in Indian homes. For instance, families in Mumbai relying on seamless video calls with relatives in Chennai at 14:00 hrs require robust bandwidth, something FTTH readily provides.", "normalised": "The adoption of F T T H is gaining momentum across urban and rural areas alike.

{"unnormalised": "The benefits of FTTH extend beyond mere entertainment and communication. It facilitates e-governance initiatives, enabling citizens to access government services online, participate in virtual consultations, and benefit from improved healthcare through telemedicine. Educational institutions, from IIT Delhi to local schools in smaller towns like Kanpur, can leverage FTTH to provide students with access to online learning resources, virtual classrooms, and collaborative research platforms.", "normalised": "The benefits of F T T H extend beyond mere entertainment and communication.

{"unnormalised": "However, the deployment of FTTH also faces challenges in India. The cost of laying fiber optic cables, particularly in densely populated urban areas and geographically challenging rural terrain, remains a significant barrier. Obtaining right-of-way permissions from local authorities can also be a lengthy and complex process. Furthermore, ensuring affordable access to FTTH services for economically disadvantaged communities remains a crucial consideration.", "normalised": "However, the deployment of F T T H also faces challenges in India.

{"unnormalised": "The Government of India is actively promoting FTTH deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, which aims to connect all gram panchayats in the country with high-speed broadband. The government's target is to reach a substantial number of rural households by 31/12/2024. Incentives and subsidies are being offered to telecom operators to encourage them to expand their FTTH networks, especially in underserved areas. A report released by TRAI on 26/01/2023 highlighted the increasing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) observed in FTTH segments, indicating the willingness of consumers to pay for superior broadband experiences.", "normalised": "The Government of India is actively promoting F T T H deployment through various initiatives, including the BharatNet project, which aims to connect all gram panchayats in the country with high-speed broadband.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, FTTH is poised to play a pivotal role in transforming India's telecommunications landscape. With ongoing investments, supportive government policies, and increasing consumer demand, FTTH is expected to drive economic growth, improve digital literacy, and empower individuals and communities across the nation. The expectation is that by 2027, the FTTH penetration rate will be significantly higher than the current levels, enabling a truly digitally connected India. In areas like Kashmir, fiber connectivity is seen as a game changer, allowing businesses to thrive and providing access to global markets at 09:00 hrs.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, F T T H is poised to play a pivotal role in transforming India's telecommunications landscape.
