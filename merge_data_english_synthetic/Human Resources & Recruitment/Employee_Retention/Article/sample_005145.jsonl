{"unnormalised": "Employee retention isn't merely about preventing attrition; it's about cultivating a loyal, engaged, and productive workforce. Losing an experienced employee can cost a company a significant amount, estimated to be between 1 to 2 times the employee's annual salary, considering recruitment costs, training investments, and the loss of institutional knowledge. Consider, for instance, the impact of losing a seasoned software engineer from a Bangalore-based IT firm at 15:00 hrs on 26/01/2024. The immediate disruption to ongoing projects and the subsequent scramble to find a replacement can be substantial.", "normalised": "Employee retention isn't merely about preventing attrition; it's about cultivating a loyal, engaged, and productive workforce.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, open and transparent communication is essential. Employees should feel comfortable sharing their concerns with management and should be actively involved in decision-making processes. Regular employee surveys and town hall meetings can provide valuable insights into employee sentiment and identify areas for improvement. A cultural fit is also critical; ensuring that the company’s values align with those of its employees. Imagine an employee joining from IIM Ahmedabad only to discover the organization has a rigid, hierarchical structure. This mismatch can lead to dissatisfaction and eventual departure.", "normalised": "Furthermore, open and transparent communication is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, conducting thorough exit interviews can provide invaluable information about why employees are leaving. Analyzing the feedback gathered from these interviews can help organizations identify systemic issues and implement targeted solutions. Remember that a successful employee retention strategy is an ongoing process, requiring constant evaluation and adaptation. On 15/08/2023, many companies started implementing 'stay interviews' as opposed to solely relying on exit interviews, focusing on why employees choose to remain, rather than reasons for leaving. Investing in your employees is ultimately an investment in the long-term success of your organization.
