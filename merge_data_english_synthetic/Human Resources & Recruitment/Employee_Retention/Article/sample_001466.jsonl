{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, effective employee retention is an ongoing process that requires a holistic approach. It's not a one-time fix but rather a continuous effort to cultivate a positive and supportive work environment where employees feel valued, respected, and empowered to grow. Failure to prioritize this leads to increased recruitment costs (averaging Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 Lakhs per hire), reduced productivity, and a decline in morale.
