{"unnormalised": "Finally, don't underestimate the power of recognition. A simple \"thank you\" or a public acknowledgement of a job well done can go a long way. Consider implementing employee of the month programs or awarding performance-based incentives like gift vouchers worth Rs. 5000. Little gestures like celebrating work anniversaries or offering small gifts can significantly boost employee morale. A satisfied employee is more likely to stay, and the taste of Biryani shared during a team lunch can be just the right ingredient to a good work culture. Investing in employee retention is not just a cost-saving measure; it's an investment in the future success of the organization.", "normalised": "Finally, don't underestimate the power of recognition.
