{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition. Compensation, while important, is often not the sole driver. Career growth opportunities, or the lack thereof, are a significant concern, especially for ambitious individuals entering the workforce from prestigious institutions like the IITs. A clear career path, opportunities for upskilling through programs, and access to mentorship from experienced leaders are vital. Workplace culture also plays a crucial role. A toxic environment, characterized by poor communication, lack of recognition, or unfair treatment, will inevitably lead to increased turnover. Furthermore, work-life balance, particularly in demanding sectors like IT and finance, is increasingly valued. Employees want flexibility and support to manage their personal lives alongside their professional responsibilities. Many are now evaluating roles based on this, especially after seeing the remote work possibilities that started in March 2020.", "normalised": "several factors contribute to employee attrition. compensation, while important, is often not the sole driver. career growth opportunities, or the lack thereof, are a significant concern, especially for ambitious individuals entering the workforce from prestigious institutions like the I I T s. a clear career path, opportunities for upskilling through programs, and access to mentorship from experienced leaders are vital. workplace culture also plays a crucial role. a toxic environment, characterized by poor communication, lack of recognition, or unfair treatment, will inevitably lead to increased turnover. furthermore, work-life balance, particularly in demanding sectors like I T and finance, is increasingly valued. employees want flexibility and support to manage their personal lives alongside their professional responsibilities. many are now evaluating roles based on this, especially after seeing the remote work possibilities that started in march two thousand and twenty."}

{"unnormalised": "It's imperative to measure and monitor employee retention rates regularly. Track key metrics such as attrition rates, employee satisfaction scores, and the reasons for employee departures. Analyze this data to identify trends and areas for improvement. Exit interviews conducted at 14:00 hrs on 22/07/2024, for instance, can provide valuable insights into the factors driving attrition. Analyze feedback from performance reviews scheduled for 10/11/2024 and surveys completed by 31/12/2024. This data-driven approach enables HR professionals to make informed decisions and tailor their retention strategies to address the specific needs of their organization. Remember, investing in employee retention is an investment in the long-term success of the company and will boost the 'make in India' initiative, rather than losing talent overseas. Ignoring this aspect could cost a company easily Rs. 50,000 per employee lost.", "normalised": "it's imperative to measure and monitor employee retention rates regularly. track key metrics such as attrition rates, employee satisfaction scores, and the reasons for employee departures. analyze this data to identify trends and areas for improvement. exit interviews conducted at two P M on twenty second july two thousand and twenty four, for instance, can provide valuable insights into the factors driving attrition. analyze feedback from performance reviews scheduled for tenth november two thousand and twenty four and surveys completed by thirty first december two thousand and twenty four. this data-driven approach enables H R professionals to make informed decisions and tailor their retention strategies to address the specific needs of their organization. remember, investing in employee retention is an investment in the long-term success of the company and will boost the 'make in India' initiative, rather than losing talent overseas. ignoring this aspect could cost a company easily rupees fifty thousand per employee lost."}
