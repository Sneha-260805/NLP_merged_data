{"unnormalised": "One key factor influencing retention is compensation and benefits. While competitive salaries are essential, especially in bustling metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Bangalore, organizations should also consider offering comprehensive benefits packages. This could include health insurance covering family members, provident fund contributions, gratuity, and performance-based bonuses. In a country where family plays a central role, benefits that extend to dependents are often highly valued.", "normalised": "One key factor influencing retention is compensation and benefits.
