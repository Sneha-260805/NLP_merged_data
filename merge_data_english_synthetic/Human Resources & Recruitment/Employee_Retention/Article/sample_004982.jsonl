{"unnormalised": "Employee retention is no longer a luxury but a strategic imperative in the dynamic Indian business environment. The 'Great Resignation' ripples continue to be felt, especially in high-demand sectors like IT, Finance, and even traditional manufacturing hubs like Coimbatore. Replacing a skilled employee can cost anywhere between 50% to 200% of their annual salary, taking into account recruitment, onboarding, and lost productivity – a figure no organisation can afford to ignore.", "normalised": "Employee retention is no longer a luxury but a strategic imperative in the dynamic Indian business environment.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to the leaky talent pipeline. Competitive salaries, of course, remain a key driver. Companies in Gurgaon and Bangalore are constantly vying for top talent, often offering significant pay hikes to lure employees away. However, compensation is only one piece of the puzzle. Opportunities for growth and development are equally, if not more, important, especially for Gen Z and Millennial employees. They crave challenging assignments, skills training, and clear career progression pathways. A dead-end job, even with a decent salary of Rs. 8,00,000 per annum, won't hold them for long.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to the leaky talent pipeline.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond salary and growth, the work environment plays a crucial role. A toxic work culture, characterized by micromanagement, lack of appreciation, or unfair treatment, can quickly drive employees to seek greener pastures. Companies need to foster a culture of inclusivity, respect, and open communication. Regular feedback sessions, employee engagement surveys, and initiatives promoting work-life balance are essential. Remember the famous dialogue from \"3 Idiots\" – \"Kaabil bano, kamyabi jhak marke piche aayegi\" (Become capable, success will chase you). This applies to organisations too – focus on nurturing talent, and retention will improve organically.", "normalised": "Beyond salary and growth, the work environment plays a crucial role.
