By investing in employee development, fostering a positive work environment, and demonstrating genuine appreciation for their contributions, organizations can significantly improve retention rates and build a stable and productive workforce that contributes to long-term success in the competitive Indian market. Compensation packages are no longer the only consideration; many seek work-life balance and a sense of purpose.
