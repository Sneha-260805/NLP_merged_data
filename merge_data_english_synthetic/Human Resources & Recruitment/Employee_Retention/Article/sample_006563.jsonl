{"unnormalised": "Several factors influence employee decisions to stay or leave an organization in India. Compensation and benefits packages are undeniably important. Employees, particularly those in high-demand fields like IT and finance, are constantly evaluating their remuneration against industry benchmarks. Organizations in metros like Mumbai and Bangalore often need to adjust salaries to account for the higher cost of living, sometimes offering Rs. 50,000 or more as a relocation bonus.
