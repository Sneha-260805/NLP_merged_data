{"unnormalised": "The costs associated with employee turnover are multifaceted. Replacing an employee involves recruitment costs (advertising, agency fees, screening), onboarding expenses (training, documentation), and the loss of institutional knowledge. Moreover, there's a period of reduced productivity as the new employee gets acclimated to the role and the company culture. A study conducted in Mumbai showed that replacing a mid-level manager can cost an organization approximately 1.5 to 2 times the employee's annual salary. This burden is especially felt by SMEs based in cities like Pune and Bangalore, who often struggle to compete with the compensation packages offered by larger multinational corporations.", "normalised": "The costs associated with employee turnover are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to attrition in the Indian workforce. Competitive salary packages offered by rival companies are a primary driver. Employees, especially those with in-demand skills, are often lured away by better pay and benefits. Another significant factor is the lack of opportunities for career growth and development within the organization. If employees feel stagnant, they are more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere. Work-life balance, especially for employees juggling family responsibilities, is also crucial. Long working hours and a demanding work environment can lead to burnout and ultimately, attrition. Many IT professionals in Chennai, for instance, cite poor work-life balance as a reason for leaving their jobs.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to attrition in the Indian workforce.
