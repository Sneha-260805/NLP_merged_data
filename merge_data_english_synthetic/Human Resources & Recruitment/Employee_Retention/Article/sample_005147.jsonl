{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition. While salary is a significant consideration, especially for junior level employees, many individuals, particularly those with 5+ years of experience, prioritize factors such as career development opportunities, work-life balance, and a positive work environment.

{"unnormalised": "Effective employee retention strategies go beyond annual appraisals conducted on 31/03 each year. They require a holistic approach, focusing on building a culture of appreciation and growth. This includes implementing robust training programs, offering mentorship opportunities with senior leaders, like a seasoned VP at Reliance Industries, and providing avenues for employees to upskill. Regular feedback sessions, not just during the formal review cycle, are crucial. Encourage open communication and create a safe space where employees can voice their concerns and suggestions without fear of retribution. Imagine Mr. Sharma, a team lead in TCS, scheduling a quick 15-minute catch-up with each team member every Friday at 09:30 hrs to address any roadblocks they might be facing.", "normalised": "Effective employee retention strategies go beyond annual appraisals conducted on thirty first March each year.
