High attrition rates can be a significant drain on resources, impacting productivity, morale, and ultimately, the bottom line. Finding and training new talent is expensive, costing upwards of Rs. 50,000 per employee in some sectors, not even factoring in the lost productivity during the transition period.", "normalised": "In today's dynamic Human Resources and Recruitment landscape, particularly in a rapidly growing economy like India, employee retention is no longer a desirable perk but a critical business imperative.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India. Competitive salaries are undoubtedly a key aspect. Companies in cities like Bangalore and Gurgaon, where the IT sector thrives, are constantly vying for the same talent pool, leading to a salary inflation.
