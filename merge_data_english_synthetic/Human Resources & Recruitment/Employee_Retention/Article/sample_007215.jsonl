{"unnormalised": "One key factor contributing to employee retention in India is work-life balance. The modern Indian workforce, increasingly tech-savvy and globally aware, demands flexibility and autonomy. Companies offering remote work options, flexible hours, and generous leave policies are better positioned to attract and retain top talent. This is particularly crucial for women in the workforce, allowing them to balance their professional and personal responsibilities more effectively.", "normalised": "One key factor contributing to employee retention in India is work-life balance.

{"unnormalised": "Just as Raj, from the Bollywood film \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,\" went to great lengths to win over his beloved’s family, employers must proactively work to win over and retain their employees. Employee retention is not a one-time fix but a continuous process that requires commitment, creativity, and a genuine desire to create a positive and supportive work environment. A Rs. 5 Lakh yearly training budget, for example, can provide employees with invaluable skills and improve retention. Ignoring these factors will invariably lead to a loss of talent, impacting the bottom line and the overall success of the organization. Building a strong company culture in Bengaluru or Bhopal depends on this commitment.", "normalised": "Just as Raj, from the Bollywood film \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,\" went to great lengths to win over his beloved’s family, employers must proactively work to win over and retain their employees.
