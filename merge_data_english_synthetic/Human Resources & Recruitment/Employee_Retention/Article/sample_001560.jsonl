{"unnormalised": "One key aspect of effective retention is understanding the 'why' behind employee departures. Exit interviews are crucial, providing insights into areas where the organization falls short. Did Priya from the marketing team leave because of limited growth opportunities? Did Rohan from the finance department cite lack of work-life balance as his reason for leaving on 26/01/2023? Analyzing these patterns allows HR to identify systemic issues and implement targeted solutions. For example, if several employees mention inadequate training, investing in upskilling programs or mentorship initiatives can address the concern.", "normalised": "One key aspect of effective retention is understanding the 'why' behind employee departures.

Encouraging employees to voice their concerns and suggestions creates a sense of ownership and belonging. Establishing employee resource groups, focusing on diversity and inclusion initiatives, can foster a more equitable and supportive workplace.
