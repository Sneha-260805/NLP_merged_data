{"unnormalised": "One of the key factors influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits. While not the sole determinant, a competitive salary package that aligns with industry standards and reflects the employee's skills and experience is essential. Furthermore, benefits such as health insurance, Provident Fund (PF), gratuity, and Employee State Insurance (ESI) contribute significantly to employee satisfaction and loyalty. Regular salary revisions and performance-based incentives, such as bonuses tied to meeting targets, can also play a crucial role. For instance, after the Diwali bonus announcements on 20/10/2023, many companies saw a noticeable uptick in employee morale.", "normalised": "One of the key factors influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits.

{"unnormalised": "Another important aspect is work-life balance. The demanding work culture in India can often lead to burnout and stress. Organizations are increasingly recognizing the need to offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options and flexible timings, to help employees manage their personal and professional lives effectively.
