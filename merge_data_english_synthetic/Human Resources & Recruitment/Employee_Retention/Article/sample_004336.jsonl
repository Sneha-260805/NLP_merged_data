{"unnormalised": "Firstly, competitive compensation and benefits packages are crucial. While salary is not the sole driver of retention, it remains a significant factor, especially for junior and mid-level employees. Organizations should regularly benchmark their compensation structures against industry standards and ensure they are offering fair and competitive salaries. Benefits packages should also be tailored to cater to the diverse needs of employees, including health insurance, retirement plans, and childcare support. For example, a company located in Mumbai might consider providing transportation allowances or assistance with housing, given the high cost of living.", "normalised": "Firstly, competitive compensation and benefits packages are crucial.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, fostering a positive and supportive work environment is crucial. A company culture that promotes open communication, teamwork, and recognition can significantly improve employee morale and reduce attrition. Leaders should be trained to provide constructive feedback, empower their teams, and create a sense of belonging. Work-life balance is also a key consideration, especially in a country where family values are highly cherished. Offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options or compressed workweeks, can help employees better manage their personal and professional lives. Remember the old Bollywood adage from the film \"3 Idiots\": “Pursue excellence, and success will follow.\" Similarly, create an environment where employees feel valued and supported, and retention will naturally improve.", "normalised": "Thirdly, fostering a positive and supportive work environment is crucial.

By addressing the key factors that drive attrition and creating a positive and supportive work environment, organizations in India can attract and retain top talent, ensuring long-term success. Addressing these concerns might require investments of Rs. 50,000- Rs. 2 Lakh per employee, but the return on investment in terms of reduced attrition and increased productivity will be significant.
