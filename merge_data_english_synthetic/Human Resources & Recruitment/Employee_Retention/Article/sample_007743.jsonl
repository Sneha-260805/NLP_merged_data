{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India. Competitive salaries are undoubtedly a key driver, with employees often seeking better compensation packages elsewhere. However, compensation is just one piece of the puzzle. Opportunities for professional growth and development are equally important. Employees, especially millennials and Gen Z, seek roles that offer learning opportunities, skill enhancement, and clear career progression paths. Companies that invest in training programs, mentorship initiatives, and cross-functional projects are more likely to retain their talent.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India.

{"unnormalised": "Work-life balance is another significant consideration. The demanding work culture prevalent in many Indian companies can lead to burnout and attrition. Companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of promoting a healthy work-life balance through flexible working arrangements, generous leave policies, and wellness programs. Furthermore, a positive and inclusive work environment is crucial. Employees want to feel valued, respected, and appreciated for their contributions.

{"unnormalised": "Recognition and rewards play a vital role in boosting employee morale and motivation. Simple gestures of appreciation, such as acknowledging a job well done or celebrating team achievements, can go a long way in fostering loyalty.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, regularly analyzing employee turnover data is crucial for identifying trends and patterns. Understanding the reasons why employees are leaving can help organizations tailor their retention strategies accordingly. Implementing exit interviews and conducting stay interviews (conversations with current employees to gauge their satisfaction and identify areas for improvement) are valuable tools for gathering insights. For example, if the data shows a high turnover rate among employees with 2-3 years of experience, the organization might need to re-evaluate its career progression opportunities for this group. Focusing on these aspects can improve retention rates significantly, saving companies lakhs of Rs. in recruitment and training costs and ensuring business continuity.", "normalised": "Finally, regularly analyzing employee turnover data is crucial for identifying trends and patterns.
