A talented software engineer, Rohan Sharma, resigns after just 18 months, citing better career prospects and a higher salary at a competitor. Replacing Rohan not only costs the company approximately 1.5 times his annual salary, but also delays the launch of a critical new app feature, potentially impacting revenue projections for the next quarter. This is a microcosm of the challenges faced by companies across India, from IT hubs like Hyderabad to manufacturing powerhouses like Pune.", "normalised": "Consider a hypothetical scenario at a tech startup in Bangalore.

By prioritizing employee satisfaction and investing in robust retention strategies, Indian businesses can build a strong and loyal workforce, driving sustainable growth and success in the long run.
