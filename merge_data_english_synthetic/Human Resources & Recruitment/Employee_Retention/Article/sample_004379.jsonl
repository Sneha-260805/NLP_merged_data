{"unnormalised": "One crucial aspect is competitive compensation and benefits packages. While salary remains a key motivator, Indian employees increasingly value comprehensive benefits, including health insurance (especially important in the current climate), retirement plans like the EPF, and opportunities for professional development. Regular performance appraisals and transparent promotion policies, conducted fairly and consistently, are also essential for demonstrating that employees are valued and have a clear path for advancement within the organization. Imagine a software engineer at TCS, tirelessly working on a project since 10/01/2023, feeling undervalued because his contributions haven't been recognized during the annual review in March 2024. This can easily lead to disengagement and a search for alternative employment.", "normalised": "One crucial aspect is competitive compensation and benefits packages.

{"unnormalised": "Effective communication is also vital. Regular town hall meetings, feedback sessions, and open-door policies can help build trust and ensure that employees feel heard and valued. HR should actively solicit feedback from employees and act on it promptly. For example, a survey conducted on 26/01/2024, by an Infosys team, revealed a need for better training programs. Addressing this concern promptly can significantly improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition.", "normalised": "Effective communication is also vital.

Providing opportunities for employees to enhance their skills and knowledge not only improves their performance but also demonstrates that the company is invested in their long-term growth. This could include sponsoring employees to attend conferences, providing online courses, or offering mentorship programs within the organization. Consider a recent graduate from IIT Delhi joining a startup; providing them with mentorship from a senior engineer for, say, 2 hours every week starting at 09:00 hrs, can dramatically improve their onboarding experience and increase their likelihood of staying with the company long-term.", "normalised": "Furthermore, investing in employee development and training is crucial.
