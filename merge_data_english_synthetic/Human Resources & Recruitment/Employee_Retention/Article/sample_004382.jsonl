{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India. Attractive opportunities from multinational corporations, particularly in sectors like IT and Finance located in cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, often lure talent away. Furthermore, younger generations entering the workforce, such as Gen Z, often prioritize work-life balance and career development opportunities, making them more likely to seek alternative employment if their needs aren't met.
