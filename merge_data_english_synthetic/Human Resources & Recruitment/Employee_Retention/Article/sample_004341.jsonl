Similarly, companies need to move beyond standardized HR practices and focus on individual employee needs and aspirations to foster a strong sense of loyalty and commitment. A proactive approach to employee retention, informed by data analytics and a deep understanding of employee motivations, is critical for sustainable growth and success in the dynamic Indian business environment.

Addressing attrition can ultimately save significant amounts, perhaps in the range of Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 per employee depending on the role and level. Moreover, consider the 500 km distance an employee might have to commute if they leave and find a job further away - such factors are important.", "normalised": "Recall the iconic film \"Three Idiots,\" where Rancho questions the rote learning approach in engineering colleges, highlighting the importance of fostering genuine interest and passion.
