{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to attrition in India. Opportunities abound, especially for skilled professionals in sectors like IT, finance, and manufacturing. Companies in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Chennai are constantly vying for top talent. Compensation, while crucial, isn't the sole driver. Employees increasingly seek opportunities for professional growth, work-life balance, and a sense of purpose. A toxic work environment, lack of recognition, and limited career progression opportunities are significant push factors. Consider the example of Rahul Sharma, a software engineer who left his previous company, XYZ Tech Solutions, on 20/10/2023 because he felt stagnant despite consistent good performance reviews.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to attrition in India.
