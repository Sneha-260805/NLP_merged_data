{"unnormalised": "One key element is competitive compensation and benefits. Companies in India are increasingly benchmarking their salary structures against industry standards to ensure they offer attractive packages. Benefits like comprehensive health insurance (including coverage for dependents), retirement plans, and performance-based bonuses are becoming increasingly common.

Many companies now offer Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) to attract and retain top talent, especially in the tech sector.
