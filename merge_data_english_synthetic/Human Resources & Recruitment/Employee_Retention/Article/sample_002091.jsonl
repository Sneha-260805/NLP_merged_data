{"unnormalised": "In today's dynamic business environment, particularly within India, employee retention has evolved from a mere HR function to a critical strategic imperative. Companies are realizing that a revolving door of talent not only impacts productivity but also severely dents profitability. Losing experienced employees means losing institutional knowledge, client relationships built over time, and valuable training investments. The cost of replacing an employee can easily run into several months' salary, encompassing recruitment, onboarding, and training expenses, not to mention the dip in overall team morale.", "normalised": "In today's dynamic business environment, particularly within India, employee retention has evolved from a mere H R function to a critical strategic imperative.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in India. Competitive salary packages offered by multinational corporations and burgeoning startups lure talent away. A lack of growth opportunities within the current organization is another major reason. Employees, especially millennials and Gen Z, are actively seeking roles that provide continuous learning, skill development, and avenues for career advancement. Inadequate recognition and appreciation for hard work also play a significant role. A simple “thank you” or a public acknowledgement of a job well done can go a long way.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in India.

This includes promoting a healthy work-life balance, offering flexible work arrangements where possible, and investing in employee well-being programs. Consider celebrating festivals like Diwali or Onam with employees, sharing sweets and creating a sense of community.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, exit interviews are a valuable source of information. Conduct thorough exit interviews to understand why employees are leaving and use this feedback to identify areas for improvement within the organization. Analyze trends and patterns to proactively address underlying issues. By actively listening to employees and implementing necessary changes, organizations can significantly improve their employee retention rates and build a loyal and productive workforce. For example, if several employees from the Bangalore office cite long commute times (45 km daily) as a factor, consider offering transportation assistance or encouraging remote work options. Investing even Rs. 5,000 per employee per month in transportation could be a worthwhile investment to retain valuable talent.", "normalised": "Finally, exit interviews are a valuable source of information.
