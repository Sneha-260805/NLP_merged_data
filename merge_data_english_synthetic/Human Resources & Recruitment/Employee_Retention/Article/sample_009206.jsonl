{"unnormalised": "One key factor influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits. While salary remains a significant motivator, a comprehensive benefits package encompassing health insurance (especially crucial considering the rising cost of private healthcare), retirement plans like EPF, and other perks such as paid time off, transportation allowances (particularly in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore struggling with traffic), and childcare support can significantly enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty. Many Indian companies are now experimenting with performance-linked incentives and stock options to retain top talent, especially in high-growth sectors.", "normalised": "One key factor influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits.
