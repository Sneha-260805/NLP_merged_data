{"unnormalised": "In India, factors influencing employee retention are multifaceted. Compensation, of course, plays a significant role. While competitive salaries are a must, benefits packages, performance-based bonuses, and opportunities for career advancement are equally important. Consider the employee working at a tech firm in Bangalore expecting annual appraisals around Diwali, October 25th, 2024, to align with the festive spirit and provide a boost during the celebrations. Beyond monetary benefits, recognition and appreciation for a job well done are crucial. A simple \"thank you\" from a manager or a public acknowledgment of achievements can go a long way in boosting morale and fostering a sense of belonging.", "normalised": "In India, factors influencing employee retention are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Work-life balance is another key consideration. The demanding nature of many jobs, coupled with the pressures of family life, can lead to burnout and attrition. Offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options or flexible timings like starting at 09:00 hrs instead of the traditional 08:00 hrs, can help employees better manage their personal and professional responsibilities. Companies based in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, where commuting can be incredibly time-consuming, need to be particularly mindful of this aspect.", "normalised": "Work-life balance is another key consideration.
