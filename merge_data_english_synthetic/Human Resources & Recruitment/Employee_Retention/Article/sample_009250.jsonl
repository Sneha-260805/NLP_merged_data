{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in India. These include competitive salary packages offered by rival firms, limited growth opportunities within the current organization, a lack of work-life balance, and a perceived absence of recognition.

Providing opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill through internal training programs or external certifications, perhaps focused on AI or data analytics, shows a commitment to their professional growth.
