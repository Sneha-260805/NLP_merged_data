{"unnormalised": "The costs associated with employee turnover are substantial. Consider a scenario: when a software developer leaves Infosys, the company incurs expenses related to recruitment (advertising, agency fees), onboarding (training, paperwork), and lost productivity while the position remains vacant. A 2023 study by NASSCOM estimated that replacing a skilled IT professional can cost anywhere between 1.5 to 2 times their annual salary.

This could involve performance-based bonuses, promotions, or even simple gestures like acknowledging achievements in team meetings.
