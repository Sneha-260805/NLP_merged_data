{"unnormalised": "Employee retention, a critical concern for HR professionals globally, takes on unique dimensions within the Indian context. A high attrition rate can significantly impact productivity, profitability, and overall organizational health, especially considering the competitive talent market across sectors like IT, manufacturing, and even traditional industries like textiles in places like Surat.
