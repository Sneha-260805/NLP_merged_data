While competitive salaries are essential, employees are increasingly valuing holistic benefits packages that address their personal and familial needs. This includes robust health insurance plans (covering family members), paid time off for festivals like Diwali and Holi, and even options like employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). Performance-based bonuses are also highly effective.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, understanding the cultural nuances of the Indian workforce is crucial. Factors such as family responsibilities, career aspirations, and social expectations play a significant role in employee satisfaction. Companies that are sensitive to these aspects and offer flexible work arrangements, such as work-from-home options or adjusted working hours to accommodate travel during festivals, are more likely to retain their employees. This could include, for instance, allowing an employee from a village near Kanpur to take an extended leave of absence for a family event. The HR team might also consider offering transportation assistance to and from work, especially for employees commuting from distant suburbs, perhaps at 09:00 hrs daily.", "normalised": "Furthermore, understanding the cultural nuances of the Indian workforce is crucial.
