{"unnormalised": "One key aspect of employee retention is a strong organizational culture. In India, where family and community play significant roles, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie is paramount. Team-building activities, celebrations of festivals like Diwali and Holi, and opportunities for social interaction can significantly boost morale. Companies like Infosys have long recognized this, investing heavily in employee engagement initiatives.

{"unnormalised": "Competitive compensation and benefits packages are also essential. While salary is undoubtedly a factor, it's not the only driver.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial element is recognizing and rewarding employee contributions. A simple \"thank you\" can go a long way, but more formal recognition programs, such as \"Employee of the Month\" awards or performance-based bonuses, can be incredibly motivating. Ensuring fair and transparent performance evaluations is vital to maintaining trust and preventing resentment. Promotion opportunities and career growth pathways must be clearly defined and accessible to all deserving employees. A talent management review held on 15/11/2023 at 14:00 hrs is intended to address this.", "normalised": "Another crucial element is recognizing and rewarding employee contributions.
