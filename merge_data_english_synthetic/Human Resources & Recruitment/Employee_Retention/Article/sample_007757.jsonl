{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in India. Compensation and benefits packages are often a primary driver.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond compensation, career development opportunities play a crucial role. Employees crave opportunities for growth, learning new skills, and advancing within the organization. A lack of perceived growth prospects can lead to stagnation and ultimately, a desire to seek opportunities elsewhere. HR departments should actively implement mentorship programs, skill-enhancement workshops, and clearly defined career paths to address this concern. Investing in employee training programs, even for short durations, can demonstrate a commitment to their professional advancement.", "normalised": "Beyond compensation, career development opportunities play a crucial role.
