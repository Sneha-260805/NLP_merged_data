{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India. While compensation remains a key driver, especially in sectors like IT and manufacturing located in hubs like Bangalore and Chennai, it’s not the sole determinant. Employees are increasingly seeking opportunities for career growth, skill development, and a positive work-life balance. Companies that fail to provide these opportunities often see their talented workforce migrate to greener pastures. Furthermore, workplace culture plays a significant role. A toxic or unsupportive environment, characterized by poor management or lack of recognition, can drive even the most well-compensated employees away.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to employee turnover in India.
