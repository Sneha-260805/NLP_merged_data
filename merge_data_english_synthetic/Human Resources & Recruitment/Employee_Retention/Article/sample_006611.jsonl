{"unnormalised": "High employee turnover impacts productivity, increases recruitment costs (advertisements, onboarding, training – all contributing to significant financial burdens), and can negatively affect team morale. Retaining experienced employees not only safeguards institutional knowledge but also fosters a more stable and productive work environment. Imagine losing a senior software engineer from Infosys after they've spent years mastering a legacy system – the impact on project timelines can be substantial.", "normalised": "High employee turnover impacts productivity, increases recruitment costs (advertisements, onboarding, training – all contributing to significant financial burdens), and can negatively affect team morale.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in the Indian context. Competitive salaries and benefits packages are, of course, paramount. Employees are increasingly savvy and aware of market rates, and companies must ensure they are offering competitive compensation to attract and retain talent. Performance appraisals conducted rigorously and fairly are also critical. Employees deserve recognition for their contributions and constructive feedback for improvement. Consider the situation of Priya Sharma, a marketing executive in Mumbai. If her performance is consistently exceeding expectations, but she isn't adequately rewarded, she might start looking at opportunities with rival firms.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in the Indian context.

Employees want to feel that their skills are being honed and that they are progressing in their careers.

{"unnormalised": "Work-life balance is another significant consideration, particularly for millennial and Gen Z employees. Companies that prioritize employee well-being and offer flexible working arrangements, such as remote work options or flexible hours (perhaps allowing some employees to shift their start time from 09:00 hrs to 10:00 hrs), are more likely to retain their employees. Companies need to be sensitive to the challenges faced by employees, such as commuting in congested cities like Bangalore.", "normalised": "Work-life balance is another significant consideration, particularly for millennial and Gen Z employees.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, creating a positive and inclusive work culture is essential. Employees want to feel valued, respected, and connected to their colleagues. Companies that foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for social interaction are more likely to retain their employees. This could involve celebrating Indian festivals like Diwali or Holi together or organizing team-building activities. It's not just about hitting targets; it’s about fostering a feeling of \"belonging\".", "normalised": "Furthermore, creating a positive and inclusive work culture is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing the challenge of employee retention requires a holistic approach. Regular employee surveys, exit interviews (conducted preferably within 30 days of departure), and data analysis can provide valuable insights into the reasons why employees are leaving. On 15/08/2023, the HR team at Wipro held a crucial meeting to analyse attrition data from Q2. Based on this data, targeted interventions can be implemented to address specific areas of concern. Finally, the HR department should not ignore the role of leadership in employee retention. Leaders who are supportive, communicative, and empowering are more likely to create a positive work environment and retain their employees. The next leadership training module is slated for 26/01/2024. Ensuring fair treatment of all employees, regardless of caste, creed, or gender, is also vital. For instance, implementing robust policies against workplace harassment and discrimination as per the POSH Act is non-negotiable.", "normalised": "Addressing the challenge of employee retention requires a holistic approach.
