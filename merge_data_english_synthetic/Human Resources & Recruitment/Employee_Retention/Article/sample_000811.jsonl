{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic landscape of Indian business, employee retention has emerged as a paramount concern for Human Resources and Recruitment departments.

{"unnormalised": "Retaining valuable employees requires a multifaceted approach. Competitive compensation, of course, remains a key factor. Salary benchmarks need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted, taking into account the cost of living in cities like Mumbai or Chennai and the market demand for specific roles. Companies should also consider offering performance-based bonuses, Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and other financial incentives to reward loyalty and dedication. Many firms now conduct compensation reviews quarterly, like the one scheduled for 15/12/2024 at 14:00 hrs at Infosys Bangalore, to stay ahead of the curve.", "normalised": "Retaining valuable employees requires a multifaceted approach.

Providing robust training programs, mentorship opportunities, and clear career progression pathways can significantly boost employee engagement and reduce turnover. For instance, internal leadership development programs offered by Tata Steel have a proven track record of retaining top talent. Flexible working arrangements, such as remote work options or flexible timings, can also be highly appealing, especially for employees juggling family responsibilities.

A positive online presence, active participation in industry events, and strong employee testimonials can all contribute to a compelling employer brand. Many Indian firms, like Reliance Industries, allocate considerable Rs. 5 Cr annually to branding initiatives.
