The Great Resignation, while perhaps less pronounced than in Western economies, has still spurred significant churn, particularly amongst younger professionals seeking better opportunities and work-life balance. Ignoring retention strategies can lead to a revolving door of talent, incurring substantial costs in recruitment, training, and lost productivity.", "normalised": "employee retention is a critical challenge for H R departments across india, impacting productivity, profitability, and overall organizational success.

{"unnormalised": "A robust retention strategy begins with a deep understanding of employee needs and motivations. Competitive compensation remains a key factor, especially in rapidly growing sectors like IT and e-commerce. While monetary benefits are crucial, they are not the sole determinant. Indian employees increasingly value factors such as career growth opportunities, recognition, and a supportive work environment. Regular performance reviews, conducted with constructive feedback and clearly defined career paths, can significantly boost morale and commitment. Imagine Rohan, a software engineer at a Bangalore-based startup, feeling undervalued because his contributions haven't been acknowledged since he joined on 15/08/2022. A timely promotion or even a formal acknowledgment of his achievements could have prevented his decision to seek opportunities elsewhere.", "normalised": "a robust retention strategy begins with a deep understanding of employee needs and motivations.

{"unnormalised": "Investing in employee development is another essential component of a successful retention strategy. Offering training programs, mentorship opportunities, and opportunities to upskill can demonstrate a company’s commitment to employee growth. For instance, a marketing executive at a Mumbai-based FMCG company might be more likely to stay if the company sponsors her participation in a digital marketing course at IIM Ahmedabad. Such investments showcase a commitment to employee's professional development and allow them to enhance their skills, benefiting both the individual and the organization.", "normalised": "investing in employee development is another essential component of a successful retention strategy.

Implementing these changes based on this feedback demonstrates that the company values employee input and is committed to creating a better work environment. The deadline for implementing new feedback strategies based on recent exit interviews is 30/09/2024.", "normalised": "finally, exit interviews are a valuable tool for understanding why employees are leaving and identifying areas for improvement.
