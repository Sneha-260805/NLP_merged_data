{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to employee attrition in the Indian context. Competitive salaries, career growth opportunities, and a positive work culture consistently rank high on the list.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond career advancement, fostering a positive and inclusive work environment is equally vital. This includes promoting open communication, recognizing employee contributions, and addressing concerns promptly and effectively. A culture that values work-life balance, acknowledges cultural sensitivities, and supports employee well-being is more likely to retain its workforce. Offering flexible work arrangements, where feasible, can also contribute to improved employee satisfaction, particularly for employees with family responsibilities. Imagine a young mother working in Mumbai, for whom hybrid work options can be a game-changer.", "normalised": "Beyond career advancement, fostering a positive and inclusive work environment is equally vital.

{"unnormalised": "Performance management systems play a critical role. Regular performance appraisals, constructive feedback, and clear goal setting are essential. However, appraisals should not be solely focused on performance metrics; they should also provide opportunities for career discussions and development planning.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, exit interviews are a valuable tool for gathering feedback and identifying areas for improvement. Analyzing the reasons why employees are leaving can provide valuable insights into the organization's strengths and weaknesses. This information can then be used to develop more effective retention strategies. For instance, if several employees cite limited growth opportunities as their reason for leaving, the company might need to re-evaluate its career development programs. Effective retention strategies require a holistic approach, addressing both tangible factors like compensation and intangible factors like culture and employee well-being. It's an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adaptation to the evolving needs of the workforce.", "normalised": "Finally, exit interviews are a valuable tool for gathering feedback and identifying areas for improvement.
