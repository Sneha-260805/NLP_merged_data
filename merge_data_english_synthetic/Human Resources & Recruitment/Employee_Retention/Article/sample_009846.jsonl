{"unnormalised": "Firstly, **competitive compensation and benefits packages** remain fundamental. While salary isn't everything, it’s a significant factor. Regular salary reviews, performance-based bonuses, and comprehensive benefits like health insurance (covering family members), retirement plans, and even subsidized childcare can make a significant difference.
