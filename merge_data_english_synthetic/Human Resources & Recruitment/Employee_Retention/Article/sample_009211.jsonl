{"unnormalised": "Employee retention, the ability of an organization to retain its employees, is a crucial metric in Human Resources & Recruitment. In the Indian context, characterized by a dynamic job market and a growing emphasis on employee well-being, effective retention strategies are more vital than ever.

{"unnormalised": "One of the primary factors influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits. Competitive salaries are essential, particularly for skilled professionals in sectors like IT and finance. However, beyond the base salary, employees also value benefits packages that cater to their needs, such as health insurance, retirement plans (like the NPS), and paid time off, including festival leave – deeply ingrained in the Indian cultural calendar. Organizations like TCS and Infosys, recognized for their robust HR practices, consistently benchmark their compensation against industry standards to attract and retain talent.", "normalised": "One of the primary factors influencing employee retention in India is compensation and benefits.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond monetary compensation, the work environment plays a significant role. Employees, especially the younger generation, seek opportunities for professional growth, skill development, and meaningful work. Companies offering training programs, mentorship initiatives, and internal mobility options are more likely to retain their employees. In this regard, performance management systems must be transparent and fair, providing regular feedback and opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, fostering a culture of recognition and appreciation is crucial. A simple \"thank you\" or public acknowledgement of good work can go a long way in boosting morale and loyalty.", "normalised": "Beyond monetary compensation, the work environment plays a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "The role of the manager is paramount in employee retention. Managers must be equipped with the skills to effectively coach, mentor, and motivate their teams. They must also be sensitive to the individual needs and aspirations of their team members. A toxic work environment, often stemming from poor management practices, is a major driver of attrition. Think of the cutthroat corporate world depicted in Bollywood films; while often exaggerated for dramatic effect, they highlight the importance of ethical leadership and a supportive workplace culture.", "normalised": "The role of the manager is paramount in employee retention.
