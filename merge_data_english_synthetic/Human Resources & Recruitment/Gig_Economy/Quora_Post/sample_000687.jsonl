{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma from IIM Ahmedabad argues that the gig economy offers benefits like flexibility and cost-effectiveness. However, challenges remain, including compliance with labour laws, ensuring data security (especially in areas like fintech near Nariman Point, Mumbai, where confidentiality is paramount), and mitigating risks associated with worker misclassification.

Moreover, building a sense of community and loyalty amongst gig workers presents another significant HR hurdle. Managing background checks, especially for remote workers across 29 states, is also challenging.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma from I I M Ahmedabad argues that the gig economy offers benefits like flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
