{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest challenges is around talent acquisition. How do we attract top talent for short-term projects when they might prefer the stability of a permanent role at, say, an Infosys or TCS? Employer branding becomes crucial.

We need to embrace new models of work and find ways to make the gig economy beneficial for both companies and workers. This includes developing fair compensation models, providing adequate training and support, and fostering a sense of community among gig workers.
