{"unnormalised": "Is the gig economy a sustainable solution for India, or does it exacerbate existing inequalities? On one hand, it offers flexibility for both organizations and individuals. Companies can access specialized talent for specific projects without the overhead of full-time employees. Individuals, like young graduates from IIT Madras or seasoned professionals in Bangalore seeking better work-life balance, can pursue diverse opportunities and control their schedules. We see examples of this in content creation, IT support, and even in specialized fields like financial modeling where consultants command hefty Rs. per hour.", "normalised": "Is the gig economy a sustainable solution for India, or does it exacerbate existing inequalities?

For instance, providing access to subsidized healthcare or facilitating training programs could address some concerns. Also, the rise of co-working spaces (like those springing up rapidly in Mumbai's Bandra area, offering 5000 sq ft offices) indicates the growing infrastructure supporting gig workers. Dr. Sharma at IIM Ahmedabad has done some interesting research on the impact of gig work on the attrition rate of full-time employees.
