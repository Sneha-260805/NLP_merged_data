{"unnormalised": "On one hand, the gig economy provides access to a wider talent pool. Imagine, a Mumbai-based startup needing expertise in Telugu scriptwriting can easily access freelancers in Hyderabad, without the overhead of permanent hiring. This flexibility is invaluable for project-based work or when specialized skills are required for a limited time. Furthermore, it can be cost-effective, potentially reducing expenditure on benefits and long-term employee commitments (e.g., Gratuity, PF, etc.). For example, a Chennai-based company might hire a freelancer for a 6-month project at Rs. 50,000/month, saving significantly compared to a permanent employee earning Rs. 70,000/month plus benefits.", "normalised": "On one hand, the gig economy provides access to a wider talent pool.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing a gig workforce also presents hurdles. Ensuring compliance with labour laws, maintaining data security (especially with sensitive client information), and fostering a sense of belonging and engagement among gig workers can be difficult. Consider the challenge of onboarding a team of 20 freelancers scattered across India, each working from different locations (from small villages to sprawling metropolises of 500 sq km) and using their own devices.", "normalised": "However, managing a gig workforce also presents hurdles.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the lack of long-term loyalty can be a concern. Companies need to invest in robust project management strategies and knowledge transfer mechanisms to mitigate the risk of knowledge loss when a gig worker moves on. The challenge also lies in background verifications and ensuring that standards of academic institutions like IITs are maintained. HR departments must adapt their policies and practices to effectively manage this evolving workforce, ensuring fair compensation, clear communication, and adequate support to both permanent employees and gig workers. Dr. Sharma's research at IIM Bangalore sheds further light on these complexities. The future of work is here, and HR must be ready to navigate its nuances.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the lack of long-term loyalty can be a concern.
