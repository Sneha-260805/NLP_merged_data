Their insights will be crucial in developing best practices for managing a gig-based workforce fairly and effectively. H R departments need to adapt their recruitment strategies to attract top talent in the gig space, offering competitive remuneration (e.g., rupees fifty thousand per project or rupees two thousand per hour) and benefits, while also clearly defining project scope and expectations. This includes addressing issues like Provident Fund implications and potential concerns surrounding job security. The next five years will be critical in shaping the future of work in India, as we navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by the growing gig economy."}
