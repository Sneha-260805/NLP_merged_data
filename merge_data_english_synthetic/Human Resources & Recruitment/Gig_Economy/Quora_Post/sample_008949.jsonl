Building a robust pipeline of skilled gig workers, perhaps leveraging online platforms and freelance marketplaces, is essential. HR needs to ensure fair compensation (Rs. 50000 per month for a data analyst is a starting point) and adequate insurance coverage, even for short-term assignments. The demand for office space, even for temporary teams, might also require adjustments, perhaps necessitating collaborative workspaces of 2000 sq ft in area.", "normalised": "From a recruiter's perspective, understanding the gig worker’s motivations is crucial.
