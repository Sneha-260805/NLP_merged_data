Traditional recruitment strategies designed for permanent employees are proving inadequate. We need agile systems to source, vet, and onboard gig workers quickly and efficiently. Companies are increasingly using online platforms and specialized agencies to find talent with niche skills for specific projects.

Institutions like I I M Ahmedabad are conducting research on this very topic, exploring the long-term implications for workforce planning and talent acquisition. Companies are offering project-based pay, ranging from rupee five thousand to rupee fifty thousand, depending on the skill and timeline. Companies like T C S and Infosys are experimenting with hybrid models, blending full-time employees with a gig workforce."}
