{"unnormalised": "**Question: How is the gig economy reshaping HR and recruitment practices in India?**", "normalised": "This shift impacts several key H R functions. Firstly, talent acquisition needs to become more agile, leveraging online platforms and networks to quickly identify and onboard gig workers with niche skills, be it a data scientist in Bangalore or a content writer familiar with Hindi literature. Background checks and verification processes must be streamlined but remain robust to mitigate risks."}

Traditional annual appraisals are less relevant for short-term engagements. H R needs to develop metrics and tools to assess the performance of gig workers based on deliverables and project outcomes. This could involve gathering feedback from stakeholders like Mister Sharma in the marketing department."}

Ignoring this trend could lead to a talent crunch, as organizations lose out on accessing a vast pool of skilled professionals, potentially even requiring dedicated workspace measuring one hundred square feet per consultant if they are on site. Doctor Patil's research from I I T Delhi provides valuable insights in this area. Companies in Mumbai and Chennai are actively embracing these changes."}
