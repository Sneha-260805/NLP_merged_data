Adapting and embracing these changes will be key for companies to remain competitive and attract top talent, be it permanent or on a project basis. The traditional HR model needs to evolve from managing employees within the 9-to-5, 1000 sq ft office space to managing a fluid, dynamic workforce distributed across geographical boundaries, paid not in fixed monthly Rs., but project by project.
