{"unnormalised": "One of the primary advantages of leveraging the gig economy is access to specialized skills. Instead of hiring full-time employees for niche projects, companies can engage freelancers with specific expertise. For example, a Mumbai-based IT firm might hire a freelance cybersecurity expert from Bengaluru for a short-term project, or a Delhi-based marketing agency might contract a social media consultant from Chennai. This allows companies to tap into a wider talent pool, often at a lower cost, compared to traditional hiring processes involving months of searching, onboarding, and hefty benefits packages.", "normalised": "One of the primary advantages of leveraging the gig economy is access to specialized skills.

{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies must also adapt. Instead of focusing solely on traditional job boards, HR needs to explore online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and specialized Indian portals catering to freelance professionals. Leveraging social media platforms like LinkedIn and building relationships with relevant professional associations can also be highly effective. Furthermore, understanding the motivations of gig workers is essential.
