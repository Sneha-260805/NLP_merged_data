In India, initiatives like the Code on Social Security, 2020, aim to address these issues by extending social security benefits to gig and platform workers. However, effective implementation remains a key concern. HR professionals can play a crucial role in advocating for fair labour practices and promoting ethical gig work models within their organizations.

Some companies are already exploring innovative solutions like providing access to subsidized insurance plans or offering skill development programs to enhance the employability of gig workers. This requires a new mindset and a commitment to building a more inclusive and equitable labour market for all.
