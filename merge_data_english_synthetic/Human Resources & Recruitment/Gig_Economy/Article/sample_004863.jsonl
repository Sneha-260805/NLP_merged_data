{"unnormalised": "One of the primary benefits of the gig economy for employers is access to a wider talent pool. Instead of limiting themselves to local candidates, companies can tap into a nationwide or even global network of skilled individuals. For example, a startup in Chennai developing AI solutions might hire a data scientist from Kolkata on a project basis, paying Rs. 50,000 for a defined scope of work. This allows them to quickly scale their team with specialized expertise without the long-term commitment of a full-time employee.", "normalised": "One of the primary benefits of the gig economy for employers is access to a wider talent pool.
