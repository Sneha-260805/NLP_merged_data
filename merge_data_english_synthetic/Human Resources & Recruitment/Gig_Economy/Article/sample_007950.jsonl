{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant impacts of the gig economy is on talent acquisition. Companies are increasingly turning to platforms like Naukri.com and LinkedIn to source skilled professionals for specific projects, bypassing traditional full-time hiring processes. This allows organizations, especially startups in Bangalore and IT firms in Hyderabad, to access specialized expertise without the commitment of long-term employment. For example, a fintech company based in Mumbai might hire a freelance data scientist for a 3-month project to analyze user behavior data, instead of employing a full-time data scientist. This flexibility is particularly attractive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating with limited budgets. Moreover, the gig economy allows companies to tap into a wider talent pool, including individuals from Tier-II and Tier-III cities like Lucknow and Jaipur, who may be unable or unwilling to relocate for full-time employment.", "normalised": "One of the most significant impacts of the gig economy is on talent acquisition.
