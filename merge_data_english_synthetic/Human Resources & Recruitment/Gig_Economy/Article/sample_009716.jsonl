{"unnormalised": "One key factor fueling this trend is the increasing demand for specialized skills. Companies in sectors like IT, finance, and even manufacturing are realizing that they don't always need a full-time employee with a specific skillset. Instead, they can tap into a pool of talented freelancers for short-term projects, offering cost savings and access to cutting-edge expertise. Think of a Bengaluru-based startup needing a data scientist for a 6-month project – hiring a freelancer is often a more efficient solution than a lengthy and expensive full-time recruitment process.", "normalised": "one key factor fueling this trend is the increasing demand for specialized skills. companies in sectors like I T, finance, and even manufacturing are realizing that they do not always need a full-time employee with a specific skillset. instead, they can tap into a pool of talented freelancers for short-term projects, offering cost savings and access to cutting-edge expertise. think of a Bengaluru-based startup needing a data scientist for a six-month project hiring a freelancer is often a more efficient solution than a lengthy and expensive full-time recruitment process."}
{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies are, therefore, adapting. Traditional job boards are being supplemented by online platforms specifically designed for connecting gig workers with companies.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing a gig workforce also presents unique challenges. HR policies need to be updated to address issues like intellectual property rights, data security, and non-compete agreements for gig workers.

{"unnormalised": "Another aspect to consider is the impact on employee engagement and organizational culture. Integrating gig workers into existing teams and fostering a sense of belonging can be difficult. HR departments need to focus on clear communication, regular feedback, and creating opportunities for gig workers to collaborate with full-time employees. Maybe a virtual team lunch celebrating Onam, with everyone sharing their favourite dish (vegetarian sadhya options appreciated!) could help bridge the gap.", "normalised": "another aspect to consider is the impact on employee engagement and organizational culture. integrating gig workers into existing teams and fostering a sense of belonging can be difficult.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of the gig economy is also impacting salary expectations. While some freelancers command premium rates due to their specialized skills, others may be willing to work for lower pay due to the flexibility and autonomy it offers. HR professionals need to understand these dynamics to ensure fair and competitive compensation packages, keeping in mind the cost of living in cities like Mumbai and Chennai. For specialized roles, expect to pay upwards of Rs. 50,000 per month even for a short-term contract.", "normalised": "the rise of the gig economy is also impacting salary expectations. while some freelancers command premium rates due to their specialized skills, others may be willing to work for lower pay due to the flexibility and autonomy it offers.
