{"unnormalised": "On the opportunities side, the gig economy allows companies access to a wider talent pool. Instead of being limited to candidates within a 50 km radius of their office, organizations can now tap into specialized skills from anywhere in the country, or even the world. This is particularly beneficial for niche roles or projects requiring specific expertise that might be difficult to find locally. Consider a company in Chennai needing a UI/UX designer with expertise in regional language interfaces – the gig economy expands their search beyond the traditional confines of full-time employment.", "normalised": "On the opportunities side, the gig economy allows companies access to a wider talent pool.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing a workforce comprised of gig workers presents unique challenges for HR. Traditional HR practices are often designed for full-time employees, making it difficult to apply them effectively to independent contractors. Issues like performance management, benefits, and training require innovative solutions. For instance, how do you evaluate the performance of a social media manager hired on a project basis, or provide them with opportunities for upskilling?", "normalised": "However, managing a workforce comprised of gig workers presents unique challenges for H R.

{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies also need to adapt. Attracting top gig talent requires a different approach than attracting full-time employees. Companies need to focus on building a strong reputation as a reliable and fair client, offering competitive rates (Rs. 5000 per day is common for many roles), and clearly defining project scope and expectations. Platforms like Naukri.com and LinkedIn are evolving to better cater to the needs of gig workers and employers, but internal processes must also align.", "normalised": "Recruitment strategies also need to adapt.

{"unnormalised": "Another key consideration is fostering a sense of community and belonging among gig workers. While they may not be full-time employees, they are still contributing to the company's success. Initiatives like online forums, regular project updates, and even virtual team lunches can help bridge the gap and build stronger working relationships. Perhaps even a virtual Onam celebration could be organized to boost morale and create a sense of connection.", "normalised": "Another key consideration is fostering a sense of community and belonging among gig workers.

This includes tools for project management, communication, and payment processing. Streamlined onboarding processes are also essential for getting gig workers up to speed quickly and ensuring a smooth integration into the project team. The shift towards the gig economy requires a fundamental rethinking of HR practices, moving towards a more agile and flexible approach that embraces the changing nature of work in India. Just like a good plate of biryani needs the right blend of ingredients, a successful gig economy strategy requires a careful mix of technology, policy, and people management.", "normalised": "Finally, H R departments must invest in technology and systems that can efficiently manage a distributed workforce.
