HR departments, from companies like Tata Consultancy Services to startups in Bangalore, must adapt their recruitment processes to cater to a workforce prioritizing flexibility and autonomy.

Distinguishing between independent contractors and employees is crucial, particularly in light of evolving labour laws.
