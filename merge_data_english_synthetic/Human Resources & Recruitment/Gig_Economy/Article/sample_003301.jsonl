{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant shifts is the evolving definition of the \"employee.\" Traditional recruitment processes, built around full-time, permanent roles, are struggling to keep pace with the demand for specialized skills on a project basis. Consider a Bengaluru-based tech startup needing expertise in blockchain technology for a six-month project. Instead of hiring a full-time employee, they might engage a freelancer through platforms like Upwork or LinkedIn, offering greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness. HR teams need to develop strategies for identifying, onboarding, and managing these contingent workers effectively. Background checks, compliance with labour laws (particularly relevant in India with its diverse state-specific regulations), and ensuring fair compensation become paramount.", "normalised": "one of the most significant shifts is the evolving definition of the \"employee.\" traditional recruitment processes, built around full time, permanent roles, are struggling to keep pace with the demand for specialized skills on a project basis. consider a bengaluru based tech startup needing expertise in blockchain technology for a six month project. instead of hiring a full time employee, they might engage a freelancer through platforms like upwork or linkedin, offering greater flexibility and cost effectiveness. h r teams need to develop strategies for identifying, onboarding, and managing these contingent workers effectively. background checks, compliance with labour laws (particularly relevant in india with its diverse state specific regulations), and ensuring fair compensation become paramount."}
