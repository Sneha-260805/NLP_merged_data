{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges for HR is managing a workforce that is increasingly fragmented. Companies are now employing a mix of full-time employees, part-time staff, and independent contractors, each with different needs and expectations. Recruitment strategies must be tailored to attract gig workers, often emphasizing flexibility, autonomy, and project-based compensation. This necessitates a shift from traditional job descriptions to clearly defined project scopes and deliverables. Consider, for example, a marketing campaign scheduled for launch on 26/01/2024. The company might hire a freelance content writer, a graphic designer, and a social media manager, all working independently but contributing to the same project.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges for H R is managing a workforce that is increasingly fragmented.

{"unnormalised": "Performance management in the gig economy also demands a different approach. Traditional annual appraisals are less relevant for short-term projects. Instead, feedback should be continuous and focused on specific project outcomes. Technology plays a vital role in this process, with platforms providing tools for tracking progress, communicating with freelancers, and providing timely feedback. A project debriefing scheduled at 17:00 hrs on 10/03/2024, for example, could provide valuable insights for future engagements with similar gig workers.", "normalised": "Performance management in the gig economy also demands a different approach.

It allows companies to access a wider talent pool, tap into specialized skills on demand, and scale their workforce quickly to meet fluctuating demands. This is particularly beneficial for startups and SMEs in cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, which often face challenges in attracting and retaining full-time employees with niche expertise. Imagine a Delhi-based AI startup needing a specialist in natural language processing for a specific project.
