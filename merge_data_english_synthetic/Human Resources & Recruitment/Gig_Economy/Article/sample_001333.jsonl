{"unnormalised": "For Indian companies, the gig economy offers several advantages. Access to a wider talent pool becomes significantly easier. A Delhi-based startup looking for a UI/UX designer can now recruit a highly skilled professional from Kerala without geographical constraints. Moreover, cost-effectiveness is a major draw. Companies like TCS and Infosys are known to engage gig workers for specific projects, potentially saving on overhead costs like benefits and office space rent. Consider a project needing specialized data analysis; hiring a freelancer for Rs. 50,000 instead of onboarding a full-time employee costing Rs. 5 Lakhs annually makes sound financial sense.", "normalised": "For Indian companies, the gig economy offers several advantages.

{"unnormalised": "One significant challenge is ensuring compliance with Indian labor laws. Determining whether a gig worker is classified as an independent contractor or an employee impacts tax obligations, benefits eligibility, and other legal considerations.
