{"unnormalised": "One of the key drivers of this trend is the increasing demand for specialized skills. Companies are finding it more cost-effective and efficient to hire experts for specific projects, rather than maintaining a large, permanent workforce. For example, a tech startup in Bangalore might hire a freelance data scientist for a 6-month project, paying a premium but avoiding the long-term commitment and overhead associated with a full-time employee. Similarly, a marketing agency in Chennai might engage several freelance content writers to handle a surge in demand during the festive season, like Diwali.", "normalised": "One of the key drivers of this trend is the increasing demand for specialized skills.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing a gig workforce presents unique challenges. Onboarding processes need to be streamlined to quickly integrate freelancers into project teams. Performance management requires clear expectations and regular feedback, especially given the short-term nature of the engagements. Compliance with labor laws and regulations is also crucial, as freelancers may not be covered by the same protections as full-time employees. Issues like Provident Fund (PF) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI) need careful consideration.", "normalised": "However, managing a gig workforce presents unique challenges.
