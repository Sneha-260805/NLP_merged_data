{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies are evolving to accommodate this new reality. Companies are increasingly leveraging online platforms and social media channels to source gig workers. Instead of traditional full-time hires, HR departments are now focusing on identifying individuals with specific skill sets for defined project scopes. This requires a shift in mindset, focusing on skills-based hiring rather than solely relying on educational qualifications and years of experience.

{"unnormalised": "However, integrating gig workers presents unique HR challenges. Maintaining consistent performance standards across a distributed workforce requires clear communication, well-defined project deliverables, and robust monitoring systems. Compensation strategies also need to be re-evaluated. While gig workers typically command higher hourly rates, they often lack benefits like health insurance and provident fund, which are standard for full-time employees. Companies like Infosys and TCS are piloting programs offering tailored benefits packages to attract and retain high-performing gig workers, addressing this concern.", "normalised": "However, integrating gig workers presents unique H R challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The gig economy isn't just about cost savings; it's about accessing specialized skills quickly and efficiently. Consider a retail chain preparing for the Onam festival rush. They might hire temporary graphic designers, logistics specialists, and customer service representatives on a short-term basis to handle the increased demand. This agility allows businesses to scale up or down quickly based on market needs, a key advantage in today's dynamic environment. HR departments in India need to embrace this change, developing innovative strategies to attract, manage, and retain talent in the evolving gig economy landscape.
