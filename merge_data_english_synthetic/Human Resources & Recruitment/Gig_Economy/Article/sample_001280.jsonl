{"unnormalised": "One of the key challenges for HR is ensuring fair treatment and compliance with labour laws. Determining worker classification (employee vs. independent contractor) is critical, as misclassification can lead to legal repercussions. HR departments also need to be mindful of wage parity and ensure that gig workers receive fair compensation for their services. The long-term impact on social security benefits and retirement planning for gig workers also needs careful consideration. Companies like TCS and Infosys are increasingly experimenting with hybrid models, combining full-time employees with gig workers to optimize resource allocation and manage project costs. The festive season, especially around Onam, often sees a spike in demand for skilled workers in certain sectors like logistics and e-commerce, highlighting the dynamic nature of the gig economy. The future of work is undoubtedly evolving, and HR and recruitment professionals in India must adapt to the realities of the gig economy to remain competitive and attract the best talent.", "normalised": "One of the key challenges for H R is ensuring fair treatment and compliance with labor laws.
