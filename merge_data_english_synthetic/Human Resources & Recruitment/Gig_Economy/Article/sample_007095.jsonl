{"unnormalised": "One key impact is on recruitment strategies. Companies like TCS and Infosys, traditionally reliant on campus recruitment drives focusing on long-term employees, are increasingly leveraging gig platforms to access specialized talent for project-based work. This allows them to scale up or down quickly, avoiding the overhead costs associated with full-time hires.

While freelance workers value autonomy, they might lack the sense of belonging and camaraderie often fostered within a traditional office environment. HR departments are exploring ways to bridge this gap through online communities, virtual team-building exercises, and opportunities for collaborative projects.
