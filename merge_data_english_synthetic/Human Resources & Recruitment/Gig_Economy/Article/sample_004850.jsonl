{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, HR departments in India focused on full-time employment, with elaborate processes for recruitment, onboarding, performance management, and benefits administration. However, the gig economy demands a more agile and flexible approach. Recruitment strategies must now encompass sourcing talent from online platforms like Upwork and Freelancer.in, alongside traditional job boards. Companies are increasingly using AI-powered tools to screen candidates and assess their skills, particularly important when evaluating a diverse pool of gig workers from across India, from Chennai to Kolkata.", "normalised": "Traditionally, H R departments in India focused on full-time employment, with elaborate processes for recruitment, onboarding, performance management, and benefits administration.

{"unnormalised": "This shift presents both opportunities and challenges for HR professionals. On one hand, access to a wider talent pool, including specialized skills that may be expensive or difficult to find in the full-time market, is a significant advantage. Imagine a Delhi-based engineering firm needing expertise in a specific software. They can quickly hire a freelance expert from Bengaluru for a short-term project, rather than hiring a full-time employee. This model also allows companies to scale up or down rapidly based on project demands, optimizing resource allocation.", "normalised": "This shift presents both opportunities and challenges for H R professionals.

Indian labor laws are primarily designed for full-time employment, and adapting them to the gig economy requires careful navigation.
