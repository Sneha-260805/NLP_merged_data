{"unnormalised": "The gig economy, characterized by short-term contracts and freelance work, is fundamentally altering the landscape of Human Resources (HR) and recruitment in India. No longer solely the domain of tech startups in Bangalore, it is permeating diverse sectors from manufacturing in Ludhiana to financial services in Mumbai. This shift presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations aiming to attract and retain talent in an increasingly competitive market.", "normalised": "The gig economy, characterized by short-term contracts and freelance work, is fundamentally altering the landscape of Human Resources (H R) and recruitment in India.

{"unnormalised": "Traditional HR practices, built around long-term employment and structured career paths, are being challenged by the fluidity and flexibility inherent in gig work. Companies are now grappling with issues like compliance with labour laws for gig workers, particularly concerning benefits and social security. The legal framework is still evolving in India; a clear, standardized policy covering areas such as Provident Fund (PF) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI) contributions for independent contractors is urgently needed. The government's initiatives, like the e-Shram portal launched on 26/08/2021, aim to create a national database of unorganized workers, including gig workers, but its effectiveness in providing comprehensive social security remains to be seen.", "normalised": "Traditional H R practices, built around long-term employment and structured career paths, are being challenged by the fluidity and flexibility inherent in gig work.

{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies are also undergoing a transformation. HR departments are moving beyond traditional job boards and embracing online platforms specifically designed for gig workers. These platforms facilitate the matching of skills and projects, enabling companies to quickly source specialized talent for specific needs. For instance, a construction company in Kolkata might hire a freelance structural engineer for a particular project through such a platform, rather than employing a full-time engineer. Skill-based assessments are gaining prominence over degree-based evaluations. Can Mr. Sharma, a freelancer from Delhi, deliver the project to the client's satisfaction and within the deadline of 31/12/2024? That’s the key question driving recruitment decisions.", "normalised": "Recruitment strategies are also undergoing a transformation.

{"unnormalised": "However, managing a distributed workforce composed of gig workers also requires a shift in leadership styles. Building trust and fostering a sense of belonging within a team composed of individuals with varying levels of commitment requires strong communication and clear performance metrics. Project management skills are crucial, and HR needs to implement robust systems for tracking progress and providing feedback. Performance reviews, traditionally conducted annually, need to become more frequent and focused on specific project outcomes. Regular virtual team meetings scheduled for 10:00 hrs every Friday, for example, can help maintain team cohesion.", "normalised": "However, managing a distributed workforce composed of gig workers also requires a shift in leadership styles.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, organizations must consider the ethical implications of relying heavily on gig workers. Fair compensation, transparent contracts, and opportunities for skill development are crucial for ensuring a positive experience for gig workers and maintaining a strong employer brand. Simply offering Rs. 200 per hour without providing any training or opportunities for advancement is not a sustainable or ethical approach. Ultimately, the successful integration of the gig economy into the Indian workforce hinges on a collaborative effort between businesses, policymakers, and HR professionals to create a fair, equitable, and sustainable ecosystem.", "normalised": "Furthermore, organizations must consider the ethical implications of relying heavily on gig workers.
