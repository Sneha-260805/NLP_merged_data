{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, HR departments focused on full-time employees, managing benefits, performance reviews, and long-term career development within the organization. However, the rise of gig workers – from software developers in Bangalore to content writers in Delhi – requires a more flexible and agile approach to talent acquisition and management. Companies are increasingly leveraging the gig economy for specialized skills, project-based work, and to manage fluctuating workloads. Think of a festive season rush where companies need temporary customer service agents, or a specialized AI project that requires expertise not available in-house.", "normalised": "Traditionally, H R departments focused on full-time employees, managing benefits, performance reviews, and long-term career development within the organization.

For individuals like Priya Sharma, a graphic designer from Mumbai, the gig economy offers autonomy, flexible work hours, and the opportunity to diversify her portfolio.

Ensuring compliance with labor laws, managing worker classification (employee vs. independent contractor), and providing adequate social security benefits to gig workers are crucial.

Building trust and fostering a sense of community among gig workers, even if they are not physically present in the office, is vital for maintaining high-quality work.

{"unnormalised": "The gig economy isn't just a temporary trend; it’s a fundamental shift in the way work is done. HR professionals need to embrace this change, develop innovative recruitment strategies, and create supportive environments for both full-time employees and gig workers to thrive. Navigating this new landscape effectively will be key to driving organizational success in the years to come. Addressing issues like providing health insurance at reasonable premiums (say, below Rs. 5000 per year) and ensuring timely payments are critical for gig worker satisfaction and retention. A recent study showed that 65% of gig workers prioritize timely payments over higher pay rates. Companies investing in robust payment systems and clear communication will undoubtedly attract and retain the best freelance talent. Reaching out to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, even those 1000 km away, can further expand the talent pool.", "normalised": "The gig economy isn't just a temporary trend; it’s a fundamental shift in the way work is done.
