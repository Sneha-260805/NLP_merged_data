{"unnormalised": "From an HR perspective, recruiting for the gig economy demands innovative strategies. Traditional methods like campus placements are less effective for attracting individuals who prioritize project-based engagements. Instead, HR departments need to leverage online platforms, social media, and specialized talent marketplaces to connect with skilled gig workers. Background verification also becomes paramount, requiring efficient and reliable systems to assess the credibility and competence of individuals on a project basis. For example, a company hiring a freelance content writer in Bangalore on 22/07/2024 at 14:00 hrs must have processes in place to verify their portfolio and previous client testimonials.", "normalised": "From an H R perspective, recruiting for the gig economy demands innovative strategies.

They must develop the ability to effectively manage remote teams, foster collaboration in a decentralized environment, and measure performance based on project outcomes rather than traditional metrics like hours worked. Implementing robust communication channels and establishing clear expectations are crucial for successful gig-based projects. Suppose a Delhi-based startup hires a marketing consultant on a project basis starting on 10/10/2024; clear communication about project scope, deliverables, and deadlines is paramount for a successful collaboration.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the gig economy necessitates a shift in mindset for H R professionals.
