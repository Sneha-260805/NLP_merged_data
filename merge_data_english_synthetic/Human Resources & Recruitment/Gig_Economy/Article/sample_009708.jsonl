{"unnormalised": "One key area of focus is talent acquisition. Traditional recruitment strategies built for permanent employment models are often ill-suited for sourcing gig workers. HR departments need to develop agile recruitment processes, potentially utilizing online platforms like Naukri.com and LinkedIn more effectively to identify skilled individuals available for project-based work. Background checks and skill verification become even more crucial in this scenario, necessitating robust screening procedures. Consider the case of Priya Sharma, an HR manager at a Mumbai-based startup, who recently revamped their recruitment strategy to include skills assessments tailored for specific gig projects. She noted a 30% reduction in project completion time after implementing the new system.", "normalised": "One key area of focus is talent acquisition.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect is managing compliance. Indian labor laws, primarily designed for full-time employees, often struggle to address the specific needs of gig workers. HR departments must navigate complex legal frameworks related to taxation, insurance, and worker classification. Misclassifying a worker as an independent contractor instead of an employee can lead to significant legal repercussions. Companies must also consider providing access to basic benefits, such as health insurance or paid time off, to attract and retain top gig talent. Even small gestures, like sending Diwali sweets or recognizing contributions publicly, can boost morale and loyalty.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect is managing compliance.

Transparency in compensation is crucial to build trust and ensure fair pay. Moreover, offering performance-based bonuses or incentives can motivate gig workers to deliver exceptional results.
