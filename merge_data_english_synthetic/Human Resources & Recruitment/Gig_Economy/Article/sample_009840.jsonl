{"unnormalised": "For HR professionals, this shift presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional recruitment models focused on full-time employees need significant adjustments. Companies like TCS and Infosys are now exploring platforms to connect with freelancers skilled in niche areas like AI and blockchain, recognizing the scarcity of such talent within traditional employee pools. The focus is shifting towards skill-based hiring rather than role-based hiring. This demands HR to revamp their skill identification and assessment processes.", "normalised": "For H R professionals, this shift presents both opportunities and challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Recruitment strategies must also adapt. Job portals need to incorporate gig-specific filters and profiles. Interviews may become shorter and more focused on demonstrable skills. Background checks also require new methods that consider the temporary and project-based nature of the work. Managing a distributed, non-permanent workforce also requires new HR policies regarding onboarding, performance management, and offboarding.", "normalised": "Recruitment strategies must also adapt.

{"unnormalised": "One key challenge lies in ensuring compliance with labor laws. Unlike full-time employees, gig workers may not be automatically entitled to benefits like Provident Fund (PF) or Employees' State Insurance (ESI). HR departments need to carefully navigate legal frameworks to ensure fair compensation and avoid potential liabilities. The government is exploring amendments to existing laws to address these grey areas, but clarity is still evolving.", "normalised": "One key challenge lies in ensuring compliance with labor laws.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical aspect is building a strong organizational culture when a significant portion of the workforce is transient. Creating a sense of belonging and purpose for gig workers can be challenging. Regular communication, feedback mechanisms, and opportunities for skill development can help mitigate this. Consider, for instance, incorporating gig workers into company-wide events like Diwali celebrations or recognizing their contributions during town halls.", "normalised": "Another critical aspect is building a strong organizational culture when a significant portion of the workforce is transient.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, HR needs to address the skill gap. Many Indians, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities like Lucknow and Patna, possess valuable skills but lack access to gig economy platforms. Initiatives aimed at upskilling and providing digital literacy can help bridge this gap.", "normalised": "Furthermore, H R needs to address the skill gap.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, compensating fairly and recognizing contributions are paramount. Just as a well-prepared plate of biryani satisfies, a good compensation package and appreciation keeps a gig worker engaged and productive. This includes timely payments, performance-based bonuses, and public recognition for successful project completion. The gig economy is not a passing fad; it's a significant shift that requires HR professionals to embrace innovation and adapt their strategies to thrive in this evolving environment. The shift is not a question of 'if' but 'how' it needs to be managed.", "normalised": "Finally, compensating fairly and recognizing contributions are paramount.
