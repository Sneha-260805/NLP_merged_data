{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest shifts is in talent acquisition. Companies are increasingly turning to platforms and online marketplaces to find skilled professionals for specific projects. For instance, a Mumbai-based startup launching a new marketing campaign might hire a freelance social media manager through a platform like Naukri.com or a specialized gig-work website, instead of going through the traditional route of hiring a full-time employee. This allows them access to a wider pool of specialized skills and can be more cost-effective, especially for short-term projects.", "normalised": "One of the biggest shifts is in talent acquisition.
