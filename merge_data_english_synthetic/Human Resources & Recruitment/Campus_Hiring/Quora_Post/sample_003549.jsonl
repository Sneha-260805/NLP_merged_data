It's an ongoing relationship-building exercise that requires continuous engagement and feedback. Don't hesitate to iterate your strategy based on the previous year's results. You can look at organizing coding contests at places like I I T Madras for tech roles or Case Study competitions at S P J I M R for Business roles. Ensuring proper communication and allocating ample space (around five hundred square feet) for interaction with students is key. Doctor Sharma at X L R I Jamshedpur suggests focusing on building a diverse cohort by actively seeking candidates from Tier two and Tier three colleges as well. Good luck!"}
