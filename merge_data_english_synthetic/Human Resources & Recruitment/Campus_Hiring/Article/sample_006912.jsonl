{"unnormalised": "The formal campus recruitment process typically involves several stages. Firstly, a pre-placement talk is delivered, providing students with an overview of the company's culture, operations, and career growth prospects. This is often followed by a written aptitude test, assessing skills like logical reasoning, quantitative ability, and verbal communication. Successful candidates then proceed to technical interviews, often conducted by senior engineers or technical leads, to evaluate their understanding of core concepts and problem-solving abilities. HR interviews are also conducted to assess their personality, cultural fit, and overall suitability for the role.", "normalised": "The formal campus recruitment process typically involves several stages.

Onboarding programs, mentorship initiatives, and continuous learning opportunities are vital for retaining young talent and ensuring their long-term success within the organization. Think of it like preparing a good biryani; the spices (skills) need to be carefully blended, and the rice (employee) needs time to simmer and absorb the flavours (corporate culture) to truly create a dish that is appreciated and lasting. In the same vein, new hires need the right support to fully integrate and thrive. Many organizations also offer signing bonuses ranging from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 Lakh, and relocation assistance (e.g., 2000 km train ticket reimbursement) to attract talent from across India. Companies scheduling campus drives during festive periods like Onam should be mindful of potential disruptions and travel difficulties. Finally, collecting and analyzing campus hiring data is crucial for identifying areas for improvement and optimizing future recruitment strategies.", "normalised": "Post-offer engagement is equally important.
