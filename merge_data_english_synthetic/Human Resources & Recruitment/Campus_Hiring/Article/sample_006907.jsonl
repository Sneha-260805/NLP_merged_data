{"unnormalised": "Finally, track and measure the effectiveness of your campus hiring program. Analyze key metrics such as offer acceptance rates, time-to-fill, and first-year retention rates. Gather feedback from new hires and hiring managers to identify areas for improvement. This data-driven approach will help you optimize your campus hiring strategy and ensure a steady pipeline of talented individuals for years to come. Don't shy away from reporting metrics, for instance, \"Cost per Hire was Rs. 50,000 with an average time-to-fill of 45 days\" to executives. Also remember to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and utilize platforms like LinkedIn and social media to promote your campus hiring initiatives and reach a wider audience. Consider offering relocation assistance of, say, 2000 km and temporary accommodation for students transitioning from colleges in remote locations.", "normalised": "finally, track and measure the effectiveness of your campus hiring program. analyze key metrics such as offer acceptance rates, time to fill, and first year retention rates. gather feedback from new hires and hiring managers to identify areas for improvement. this data driven approach will help you optimize your campus hiring strategy and ensure a steady pipeline of talented individuals for years to come. don't shy away from reporting metrics, for instance, \"cost per hire was rupee fifty thousand with an average time to fill of forty five days\" to executives. also remember to adapt to the ever evolving landscape of technology and utilize platforms like linkedin and social media to promote your campus hiring initiatives and reach a wider audience. consider offering relocation assistance of, say, two thousand kilometer and temporary accommodation for students transitioning from colleges in remote locations."}
