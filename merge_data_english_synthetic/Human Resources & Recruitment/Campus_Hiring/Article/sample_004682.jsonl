{"unnormalised": "A well-structured selection process is essential for identifying the right fit. This generally includes aptitude tests, technical assessments (especially for engineering roles), group discussions, and personal interviews. Psychometric assessments are also gaining popularity, providing insights into candidates' personality traits and behavioral patterns. For example, a candidate interviewing for a software engineering role at a Bangalore-based tech firm might face coding challenges testing their proficiency in Java or Python, followed by behavioral interview questions assessing their teamwork and problem-solving skills. Successful candidates are then offered internships or full-time positions with competitive starting salaries, often in the range of Rs. 4.5 Lakhs to Rs. 15 Lakhs per annum depending on the role and institution.", "normalised": "A well-structured selection process is essential for identifying the right fit.

To address this, companies are investing in comprehensive training programs, often lasting several weeks or months, to bridge the gap between academic learning and on-the-job requirements. For example, TCS conducts intensive training programs for new hires, equipping them with the necessary technical and soft skills.", "normalised": "Moreover, the skills gap remains a significant concern.
