{"unnormalised": "The benefits of utilizing skill assessments are manifold. Firstly, they provide an objective measure of a candidate's abilities, minimizing the potential for bias inherent in subjective interviews. This is particularly important in India, where social biases can inadvertently influence hiring decisions. Secondly, they improve the efficiency of the recruitment process. By filtering out unqualified candidates early on, HR teams can focus their efforts on those who demonstrate the required skills and aptitude. This saves time and resources, especially when dealing with large volumes of applications, a common scenario in India, where job postings can attract thousands of applicants.", "normalised": "The benefits of utilizing skill assessments are manifold.
