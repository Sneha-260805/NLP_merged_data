{"unnormalised": "The benefits of incorporating skill assessments into the recruitment process are manifold. Firstly, they offer objective, data-driven insights into a candidate's capabilities, minimizing the potential for bias in the hiring process. This is especially important in a diverse country like India, where unconscious biases can inadvertently influence hiring decisions. Secondly, assessments help identify candidates who possess the specific skills required for a role, even if their resumes don't explicitly highlight them. A recent graduate from Delhi University, for instance, might not have years of formal experience, but a strong performance on a relevant skill assessment could demonstrate their potential and readiness to contribute.", "normalised": "The benefits of incorporating skill assessments into the recruitment process are manifold.
