{"unnormalised": "While skill assessments offer a standardized way to measure a candidate’s abilities, they often fail to capture the complete picture. For instance, can a timed coding test truly reflect the problem-solving skills of someone who shines under pressure, or someone who needs a bit more time to conceptualize solutions? Also, rote learning which is somewhat unfortunately still prevalent in many Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges in India, can skew results.", "normalised": "While skill assessments offer a standardized way to measure a candidate’s abilities, they often fail to capture the complete picture.

Consider incorporating behavioural interviews, simulations, and even project-based assessments to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a candidate's capabilities. Organizations like IIM-Ahmedabad conduct group discussions and WAT (Written Ability Test) rounds which can give a better sense of how well someone thinks on their feet.", "normalised": "I believe a more holistic approach is needed.
