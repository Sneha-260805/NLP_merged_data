They help evaluate technical proficiency (coding tests, software aptitude), cognitive abilities (problem-solving, critical thinking), and even soft skills (communication, teamwork). Imagine hiring a software developer for TCS based purely on their resume, only to find out their coding skills are below par. Skill assessments prevent such costly mistakes.", "normalised": "Skill assessments provide objective, data-driven insights into a candidate's capabilities, moving beyond subjective impressions.

Dr. Sharma from IIM-Ahmedabad has published research indicating a direct correlation between pre-employment skill assessments and improved employee performance ratings (average 4.2 out of 5). However, it's crucial to select assessments that are relevant to the specific job requirements and validated for the Indian context. Remember, a generic assessment might not accurately reflect a candidate's skills in relation to the realities of working in a 1000 sq ft office in Mumbai. Considering investing Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 100,000 annually on a reputable assessment platform can prove a worthwhile investment in the long run.
