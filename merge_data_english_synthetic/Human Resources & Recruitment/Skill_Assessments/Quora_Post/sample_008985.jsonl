We use them regularly at our company to filter candidates for roles ranging from entry-level programmers to senior project managers. They provide an objective measure of a candidate's abilities, going beyond just a resume and interview performance. Think of it like the rigorous entrance exams I I T uses - they sift out the best, right?"}
