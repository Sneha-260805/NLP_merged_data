A candidate scoring high on a coding test might lack the crucial soft skills necessary for team collaboration, a highly valued trait in Indian workplaces, much like the spirit of 'seva' (service) valued in our culture.", "normalised": "My experience at a Mumbai-based I T firm suggests that while beneficial, skill assessments aren't a silver bullet.

At the end of the day, it's about finding the best fit for the role and the company.", "normalised": "We must ensure assessments are culturally sensitive and adaptable.

A recent project, which involved assessing the impact of skills assessments on productivity, showed a marginal improvement of just 12%, with the average office space used per employee jumping from 60 sq ft to 80 sq ft (partly due to social distancing norms). The cost also factored in at approximately Rs. 500 per assessment. So while the benefits exist, a balanced and thoughtful approach is paramount.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma at I I M Bangalore has conducted interesting research on this; I encourage H R professionals to explore his work.
