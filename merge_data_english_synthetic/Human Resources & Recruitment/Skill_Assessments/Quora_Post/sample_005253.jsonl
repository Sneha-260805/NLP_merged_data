{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the relevance of the assessment to the specific role is paramount. A coding test for a software engineer (e.g., focused on Python or Java) is obviously different from a verbal reasoning test for a marketing executive. For instance, assessing Ms. Priya Sharma for a Marketing role at Tata Consultancy Services requires different tools than assessing Mr. Rajesh Kumar for a Senior Engineering role at IIT Delhi.", "normalised": "Firstly, the relevance of the assessment to the specific role is paramount.

A poorly designed assessment can lead to hiring the wrong candidate and associated costs (e.g., training, lost productivity, re-recruitment).

Ensuring that assessments are available online and accessible to candidates from various geographical locations (e.g., remote areas of Rajasthan) and with different technological capabilities is essential for inclusivity. Cost (Rs.) also plays a role – balancing comprehensive assessments with budgetary constraints is key.", "normalised": "Thirdly, accessibility is vital.

Furthermore, avoid assessments that could be perceived as discriminatory. A well-structured assessment strategy, incorporating these factors, is vital for successful recruitment. The total area of the new TCS campus in Lucknow is 150,000 sq ft, Dr. Meena said; clearly, the talent pool matters to them.", "normalised": "Finally, consider legal and ethical implications.
