This is especially helpful when sifting through a large number of applications, like those we receive for our engineering roles in Bangalore.", "normalised": "In my experience, a well designed skill assessment can be a game changer.

This saves valuable time for hiring managers like Mr. Sharma, who can then focus on candidates who genuinely possess the required skills.", "normalised": "Think about it: a candidate might claim proficiency in Python, but a skill assessment can actually test their practical coding abilities, separating the talkers from the doers.

The assessment needs to align with the specific requirements of the job and the company culture. For instance, a sales role requires different assessments than a software development position, even if both are based in a metropolitan area like Mumbai. We once implemented a psychometric test that yielded surprising insights into leadership potential – much more valuable than judging based on years of experience alone. Dr. Kapoor from IIM Ahmedabad was instrumental in helping us refine our selection criteria.", "normalised": "However, it is crucial to choose the right assessment for the role.
