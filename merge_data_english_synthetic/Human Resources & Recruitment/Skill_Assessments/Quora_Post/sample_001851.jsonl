{"unnormalised": "In terms of quality of hire, well-designed assessments can definitely improve the chances of finding the right fit. For instance, if you're hiring for a software engineer role in Bangalore, assessing proficiency in specific programming languages like Java or Python through coding challenges is far more effective than simply asking about it. This reduces the probability of hiring someone who portrays themselves as a \"3 Idiots\"-style Rancho (a brilliant mind) but lacks practical skills.", "normalised": "In terms of quality of hire, well-designed assessments can definitely improve the chances of finding the right fit.

{"unnormalised": "Regarding time-to-hire, assessments can streamline the process. Pre-employment testing can filter out unsuitable candidates early on, allowing HR to focus on interviewing those who meet the minimum skill requirements. Many companies in Mumbai are now using online platforms for these tests, reducing the logistical challenges. Institutions like IIM Ahmedabad also emphasize the importance of data-driven hiring decisions, recognizing that a thorough assessment process can significantly improve recruitment outcomes. This allows for quicker decision-making and reduced time-to-hire. However, the assessment should be culturally relevant to the talent pool being screened. Simply adopting Western assessment models without consideration for the Indian context can lead to inaccurate results. Furthermore, accessibility to the platform and reasonable internet speeds needs to be considered.", "normalised": "Regarding time-to-hire, assessments can streamline the process.
