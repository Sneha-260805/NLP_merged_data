Even for entry-level positions requiring basic skills like data entry or customer service (proficiency in regional languages), a simple assessment can differentiate between candidates and ensure a better fit, reducing attrition and increasing R O I (Return on Investment) on H R investments (perhaps saving rupees fifty thousand per hire due to reduced turnover)."}
