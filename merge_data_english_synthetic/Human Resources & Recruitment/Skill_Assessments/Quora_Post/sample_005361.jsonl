{"unnormalised": "In today's competitive job market, are skill assessments truly effective tools for HR and recruitment, or just another expensive fad?", "normalised": "From my experience, the answer is a resounding yes, provided they are implemented strategically. A well-designed assessment can offer invaluable insights into a candidate's abilities beyond what a resume or interview can reveal. We've seen firsthand how assessments at our firm, based in Bangalore, helped us identify hidden gems - candidates like Priya Sharma, whose coding skills, revealed through a practical test, were far superior to what her academic record from even a prestigious institution like I I T-Bombay suggested."}

A generic aptitude test won't cut it. The assessment must be tailored to the specific role and the skills required. Think of it like choosing the right weapon in a Bollywood action film - a 'lathi' won't do against a 'rocket launcher'! (Okay, maybe a slightly dramatic analogy!). Also, fairness is paramount. Consider factors like internet access and language proficiency, especially when recruiting from diverse backgrounds. We partner with agencies that offer assessments in multiple languages, including Hindi and Tamil, to ensure inclusivity."}
