{"unnormalised": "In the fiercely competitive Indian job market, especially for roles in booming sectors like IT and finance, skill assessments are increasingly becoming commonplace. But are they truly worth the hype for HR and recruitment professionals?", "normalised": "From my experience working in H R at a mid-sized I T firm in Bangalore, robust skill assessments, when properly implemented, can significantly improve the quality of hire. They offer a more objective measure of a candidate's abilities than relying solely on resumes or traditional interviews. Imagine hiring a junior developer based on their resume saying they know Python, only to find out they struggle with basic loops – a good assessment can filter that out."}

A generic test might not accurately reflect the specific skills needed for the role or even the cultural nuances relevant to an Indian workplace. For example, an assessment focusing heavily on Western project management methodologies might not be the best fit for a team operating under a more hierarchical, familial structure common in many Indian companies. Think of the film “Chak De! India” – even the most skilled hockey players needed to adapt their individual skills to work within a cohesive team."}
