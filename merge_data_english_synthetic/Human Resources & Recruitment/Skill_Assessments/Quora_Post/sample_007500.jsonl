When used judiciously, in conjunction with other evaluation methods, they can enhance the quality and efficiency of the recruitment process. They should be tailored to the specific role and company culture, validated for reliability and fairness, and supplemented with behavioral interviews to assess soft skills. Doctor Sharma from I I M Ahmedabad, for instance, advocates a blended approach incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Remember, a candidate's \"skill score\" on a test is just one data point, it doesn’t represent the individual’s total potential or adaptability to a dynamic environment of one thousand five hundred square feet office space."}
