They provide objective data points beyond a CV and interview, helping to identify candidates with the *actual* skills needed for the role, regardless of their pedigree or connections. Imagine you're hiring a software engineer for a startup in Koramangala – a candidate might have a degree from IIT, but can they *actually* code under pressure? A coding assessment can answer that.", "normalised": "In my experience, a well-implemented skill assessment can significantly improve the quality of hire.
