This approach should focus not only on current skill sets but also on the candidate's learning agility and potential for growth within a specific organizational culture. Incorporating feedback from previous employers like Tata Steel can also be highly beneficial. A well-designed skill assessment strategy should also consider the specific requirements of various roles, from junior engineers to senior managers, especially with deadlines typically falling around the end of the financial year on 31/03. Only then can we ensure we're truly identifying the best talent for our organizations, promoting not just individual success but also organizational growth and innovation.", "normalised": "I believe a more holistic approach is needed, one that combines standardized assessments with behavioral interviews, simulations of workplace scenarios (conducted perhaps around fourteen hundred hours to gauge afternoon performance dip), and even cultural fit evaluations.
