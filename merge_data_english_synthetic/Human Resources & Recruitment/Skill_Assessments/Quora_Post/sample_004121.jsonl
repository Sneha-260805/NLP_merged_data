We use them extensively, of course. From coding tests for that new tech position in Bangalore to aptitude quizzes for entry-level management trainee roles at Mahindra, they’re a cornerstone of the hiring process. But are we truly capturing a candidate’s potential, or are we potentially missing out on brilliant individuals?"}

Priya might not have had access to the same resources as someone who graduated from, say, I I T Bombay. Her coding skills might be self-taught, but her problem-solving abilities could be phenomenal. A rigid, standardized assessment might not accurately reflect that."}

We need to evolve beyond simply measuring technical proficiency. We need assessments that also evaluate creativity, adaptability, and critical thinking – those \"soft skills\" that are often the real differentiators between a good employee and a great one. Remember the movie \"three Idiots\"? The film highlighted the flaws of a purely rote-learning based system. Similarly, our skill assessments need to move beyond rote memorization and test true understanding."}
