But are they really worth the hype, especially considering the Indian context?", "normalised": "On one hand, skill assessments can be invaluable for identifying candidates who genuinely possess the skills listed on their C V s. We've all seen the \"Expert in Excel\" who struggles with a basic VLOOKUP, right? They help mitigate bias and ensure fair evaluation, moving beyond just academic qualifications from, say, I I T Delhi or claims of experience. A well-designed assessment can objectively gauge a candidate's aptitude and practical knowledge. Imagine judging a playback singer solely on their resume, versus actually hearing them sing – similar, isn't it? Like a proper audition, just like Lata Mangeshkar had to undergo back then."}

A generic test may not accurately reflect the specific requirements of a role. Moreover, there's a risk of \"teaching to the test,\" where candidates simply memorize answers without truly understanding the underlying concepts. Also, access to reliable internet and electricity is not one hundred percent guaranteed across the country, especially in Tier-two and Tier-three cities, potentially disadvantaging qualified candidates."}
