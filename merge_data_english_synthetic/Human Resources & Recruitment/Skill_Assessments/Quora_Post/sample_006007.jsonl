But are they truly beneficial, or just another hurdle for job seekers?", "normalised": "Firstly, skill assessments can offer objective data on a candidate's proficiency in specific areas. Whether it's coding skills for an I T role (assessed using platforms like HackerRank) or aptitude for a sales position, these assessments theoretically provide a standardized measure. This can be particularly useful when sifting through a large volume of applicants, especially after events like campus recruitments from I I T Madras or I I M Ahmedabad."}

Are these assessments truly reflective of real-world performance?

Furthermore, the cultural relevance of some assessment tools is questionable."}

Implementing and managing these assessments involves an investment that some smaller businesses might find prohibitive.

Skill assessments should be viewed as one piece of the puzzle, supplementing rather than replacing traditional methods like interviews and reference checks. The key is to choose assessments carefully, ensuring they are relevant, valid, and culturally appropriate. Consider implementing assessment after initial screening completed around sixteen hundred hours on twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four. Results need to be reviewed by nine hundred hours on first February two thousand and twenty four before interviews commence. Finally, remember the spirit of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' – are there viable, locally developed alternatives to these international platforms, and at what cost? This requires careful consideration before finalizing assessments for roles based in India."}
