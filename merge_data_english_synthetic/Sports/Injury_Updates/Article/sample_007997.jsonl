The pacer, sidelined since September with a back injury, is undergoing intensive rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. While initial reports suggested a possible return for the Asia Cup, sources now indicate a more cautious approach. “We are taking it one day at a time.
