{"unnormalised": "Pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah continues his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore after sustaining a lower back stress fracture. Initial reports suggest he’s unlikely to be match-fit for the upcoming Asia Cup, leaving a significant hole in the Indian bowling attack. Doctors are closely monitoring his progress and a definitive timeline for his return remains uncertain. His absence will surely be felt, reminiscent of the void left by Gabbar in *Sholay* when he disappeared – a major blow to the team's morale and firepower. KL Rahul, recovering from a thigh injury sustained during the IPL, is also racing against time to be fit for the same tournament. Sources say he's currently undergoing intensive physiotherapy, clocking in at least 6 hours a day.", "normalised": "Pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah continues his rehabilitation at the N C A in Bangalore after sustaining a lower back stress fracture.
