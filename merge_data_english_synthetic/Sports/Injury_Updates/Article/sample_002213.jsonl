While he has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, a definitive return date remains uncertain. \"We are monitoring Hardik's progress closely,\" stated a BCCI official earlier this week. \"The focus is on ensuring a full recovery rather than rushing him back into action.\" The absence of Pandya is a significant blow to the Indian team, leaving a void in both the batting and bowling departments.
