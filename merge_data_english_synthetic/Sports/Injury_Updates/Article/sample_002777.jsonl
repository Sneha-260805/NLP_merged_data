Here's a roundup of the latest injury updates impacting key players across various sports, from cricket to kabaddi.", "normalised": "In cricket, the news isn't great for the Mumbai Indians. Star batsman, Suryakumar Yadav, is still nursing a wrist injury sustained during a practice session last week. Initial reports suggested a minor sprain, but further assessments revealed a hairline fracture. He's expected to be out for at least four to six weeks, a significant blow to M I's batting order. This puts a question mark on his availability for the initial matches of the Ranji Trophy season as well. The N C A (National Cricket Academy) physios are working closely with him on his rehabilitation program."}

He is currently undergoing rehabilitation at a private facility in Kochi and is expected to return to full fitness in the next couple of months.
