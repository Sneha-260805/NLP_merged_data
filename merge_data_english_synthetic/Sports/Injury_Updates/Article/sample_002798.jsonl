Initial reports suggested a Grade two tear, putting his participation in the upcoming Test series in doubt. Doctor Patil, the B C C I 's chief medical officer, has confirmed that Sharma is undergoing intensive physiotherapy at the National Cricket Academy (N C A) in Bengaluru. A final decision regarding his inclusion in the squad will be made after a fitness test scheduled for December twentieth. Fans will recall a similar situation with Sourav Ganguly back in two thousand and three; Sharma's situation isn't quite as dire, but the team will definitely miss his aggressive batting style at the top of the order. We are hoping he channels his inner \"Don\" from the Bollywood classic and overcomes this hurdle with determination."}
