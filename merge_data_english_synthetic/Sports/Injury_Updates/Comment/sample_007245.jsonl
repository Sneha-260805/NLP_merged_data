{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, any updates on Bumrah? Heard he twisted his ankle during practice on 26/01/2024. Hope he's fit for the series against the Aussies. Any word from the NCA? Last I heard, they were saying he might be out for 2 weeks. Also, what about Hardik after that IPL injury on 15/05/2023 at 17:00 hrs? We really need him back in the team.
