{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, any update on Sharma's hamstring injury? He pulled it during the Ranji Trophy match in Bangalore, remember? Last I heard, Dr. Patel from AIIMS Delhi was looking into it. Hope he recovers soon; we need him for the upcoming series. It's like \"Chak De! India\" out here – we need that fighting spirit! Heard it was a grade 2 tear which can take 4-8 weeks!
