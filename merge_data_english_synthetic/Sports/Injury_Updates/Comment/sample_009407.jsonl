{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, any news on Bumrah's back? Heard it's touch-and-go for the upcoming series. Really hoping he recovers quickly! Maybe some physiotherapy at the NCA? Remember when Yuvi had cancer and still came back like a Sher! Kucch Kucch Hota Hai vibes, no? Fingers crossed for a speedy recovery! Let's hope he's playing for India again soon.
