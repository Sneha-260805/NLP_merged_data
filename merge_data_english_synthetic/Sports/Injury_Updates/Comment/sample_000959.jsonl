{"unnormalised": "Hey, any updates on Dhawan bhai's injury? Hope he recovers soon for the upcoming series. Saw reports he pulled a hamstring during practice. Reminds me of that scene in Chak De! India, when they’re all injured before the big game. Praying it's not too serious, maybe just a strain like 2 weeks max? The NCA physios are top-notch, hopefully they'll have him back in form soon enough. Let's see him smash those sixes back over the boundary rope at Eden Gardens!", "normalised": "Hey, any updates on Dhawan bhai's injury? Hope he recovers soon for the upcoming series.
