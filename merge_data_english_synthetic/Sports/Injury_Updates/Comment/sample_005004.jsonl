Fingers crossed he's back on the field soon. When is the next press conference, anyone know? 24/07? Or is it 25/07 at 14:00 hrs? Let's pray to Lord Hanuman for his speedy recovery so he can smash sixes like in the good old days! Get well soon, Shikhar! By 28/07, hopefully!", "normalised": "Hey guys, any update on Dhawan?
