{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, any news on Jasprit Bumrah's injury? Hope he recovers soon, especially with the World Cup around the corner. Heard Rohan's knee is also troubling him. Dr. Patil mentioned recovery might take 2 weeks. Imagine practicing in that humidity in Chennai! The new stadium there is huge, maybe 200,000 sq ft? Get well soon, both of you! Wishing a speedy recovery with some Haldi doodh and prayers. Hope the BCCI is taking good care; costs like Rs. 50,000 for physio shouldn't be a burden.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, any news on Jasprit Bumrah's injury?
