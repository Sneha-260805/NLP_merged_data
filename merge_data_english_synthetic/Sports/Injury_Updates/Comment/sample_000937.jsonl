Remember how much we needed him during the last World Cup... felt like *Lagaan* all over again! The NCA physios are top-notch, so hopefully, he'll be back bowling those yorkers soon. Fingers crossed for a speedy recovery for all the boys, especially with the upcoming series! Any updates on Hardik's back too? Thanks!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, thanks for the injury updates!
