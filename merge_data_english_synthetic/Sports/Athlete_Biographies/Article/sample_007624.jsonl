His autobiography, \"The Race of My Life,\" chronicles his arduous journey from a traumatized refugee of the Partition in 1947 to becoming the \"Flying Sikh,\" narrowly missing an Olympic medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond cricket and athletics, biographies of athletes from other sports also captivate readers. For example, the story of Mary Kom, the Manipuri boxing champion, showcases her unwavering determination to excel in a male-dominated sport, battling societal prejudices and financial constraints to become a six-time World Champion. Her dedication to training, often logging long hours even during her motherhood, highlights her extraordinary commitment. She started boxing at the Khuman Lampak Sports Complex in Imphal, and has consistently overcome challenges, becoming an inspiration, especially for young girls in North-East India.", "normalised": "Beyond cricket and athletics, biographies of athletes from other sports also captivate readers.

{"unnormalised": "These biographies are not mere accounts of sporting achievements; they are also powerful reflections on the socio-economic contexts that shape athletes' lives. They often delve into the challenges of securing sponsorships, navigating the complexities of sports administration, and maintaining mental fortitude in the face of intense competition. Many athletes, even those reaching international levels, still struggle with basic amenities and adequate training facilities. The biography of P.T. Usha highlights the constraints she faced and still managed to excel on the track, reaching the 400m hurdles final at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.", "normalised": "These biographies are not mere accounts of sporting achievements; they are also powerful reflections on the socio-economic contexts that shape athletes' lives.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, these biographies offer valuable insights into the training methodologies, dietary regimens, and psychological strategies employed by successful athletes. They can serve as a source of motivation and guidance for aspiring athletes, coaches, and sports enthusiasts alike. They also highlight the role of family support and the importance of having dedicated mentors, similar to that of PV Sindhu and her coach Pullela Gopichand, whose impact in developing Sindhu into a world-class shuttler is well-documented. The dedication and discipline shown by these athletes often extend beyond their sporting careers, influencing their personal lives and their contributions to society. A well-crafted biography, therefore, becomes more than just a sports story; it becomes a testament to the human spirit. The autobiography of Major Dhyan Chand, released on 29/08/1952 (his birthday, now celebrated as National Sports Day in India) is another source of inspiration for Indian athletes. His story, a tale of sheer talent honed by relentless practice, continues to motivate generations.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these biographies offer valuable insights into the training methodologies, dietary regimens, and psychological strategies employed by successful athletes.
