{"unnormalised": "From the hallowed grounds of the National Sports Club of India in Delhi to the bustling training academies in Patiala, aspiring athletes embark on journeys filled with rigorous training, unwavering discipline, and often, significant personal sacrifices. Biographies shed light on these often-unseen aspects of their lives. For example, a biography of Mithali Raj, the legendary Indian cricketer, might detail her early days playing gully cricket in Hyderabad, her initial struggles against societal expectations, and her relentless pursuit of becoming one of the greatest batswomen of all time. Such accounts inspire young girls across India to break barriers and chase their dreams, regardless of prevailing norms.", "normalised": "From the hallowed grounds of the National Sports Club of India in Delhi to the bustling training academies in Patiala, aspiring athletes embark on journeys filled with rigorous training, unwavering discipline, and often, significant personal sacrifices.

{"unnormalised": "Similarly, biographies of athletes from lesser-known sports, such as kabaddi or archery, can bring much-needed attention to these disciplines. An account of P.T. Usha's journey from a small village in Kerala to becoming the \"Queen of Indian Track and Field\" after the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, underscores the transformative power of sports and the importance of grassroots development programs. We can read about how she missed out on a bronze medal by a fraction of a second. Or a biography of Milkha Singh, 'The Flying Sikh,' recounting his harrowing experiences during the Partition of 1947 and his subsequent rise to become a track and field icon, serves as a powerful reminder of resilience and the unifying power of sport. The book “The Race of My Life”, showcases how he trained tirelessly under challenging circumstances.", "normalised": "Similarly, biographies of athletes from lesser known sports, such as kabaddi or archery, can bring much needed attention to these disciplines.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, athlete biographies often touch upon the social and political context in which these individuals operate. They may explore issues of caste discrimination, gender inequality, and the lack of access to resources for athletes from marginalized communities. This can be seen in the life of Dhyan Chand, highlighting the societal constraints on hockey during the pre-independence era, and his relentless pursuit of excellence. They can even highlight the political pressure faced by Indian athletes at international events, such as the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
