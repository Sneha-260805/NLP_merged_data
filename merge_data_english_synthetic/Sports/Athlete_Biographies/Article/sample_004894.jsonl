{"unnormalised": "Take, for instance, the hypothetical biography of Priya Sharma, a kabaddi player from Haryana. Her story could begin with her childhood days spent practicing on dusty village grounds, honing her raiding skills against older boys. The biography might detail her rigorous training schedule, waking up at 04:00 hrs to practice before school, and balancing her academic responsibilities with her athletic aspirations. It could explore the societal pressures she faced, challenging traditional expectations of women in her community, and the unwavering support she received from her family, especially her grandfather, a retired wrestler himself.", "normalised": "Take, for instance, the hypothetical biography of Priya Sharma, a kabaddi player from Haryana.

It explores the psychological aspects of competition, the pressure of representing India on the international stage, and the mental strategies athletes employ to overcome adversity. It delves into the impact of coaches, mentors, and teammates who shaped their careers. We might see Priya receiving crucial advice from coach Ramesh Kumar at the National Sports Institute, Patiala, which helped her refine her skills just before the 2022 Asian Games.", "normalised": "A good athlete biography isn't just a chronological retelling of events.
