While many remember his dazzling stickwork during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, a biography might reveal the financial hardships he faced as a young sepoy in the British Indian Army, or the prejudice he encountered despite his undeniable talent. These accounts paint a richer picture of the athlete, grounding their accomplishments within the socio-political context of their time. We can learn about the immense pressure he shouldered representing a nation still under colonial rule and the emotional toll it took.", "normalised": "Similarly, biographies of hockey icons like Dhyan Chand offer invaluable historical perspectives.

Consider the detailed accounts of marathon runners like Fauja Singh, who completed marathons even after crossing 100 years of age, setting various age-group records at races like the Toronto Waterfront Marathon on 16/10/2011. These biographies, in their own way, become testaments to the enduring power of the human spirit. A good biography is not just a story; it's a legacy documented. R. Ashwin's story from a Chennai boy to a world-class spinner is another tale waiting to be penned.", "normalised": "Ultimately, athlete biographies are more than just accounts of sporting achievements.
