{"unnormalised": "The best athlete biographies go beyond just recounting achievements. They delve into the personal lives of these individuals, revealing their struggles, vulnerabilities, and the unwavering support systems that helped them navigate challenging times. We learn about the sacrifices made by their families, the guidance provided by their coaches, and the friendships forged in the crucible of competition. For instance, a biography chronicling Milkha Singh's journey, tracing his escape from the Partition of India in 1947 and his subsequent rise to become \"The Flying Sikh,\" offers a powerful lesson in resilience and the will to overcome unimaginable hardship. His near miss at the 1960 Rome Olympics, finishing fourth by a hair's breadth, is a poignant reminder that even in defeat, greatness can be found.", "normalised": "The best athlete biographies go beyond just recounting achievements.
