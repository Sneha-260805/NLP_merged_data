The book reveals the sacrifices he made, the pressures he faced, and the unwavering support he received from his family and mentors. Similarly, P.T. Usha's biography, if one existed with such depth, would undoubtedly showcase the hardships she overcame, training in modest facilities in Kerala to become the \"Queen of Indian Track and Field.\" Her near-miss Olympic medal in the 400m hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics is a story of grit etched in every Indian's memory.", "normalised": "Consider the biography of Sachin Tendulkar, “Playing It My Way.” It traces his journey from a young boy practicing tirelessly at Shivaji Park, Mumbai, under the watchful eye of coach Ramakant Achrekar, to becoming a global cricketing icon.

{"unnormalised": "Athlete biographies often delve into the cultural and societal contexts that shaped the athlete's journey. A biography of Milkha Singh, \"The Flying Sikh,\" vividly paints a picture of post-partition India, highlighting the challenges he faced as a refugee and his subsequent rise to become one of India’s greatest athletes. The book details his participation in the 1960 Rome Olympics, where he narrowly missed a bronze medal, a race he finished in a then-national record time. These narratives are often interwoven with personal anecdotes, providing a nuanced understanding of the athlete's character and motivations.", "normalised": "Athlete biographies often delve into the cultural and societal contexts that shaped the athlete's journey.

{"unnormalised": "The level of detail in these biographies is often impressive. They might include specifics like training schedules (e.g., waking up at 05:00 hrs for practice), dietary regimes, and tactical strategies employed during competitions. A hypothetical biography of Saina Nehwal could document her grueling badminton training sessions at the Pullela Gopichand Academy in Hyderabad, including the number of shuttlecocks she smashed daily (perhaps upwards of 500) and the kilometres she ran to build stamina. These granular details add authenticity and help readers appreciate the sheer hard work involved in achieving sporting success.", "normalised": "The level of detail in these biographies is often impressive.
