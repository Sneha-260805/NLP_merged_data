{"unnormalised": "These aren't simply celebratory accounts; the best athlete biographies delve into the complexities of their subjects. We learn about the rigorous training regimes, the mental fortitude required to overcome setbacks, and the impact of family, coaches, and rivals on their careers. Take, for instance, a hypothetical biography of P.V. Sindhu. It wouldn’t just chronicle her Olympic medals, but also the countless hours spent training at the Gopichand Badminton Academy, the challenges of balancing international competitions with personal life, and the unwavering support of her parents. We discover what motivated her to get up at 04:00 hrs every morning, push past injuries, and maintain that laser focus even when facing immense pressure on the world stage.", "normalised": "These aren't simply celebratory accounts; the best athlete biographies delve into the complexities of their subjects.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, athlete biographies often shed light on the socio-political context in which these athletes operate. Stories of overcoming societal barriers, fighting for equal opportunities, and using their platform to advocate for social change are frequently woven into the narrative.

They offer tangible examples of perseverance, discipline, and the importance of believing in oneself.

This can be incredibly inspiring and educational.", "normalised": "Beyond entertainment, these biographies serve as powerful motivational tools, especially for aspiring athletes.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, athlete biographies go beyond the scores, the medals, and the records. They provide a human dimension to sporting achievements, revealing the individuals behind the legends, their struggles, their triumphs, and their lasting impact on society.

They connect us to our sporting heroes on a deeper level, making their victories feel all the more meaningful and their journeys all the more relatable. They are, in essence, chronicles of extraordinary lives lived to the fullest.", "normalised": "Ultimately, athlete biographies go beyond the scores, the medals, and the records.
