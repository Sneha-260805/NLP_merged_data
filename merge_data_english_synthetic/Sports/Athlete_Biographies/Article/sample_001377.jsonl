{"unnormalised": "Beyond cricket, biographies of athletes from other disciplines are equally important. The story of Mary Kom, the Manipuri boxer, is a testament to sheer grit and determination. Her autobiography details her journey from a poverty-stricken village to becoming a multiple-time world champion. It speaks volumes about her commitment to her sport despite facing societal biases and financial hardships. Her training schedule, often starting at 05:00 hrs, and her rigorous diet are a source of inspiration.", "normalised": "Beyond cricket, biographies of athletes from other disciplines are equally important.

{"unnormalised": "Analyzing these narratives allows us to understand the role of coaches, family support, and institutional backing in shaping an athlete’s career. For example, P.V. Sindhu's journey, often documented through interviews and articles before a formal biography surfaces, highlights the importance of specialized training academies and government support for emerging badminton players. Her coach, Pullela Gopichand, played a crucial role in her development, pushing her to excel at the international level, culminating in her Olympic silver medal in Rio in 2016 and later a bronze in Tokyo in 2021.", "normalised": "Analyzing these narratives allows us to understand the role of coaches, family support, and institutional backing in shaping an athlete’s career.

They also offer valuable lessons in perseverance, sportsmanship, and the pursuit of excellence, qualities that are relevant far beyond the sporting arena.

The celebration of National Sports Day on 29th August, his birthday, is a testament to his enduring impact.", "normalised": "Furthermore, athlete biographies serve as valuable historical documents, preserving the legacy of sporting legends and providing future generations with role models.
