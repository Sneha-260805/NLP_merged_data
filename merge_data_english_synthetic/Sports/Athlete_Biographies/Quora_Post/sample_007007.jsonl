{"unnormalised": "Another notable recommendation would be the biography of Milkha Singh, \"The Race of My Life.\" This autobiography is incredibly moving, detailing his harrowing experiences during Partition and his subsequent dedication to running, culminating in his near Olympic medal. The Bollywood film based on his life, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,\" captured some of the essence, but the book provides a more nuanced and personal account of his journey, including rigorous training at the Madras Engineering Group (MEG) in Bangalore.

Sindhu, or perhaps even focusing on regional Indian sports heroes, can offer unique perspectives on the challenges and triumphs within specific sporting ecosystems. Consider biographies that delve into the socio-economic backgrounds of athletes and how they overcame adversity to achieve their goals.
