Growing up watching him smash sixes, it was fascinating to learn about his early struggles, how he balanced school in Mumbai with rigorous training, and his mental toughness under so much pressure from a nation of one billion rupees. Also, the story of him having biryani the night before a big match? Relatable!"}

I’m keen to add them to my reading list. Thinking of maybe tackling one about a kabaddi player next, or maybe someone from a rural background who made it big. What do you think?"}
