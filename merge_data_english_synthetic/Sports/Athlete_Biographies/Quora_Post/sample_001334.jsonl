India\" tugs at the heartstrings, but a well-written biography digs deeper, revealing the years of sacrifice and relentless training it takes to reach the pinnacle.

Knowing about her early mornings at the Pullela Gopichand Academy, traveling km just to train, contextualizes every smash and rally.", "normalised": "For me, reading about athletes is far more inspiring than watching a Bollywood flick about sporting glory.
