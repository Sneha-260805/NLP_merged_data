{"unnormalised": "One biography I highly recommend is \"Playing It My Way\" by Sachin Tendulkar. It's a deeply personal account of his journey from a young boy in Mumbai to becoming the ‘God of Cricket.’ He details the pressures of expectation from a billion+ Indians, his relationship with his family and coaches (like Dr. Ramakant Achrekar), and the highs and lows of his career spanning over two decades. It provides valuable insights into handling immense pressure and maintaining humility.", "normalised": "One biography I highly recommend is \"Playing It My Way\" by Sachin Tendulkar.

{"unnormalised": "Another compelling read is \"The Race of My Life\" by Milkha Singh. It’s a raw and emotional story about his resilience in overcoming the trauma of Partition and achieving sporting glory for India. His dedication and hard work are truly inspirational. Imagine running countless km every day, training in a cramped space of just 200 sq ft. His journey is a testament to the power of the human spirit.", "normalised": "Another compelling read is \"The Race of My Life\" by Milkha Singh.

It offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by women in sports, especially in a patriarchal society. Her sheer grit and determination to pursue her passion despite facing financial constraints and societal pressures are truly commendable. These books offer lessons far beyond the realm of sports and are worth every Rs. spent.", "normalised": "Finally, \"Unbreakable\" by Mary Kom is a powerful narrative of her struggles and triumphs as a female boxer from Manipur.
