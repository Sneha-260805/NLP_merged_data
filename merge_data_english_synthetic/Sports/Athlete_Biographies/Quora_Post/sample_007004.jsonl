It wasn't just about the medals he won at the Commonwealth Games or the nineteen sixty Rome Olympics (where he narrowly missed a medal in the four hundred meter). The book and the film explored his traumatic childhood during the Partition of India, his early struggles, and his relentless training regime in the Indian Army. It showed how he channeled his pain into becoming \"The Flying Sikh\"."}
