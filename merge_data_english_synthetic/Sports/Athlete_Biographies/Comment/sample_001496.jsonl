{"unnormalised": "Athlete biographies offer valuable insights. Dr. Sharma's book on Sachin Tendulkar is insightful. We learn about his early days in Mumbai and struggles before his success. Also, PT Usha's story inspires many. Imagine training on a 500 sq ft track! Hopefully, future biographies highlight more Indian athletes.
