{"unnormalised": "Athlete biographies offer valuable insights. Dr. Sharma's book on Sachin Tendulkar is a must-read. Stories of struggle from humble beginnings in Mumbai to international acclaim resonate deeply. Learning about PT Usha's rigorous training regime and Milkha Singh's dedication inspire. The detail on facility size (10,000 sq ft) and sponsorship value (Rs. 50 Lakhs) adds a realistic dimension. More biographies focusing on Kabaddi players are needed. A great addition to any sports library.", "normalised": "Athlete biographies offer valuable insights. Doctor Sharma's book on Sachin Tendulkar is a must-read.
