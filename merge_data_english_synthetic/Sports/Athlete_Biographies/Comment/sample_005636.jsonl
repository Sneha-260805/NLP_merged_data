{"unnormalised": "Athlete biographies are a great resource! Learning about Sachin Tendulkar's 24-year career or P.V. Sindhu's journey since 2009 is inspiring. Detailed accounts, like those covering the 1983 Cricket World Cup win or Dhyan Chand's hockey prowess, showcase dedication. I appreciate insights into training regimes and personal struggles, such as those faced by Mary Kom. More biographies on kabaddi players would be welcome! Perhaps focusing on Arjuna Award winners from institutions like NIS Patiala, maybe published by 14/11/2024? A biography on Milkha Singh at 11:00 hrs or PT Usha on 26/01/2025 would be fantastic.", "normalised": "Athlete biographies are a great resource!
