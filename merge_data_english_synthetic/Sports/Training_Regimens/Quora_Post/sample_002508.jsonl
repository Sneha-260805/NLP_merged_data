Start with short runs and slowly increase the distance over time. Include tempo runs (sustained effort at a comfortably hard pace) and hill repeats to build strength. Hydration is *especially* crucial in the Indian heat. Also, adequate rest between runs is extremely important, remember the 2nd of October Gandhi Jayanti is a very good day to just rest.", "normalised": "If you're into running, maybe like the athletes from Army Sports Institute, Pune, then it’s all about building mileage gradually.
