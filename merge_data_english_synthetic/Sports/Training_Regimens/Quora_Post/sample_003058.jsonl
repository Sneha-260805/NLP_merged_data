{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand your sport deeply. A kabaddi player in Patna requires a dramatically different regimen than a 100m sprinter training at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala. Strength training should be functional, not just aesthetic. Think building explosive power for jumps or throws, not just chasing bigger biceps like you might see in some Bollywood films.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand your sport deeply.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, periodization is crucial. This involves dividing your training into phases, like the off-season, pre-season, and in-season, each with specific goals. For example, the off-season might focus on building a strong base with long-distance running (e.g., 15 km runs) and strength work, while the pre-season sharpens speed and sport-specific skills.", "normalised": "Secondly, periodization is crucial.

Focus on local, seasonal fruits and vegetables. And don’t underestimate the power of sleep! Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Also, consider incorporating yoga and meditation techniques common in India for stress management and mental resilience.", "normalised": "Thirdly, nutrition and recovery are non-negotiable.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, listen to your body and adjust your training accordingly. Don't push through pain or ignore signs of overtraining. Working with a qualified coach and sports physiotherapist is highly recommended. Regular monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs), even simple ones like running times or resting heart rate, can help track progress and identify potential problems early. Remember, consistent effort and a well-planned regimen will ultimately yield results.", "normalised": "Finally, listen to your body and adjust your training accordingly.
