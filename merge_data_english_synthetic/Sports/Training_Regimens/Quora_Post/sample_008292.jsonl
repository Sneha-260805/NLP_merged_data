A diet rich in complex carbohydrates like dosa and idli, supplemented with protein from sources like dal, is often necessary. We must also be mindful of festivals like Onam where traditional meals, while delicious, may require careful balancing in a training diet. Maybe skip the third helping of biryani!", "normalised": "Secondly, **Nutritional Planning** must align with the athlete's caloric needs and cultural food preferences.

Whether it's increasing mileage for a marathon runner from Mumbai, aiming for 10km per day, or adding weight in the gym for a weightlifter, gradual increases in training intensity are vital. Tracking metrics like heart rate, perceived exertion (RPE), and performance data are all important. Always consult with certified coaches and medical professionals.", "normalised": "Finally, **Progressive Overload** is the cornerstone of any effective program.
