What works for a kabaddi player in Patna won't necessarily work for a badminton player training at the Pullela Gopichand Academy in Hyderabad. Identify your sport's demands – is it endurance, strength, speed, or a combination? Tailor your exercises accordingly.", "normalised": "Firstly, a proper regimen needs to be specific.

Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts.

Especially if you are training hard, in preparation for a game around a festive period like Onam, plan your nutrition accordingly! A top athlete like PV Sindhu wouldn't be winning medals with only idli and sambhar (no offense to south indian cuisine, haha!). Consider hydration protocols too, specially important with intense workouts in the summer months.", "normalised": "Finally, nutrition. What you put into your body directly impacts your performance.

Remember, consistent effort, even 30 mins daily, coupled with a smart regimen, will always triumph over sporadic bursts of intense activity.
