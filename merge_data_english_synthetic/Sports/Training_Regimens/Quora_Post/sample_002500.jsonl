Sleep, nutrition (a balanced diet with ample protein, maybe even a delicious biryani as a cheat meal post-competition!), and active recovery (light stretching, swimming) are integral parts of any effective training regimen. Incorporate yoga and meditation for mental fortitude, as it’s just as important as the physical aspect. Even during festival season like Onam, maintain a degree of discipline. Finally, consult with a qualified sports coach or trainer for personalized guidance tailored to your sport and ambitions. They can help you avoid overtraining and optimize your performance.", "normalised": "Don't neglect rest and recovery! Muscles grow and repair during rest.
