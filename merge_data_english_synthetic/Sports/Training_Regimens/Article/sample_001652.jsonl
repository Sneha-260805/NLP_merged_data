{"unnormalised": "What goes into a good training regimen? Well, first, consider the \"pillars of fitness\": strength, endurance, flexibility, and nutrition. A runner preparing for the Mumbai Marathon will need a lot of endurance training – think long runs, maybe 20-30 km on weekends, and interval training on weekdays. Someone aiming for powerlifting gold at the Commonwealth Games will focus on strength, hitting the gym hard with heavy weights. Flexibility is key for avoiding injuries, so incorporating yoga or stretching is vital, regardless of the sport. And nutrition? That’s the fuel for your engine. Forget your parathas every day, you need a balanced diet designed to support your training!", "normalised": "What goes into a good training regimen?

Good luck and Jai Hind!", "normalised": "Finally, remember that consistency is key.
