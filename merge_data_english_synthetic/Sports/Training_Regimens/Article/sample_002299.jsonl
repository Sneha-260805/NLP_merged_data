Maybe Mondays are strength training – squats, deadlifts, bench press – all that good stuff. Tuesdays could be cardio – a 10km run or some intense cycling. Wednesday? Rest, recover, maybe a gentle yoga session. Thursday mirrors Monday, Friday mirrors Tuesday, and Saturday could be a long endurance session like a 20km run or a challenging hike near Lonavala. Sunday? Absolutely mandatory rest! Remember the dialogue from \"Chak De! India\"? \"70 minute hain tumhare paas…\" Well, those 70 minutes were preceded by grueling training!", "normalised": "Now, let's talk structure.

Non-vegetarians have a wider array to choose from, but the principle remains the same: balanced nutrition to fuel your body and aid recovery. Don't forget hydration!
