Let us break it down a little. Strength training, whether it is lifting weights at a gym in Bandra or doing bodyweight exercises in your five hundred square feet apartment, builds the foundation. Conditioning improves your stamina and endurance. Picture Milkha Singh sprinting… that is peak conditioning!"}

So crucial, yet so often overlooked. Getting enough sleep (eight hours is the golden rule, folks!), proper nutrition (no cutting corners on your dal-roti!), and active recovery like yoga are all vital. Doctor Sharma at A I I M S always emphasized the importance of listening to your body. Do not push yourself if you are feeling pain, even if your coach is breathing down your neck."}
