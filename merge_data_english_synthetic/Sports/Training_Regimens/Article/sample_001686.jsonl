{"unnormalised": "So, what goes into a good training regimen? It's not just about lifting the heaviest weights, though that's definitely part of it for strength-based sports. It's about periodization, which basically means breaking your training year into different phases, each with a specific goal. You might start with a general fitness phase, building your base endurance with long runs – think 5 km jogs around Lodhi Garden. Then, you'd move into a strength phase, hitting the weights hard in the gym, focusing on compound exercises like squats and deadlifts.", "normalised": "So, what goes into a good training regimen?

Picture a kabaddi player perfecting their raid, needing that explosive burst of speed and agility. And finally, the competition phase, where you taper down the intensity and focus on sharpening your skills and mental toughness. This is where all that hard work comes together, allowing you to peak at the right time, like during the Ranji Trophy finals.", "normalised": "After that comes the power phase, where you work on explosive movements like plyometrics and Olympic lifts.

{"unnormalised": "It's also crucial to consider your recovery. Training breaks you down; recovery builds you back stronger. Think adequate sleep (at least 8 hrs), proper nutrition (dal makhani might be delicious, but maybe not pre-match!), and active recovery like yoga or swimming.

{"unnormalised": "Consulting with a qualified coach, a sports scientist, or even a Dr. specializing in sports medicine is invaluable. They can assess your strengths and weaknesses, design a personalized program, and monitor your progress. They can also help you avoid injuries, which are a major setback. Remember, consistency is key. Following a well-structured training regimen, even with its ups and downs, is much more effective than sporadic bursts of intense training. It’s an investment in yourself, both physically and mentally, and can easily cost you Rs. 5,000/month for personalized coaching. So, get your blueprint ready, put in the work, and chase your sporting dreams with the discipline and dedication worthy of a true champion!", "normalised": "Consulting with a qualified coach, a sports scientist, or even a Doctor specializing in sports medicine is invaluable.
