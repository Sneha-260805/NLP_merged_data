You wouldn't build a fancy haveli on a weak base, would you? The same applies to your body. Start with the basics – flexibility, core strength, and cardiovascular fitness. Stuff like yoga in the park, early morning jogs around Lodhi Garden, or even some simple bodyweight exercises at home. Remember that dialogue from Chak De! India - “seventy minute hain tumhare paas\"? Well, you need to dedicate those minutes religiously to your training."}

If you're a cricketer, that means hours in the nets, perfecting your cover drive (like Virat Kohli, hopefully!). For a badminton player, it’s shuttle runs and smashing practice. Let's say you're training for the Mumbai Marathon. That means gradually increasing your long runs, starting maybe with five kilometer and eventually hitting thirty plus kilometer before tapering down. Don't underestimate the importance of rest and recovery though! Your body needs time to rebuild and repair."}

Fuel your body with protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Think of a balanced thaali, with daal, roti, sabzi, and some curd. Hydration is also critical, especially in the Indian heat.

What works for Sachin Tendulkar might not work for you. Listen to your body, adjust your plan as needed, and don't be afraid to experiment. Gradual progression is key, avoid overtraining. Push yourself, but don’t push yourself too hard, too fast. Consistency is more important than intensity, especially in the beginning. Aim to improve by one percent each day, and those percentages add up quickly!"}
