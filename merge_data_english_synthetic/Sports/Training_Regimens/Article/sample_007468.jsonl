Whether you’re aiming for the local kabaddi tournament in Patna or dreaming of representing India in the Olympics, a solid training regimen is your best friend. It’s not just about sweating it out; it's about smart work, not just hard work. Think of it as your personal recipe for sporting success.", "normalised": "So, you want to up your game, eh?

{"unnormalised": "First off, before you jump into anything, a consultation with a good sports Dr. is key. They can assess your fitness levels, identify any potential injuries waiting to happen, and help you tailor a plan. Remember Ramesh from our gully, he went straight into heavy weightlifting and ended up with a slipped disc. Learn from his mistake!", "normalised": "First off, before you jump into anything, a consultation with a good sports Doctor is key.

{"unnormalised": "A proper regimen usually involves a balanced mix of cardio, strength training, and skill-specific drills. For cardio, maybe some early morning runs along Marine Drive in Mumbai, starting with 5 km and gradually increasing it. Or, if you're a swimmer, laps in the local pool at the YMCA. Strength training could involve hitting the gym for exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, or even using bodyweight exercises at home. The key is consistency.", "normalised": "A proper regimen usually involves a balanced mix of cardio, strength training, and skill-specific drills.

{"unnormalised": "Skill-specific drills are where you really hone your craft. If you’re a cricketer, that means hours in the nets, practicing your batting and bowling. A badminton player from PV Sindhu's academy might spend countless hours working on footwork and smash techniques in a 2000 sq ft court. Remember, practice makes perfect, but perfect practice makes permanent.", "normalised": "Skill-specific drills are where you really hone your craft.

{"unnormalised": "Nutrition is another crucial element. You can’t fuel a Ferrari with chai and samosas, can you? A balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats is essential. Think daliya, roti, sabzi, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Maybe even consult a dietician for a personalized plan. Many young athletes neglect this aspect and wonder why they plateau.", "normalised": "Nutrition is another crucial element. You can’t fuel a Ferrari with chai and samosas, can you?

{"unnormalised": "Don’t forget recovery! Your body needs time to rebuild and repair itself after strenuous training. This means getting enough sleep (at least 7-8 hours), incorporating rest days into your schedule, and perhaps even indulging in some relaxing yoga or meditation.
