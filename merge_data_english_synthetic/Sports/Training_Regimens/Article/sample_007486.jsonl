For a marathon runner training in Delhi's heat, the focus will be on long runs, maybe 30 km every other Sunday, supplemented with hydration strategies tailored to the Indian climate. A powerlifter from Punjab, on the other hand, might be hitting the gym 5 days a week, concentrating on squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, pushing for personal bests.

Say you want to improve your badminton skills at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy. Your plan could involve 3 days of on-court training, focusing on footwork and shots, 2 days of strength training (think lunges and core work), and one day of active recovery – maybe a light jog or yoga. The intensity should gradually increase over time, avoiding sudden spikes that could lead to injuries. Remember to factor in rest; your body needs time to repair and rebuild muscle.", "normalised": "Next, build a plan. Don't just wing it! Break your goals down into smaller, manageable steps.
