It's a comprehensive plan that incorporates various elements, like strength training, endurance work, skill development, and even recovery protocols.

He was practically crawling by the fifteen kilometer mark!"}

For example, the off-season might concentrate on building a strong foundation, while the pre-season focuses on sharpening skills and increasing intensity.

Rest days, proper nutrition (think home-cooked dal makhani and roti!), and even techniques like yoga and meditation can help athletes bounce back stronger.

You can't expect to improve if you're always doing the same thing. Gradually increasing the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts is essential for pushing your limits.
