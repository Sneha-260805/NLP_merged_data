{"unnormalised": "First up, strength and conditioning. This isn't just about looking good; it's about building the foundation you need to perform at your best. Think squats, deadlifts, and push-ups in the gym, designed to improve your power, speed, and endurance. A good trainer, maybe from the National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala, can help you design a plan tailored to your sport. For instance, a Kabaddi player from Tamil Nadu will need a very different regimen than a 100m sprinter from Kerala. Think explosive power vs. sustained speed.", "normalised": "First up, strength and conditioning.

{"unnormalised": "Next, skill practice. This is where you hone your technique. For a cricketer, it's hours in the nets, perfecting your cover drive or your yorker. For a badminton player, it’s endless drills to improve your net play and smashes. Repetition is key, and it's important to get feedback from a coach to correct any flaws in your technique. Remember that time Sachin Tendulkar supposedly spent hours practicing facing a single bowling machine setting? Dedication, bhai!", "normalised": "Next, skill practice.

So, find a plan that works for you, be disciplined, and don't give up on your dreams. Consider joining a good gym, maybe one with a 2000 sq ft space that offers specialized sports training, or consulting a Dr. specializing in sports medicine.
