Whether you're aiming for a marathon in Mumbai or just want to beat your personal best at badminton down at the local club, a solid training regimen is your secret weapon.

{"unnormalised": "First off, you need to figure out your goal. Are you building strength like Bajrang Punia, aiming for endurance like Milind Soman, or focusing on agility like PV Sindhu? Your goal dictates the types of exercises you’ll be doing. For example, if you're gearing up for the Delhi Half Marathon, lots of long-distance runs will be essential. Think 10km, 15km runs, gradually increasing the distance each week. Don’t forget speed work! Short, intense bursts of running (like 400m repeats) will improve your cardiovascular fitness.", "normalised": "First off, you need to figure out your goal.

Look at the athletes training at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala – they're not *just* running around a track all day. They're hitting the gym, lifting weights, and doing bodyweight exercises to build a strong foundation. Think squats, lunges, push-ups – the basics are your best friends. For a runner, strong legs and core mean better efficiency and reduced risk of injury.
