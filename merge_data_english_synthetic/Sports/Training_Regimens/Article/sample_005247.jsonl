{"unnormalised": "Next, break it down. A good training plan will incorporate different types of training: cardio, strength, flexibility, and skill-specific practice. Cardio could be anything from jogging in Cubbon Park to cycling near Marine Drive. Strength training might involve hitting the gym or doing bodyweight exercises at home. Flexibility is where yoga comes in – think Surya Namaskar in your rooftop 200 sq ft terrace! And skill-specific practice? That's all about honing your technique. Maybe some practice cricket sessions at your local academy.", "normalised": "Next, break it down.
