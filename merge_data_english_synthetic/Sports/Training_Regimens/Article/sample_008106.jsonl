Marathon training might involve long runs on Marine Drive building up from say, 5 km to 30 km gradually over weeks, interspersed with shorter, faster runs. Think tempo runs and interval training on the Juhu beach stretch to boost your speed. Don't forget strength training to protect your knees and prevent injuries. And proper nutrition is vital! We’re talking about fueling your body with the right carbs, proteins, and fats. A typical pre-race dinner might involve dal-chawal and plenty of fluids.", "normalised": "Let us say you are training for the Mumbai Marathon.

Think sprints, agility drills like cone drills around the local akhada (wrestling pit), and lots of plyometrics. Strengthening your core is crucial too. Pull-ups, push-ups, and core exercises will help you dominate on the mat. Don't neglect flexibility; it’s key to avoiding injuries when you're getting thrown around.
