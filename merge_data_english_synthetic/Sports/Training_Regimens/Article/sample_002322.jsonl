Whether you're aiming for state-level cricket like young Rohan from my gali or just trying to not huff and puff going up three flights of stairs, a solid training regimen is key. It's not just about hitting the gym and doing bicep curls until your arms scream \"Darrr!,\" although Darr the movie does have some intense chase scenes that probably counted as cardio for Sunny Deol."}
