It usually involves a mix of strength training, cardio, and sport-specific drills. Think of it like a well-balanced thali – you need everything to be satisfied and perform optimally. Strength training can be anything from lifting weights (bench press, squats, deadlifts – the classics!) to bodyweight exercises like push-ups and lunges. Find a good gym in your area, maybe \"Fitness First\" near your office in Bangalore. Aim for three to four sessions a week, focusing on different muscle groups each time. Remember, proper form is more important than lifting heavy; you do not want to end up sidelined with an injury like poor Rohan did trying to impress everyone."}
