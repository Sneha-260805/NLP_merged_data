{"unnormalised": "First off, forget those fancy, Instagram-worthy routines. Real training is about discipline, consistency, and listening to your body. Remember Kavita Devi, the wrestler? She didn't start with power cleans in a state-of-the-art gym.

Think dawn yoga sessions, surya namaskars to greet the sun, followed by a light but protein-rich breakfast – maybe a bowl of sprouted moong and some chai.

{"unnormalised": "The specifics vary, of course. A marathon runner like Milind Soman would focus on long, slow distance runs, gradually increasing mileage. We're talking 60-80 km weeks, broken up with tempo runs and interval training. A kabaddi player, on the other hand, needs explosive power and agility. Think agility drills, plyometrics, and countless hours spent raiding and tackling on the mat.", "normalised": "The specifics vary, of course.

{"unnormalised": "Strength training is crucial across the board. Whether it's lifting weights in a gym (many have expanded to 1500 sq ft areas), or doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges.
