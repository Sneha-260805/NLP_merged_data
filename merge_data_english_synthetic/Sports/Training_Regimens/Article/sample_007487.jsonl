It's not just about hitting the gym, it's about a structured plan that takes into account your strengths, weaknesses, and goals. First, you need to figure out your starting point. Get a baseline.

{"unnormalised": "A good regimen should also incorporate different types of training. Strength training is crucial, even for endurance sports. Think squats, lunges, deadlifts – all the good stuff.
