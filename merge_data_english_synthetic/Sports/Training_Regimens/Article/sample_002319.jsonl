{"unnormalised": "First things first, understanding where you're starting from is crucial. You wouldn't expect Shah Rukh Khan to jump straight into a perfectly choreographed dance sequence from \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" without rehearsal, right? Same principle applies here.

{"unnormalised": "Now comes the fun part: structuring your training regimen. This isn't just about mindlessly sweating it out at the gym. It's about planned progression. For example, if you're training for a marathon, start with shorter distances and gradually increase the mileage each week. A good rule of thumb is the 10% rule – don't increase your weekly mileage by more than 10%.", "normalised": "Now comes the fun part: structuring your training regimen.

Your muscles need time to repair and rebuild after intense workouts. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Incorporate rest days into your training schedule. Ignoring rest is like trying to drive a car on empty – you'll eventually run out of gas and maybe damage the engine.", "normalised": "And finally, rest and recovery!
