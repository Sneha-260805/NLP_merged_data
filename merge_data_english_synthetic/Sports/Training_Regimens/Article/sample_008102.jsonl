{"unnormalised": "Now for the fun part – designing your regimen. This is where you map out your workouts, taking into account the principles of progressive overload. Start easy and gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts. For example, if you're running, begin with 3 runs of 30 mins each, and slowly increase the time and distance each week. Maybe add in some hill sprints near Marine Drive for that extra challenge!", "normalised": "Now for the fun part – designing your regimen.

Consult with a qualified coach or physiotherapist if you have any concerns. They can help you tailor your regimen to your individual needs and prevent injuries.
