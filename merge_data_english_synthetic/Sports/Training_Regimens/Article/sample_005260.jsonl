{"unnormalised": "First things first, let’s talk fitness fundamentals. Before you even think about specialized training, you need a base level of strength and endurance. Think of it like building a strong foundation for a house – you can't build a fancy 3-story bungalow on a shaky base! So, cardio like running (maybe 5 km runs 3 times a week), swimming, or even cycling are crucial. Don't underestimate Surya Namaskar either; it's a fantastic all-rounder for flexibility and core strength. Many athletes in Bengaluru swear by it.", "normalised": "First things first, let's talk fitness fundamentals.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the strength training. You don't need a fancy gym with thousands of sq ft. Bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks are excellent. If you have access to weights, even better! Focus on compound movements like deadlifts, squats, and bench press. Remember proper form is more important than lifting heavy; consult a trainer, Dr. Sharma at the local YMCA is highly recommended, to ensure you're doing it right to avoid injuries.", "normalised": "Then comes the strength training.

A cricketer needs to focus on batting practice in the nets (bowling machine drills are great!), fielding drills, and building explosive power for running between the wickets. A badminton player will emphasize agility drills, footwork exercises, and smashing technique practice.", "normalised": "Now, let's get specific.
