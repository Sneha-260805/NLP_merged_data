{"unnormalised": "Let's talk specifics. A good regimen has a few key ingredients. Firstly, strength training. We're talking hitting the gym, lifting weights. Think squats, bench presses, deadlifts – the whole shebang. Get a good trainer, especially if you're new to it. Don't wanna pull a hamstring trying to impress everyone with your weightlifting prowess. Maybe start with 3 days a week, focusing on different muscle groups.
