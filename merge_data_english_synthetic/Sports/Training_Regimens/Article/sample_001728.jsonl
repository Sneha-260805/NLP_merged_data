Sindhu or trying to nail a perfect cover drive like Virat Kohli, a solid training regimen is your secret weapon. It's not just about hitting the ground running (literally!).

The National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala offers excellent coaching programs, and you can often find qualified trainers in your local area too. They might charge around Rs. 2000-5000 per month, but the investment is worth it. Remember, training smart is just as important as training hard.
