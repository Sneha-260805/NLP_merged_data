The kid’s got lightning feet and a killer dubki, and I heard whispers that Telugu Titans are offering him a whopping rupee one point five crore. That’s serious biryani money, folks!

At thirty two, he’s not quite a spring chicken anymore, but his experience and tactical nous are invaluable. Imagine him partnering with their existing defensive wall – opponents would need divine intervention, or maybe a good dose of Onam sadhya to fill them up so they can't run fast, to even score! The Bulls desperately need someone to tighten their defense after last season's semi-final heartbreak, so this could be a match made in kabaddi heaven."}

Teams are also scouting for promising young talent from all corners of India. Remember that district-level tournament in Haryana last month? Several scouts from P R O Kabaddi teams were spotted there, notebooks in hand, looking for the next Pardeep Narwal. Keep an eye out for some surprise signings – maybe a relative unknown from a small village who suddenly becomes a household name. That's the magic of the league, isn’t it?"}
