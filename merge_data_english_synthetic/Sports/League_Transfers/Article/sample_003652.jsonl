Like Diwali without mithai, a football season without transfer gossip would just be... incomplete, no? Every pundit, every chai stall discussion, is buzzing with who's going where, for how much, and whether they'll actually live up to the hype. It's almost as exciting as waiting for the first mangoes of the season."}

Word on the street is that several I-League teams are vying for his signature. Imagine, a boy from Jamshedpur potentially leading the attack for a big club like Mohun Bagan! That's the kind of story that makes you want to celebrate with a plate of biryani.

We're also seeing established players making moves. There's talk of veteran defender, Sandesh Jhingan, potentially returning to Kerala Blasters. He's a local hero there, and that would be a massive boost for the team, especially with Onam around the corner - the festivities would be wild! Last season, his presence was sorely missed."}
