{"unnormalised": "This transfer window, we've seen some serious action. Rumours are flying around like kites during Makar Sankranti. Take young Arjun Sharma, for example, tearing it up for Minerva Punjab. Word on the street is that Kerala Blasters are ready to shell out a hefty sum, maybe around Rs. 50 Lakhs, to bring him down south. He's got the speed, the agility, and the eye for goal – a real find, if you ask me. Imagine him linking up with Rahul KP upfront! That would be some serious firepower.", "normalised": "This transfer window, we've seen some serious action. Rumours are flying around like kites during Makar Sankranti.
