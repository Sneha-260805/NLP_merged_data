{"unnormalised": "This year, the buzz is all about young Rohan Sharma from Kolkata. Apparently, he's caught the eye of not just one, but three clubs! Word on the street is that Kerala Blasters are throwing serious money at him – we're talking in the ballpark of Rs. 2 crores per season! But East Bengal are reportedly ready to match that, fueled by the passionate support of their fans and maybe a little bit of insider information. And then there's the dark horse, Bengaluru FC, known for their meticulous planning and state-of-the-art training facilities. They might be offering a lower salary (around Rs. 1.75 crores) but promising Rohan a clear pathway to the first team. Tough choice, eh?
