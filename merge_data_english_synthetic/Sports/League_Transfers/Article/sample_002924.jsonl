Teams are looking to plug holes in their defense, boost their raiding power, and find that diamond in the rough – the player who will pull off a do-or-die raid that leaves the opposition stunned.

Except with more grappling and less hockey."}

After a relatively disappointing season, everyone is wondering if they will pull off a massive deal to bring in a seasoned defender.
