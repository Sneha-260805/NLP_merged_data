{"unnormalised": "Namaste folks! The kabaddi season is just around the corner, and you know what that means – the transfer window is officially OPEN! It's like Diwali shopping for coaches and team owners, only instead of mithai and diyas, they're eyeing raiders and defenders! This year's Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) auction promises to be a real dhamaka, with teams vying for the best talent.", "normalised": "Namaste folks!

{"unnormalised": "Rumours are flying around like kites during Makar Sankranti. Word on the street (or should I say, in the kabaddi padda) is that Patna Pirates are looking to rebuild after a slightly underwhelming season. Sources say they're eyeing a star raider from Haryana Steelers, possibly offering a hefty sum of Rs. 1.5 Crore! Meanwhile, Telugu Titans, who’ve been struggling to find consistency, are reportedly interested in an experienced defender from Puneri Paltan. He's got a record of 300+ tackle points – a real wall on the mat!", "normalised": "Rumours are flying around like kites during Makar Sankranti.

{"unnormalised": "But it's not just about the big names. Teams are also scouting young talent from local tournaments across India. Remember that guy, Arjun, from the junior nationals in Jaipur last year? He's got incredible agility and a knack for escaping ankle holds. Apparently, U Mumba is keen on signing him up, seeing him as a potential future star. It's all about finding that diamond in the rough, isn't it?", "normalised": "But it's not just about the big names. Teams are also scouting young talent from local tournaments across India.

{"unnormalised": "The impact of these transfers can be huge. One star player can completely transform a team's dynamics. Think about it – a strong raider can consistently score points, relieving pressure on the defense. A rock-solid defense can shut down the opposition's attack, giving their own raiders more confidence. It's like the perfect recipe for success, just like your mom's biryani!", "normalised": "The impact of these transfers can be huge. One star player can completely transform a team's dynamics.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the big names and the astronomical sums of money (Rs. can run into crores!), there’s a real human story here. These athletes are essentially moving their careers, their lives, to new cities, new teams, new coaches. It’s a lot of pressure, especially for younger players leaving home for the first time. They're moving from the comfort of their familiar surroundings, maybe a small village with a 500 sq ft home, to the big city, expected to perform under immense pressure.", "normalised": "Beyond the big names and the astronomical sums of money (rupees can run into crores!), there’s a real human story here.

{"unnormalised": "The auction dynamics are fascinating too. Teams strategize, negotiate, and sometimes even engage in bidding wars. It's like a game of chess, but with real people and millions of rupees at stake! Dr. Sharma, the former coach of Bengaluru Bulls, once told me that he spends months analyzing player stats and team dynamics before even considering a bid. It's not just about skill; it's about finding the right fit, the right mentality.", "normalised": "The auction dynamics are fascinating too.
