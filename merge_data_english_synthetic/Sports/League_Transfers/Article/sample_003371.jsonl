Well, whispers are he's being scouted by Minerva Punjab, and apparently, they're willing to shell out a hefty sum, rumored to be around rupee fifty lakhs. That's quite a jump for a player still practically a bachcha! But then again, talent is talent, and Rohan’s got it in spades. Imagine the headlines if he makes the cut!"}
