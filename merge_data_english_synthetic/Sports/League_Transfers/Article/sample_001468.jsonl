{"unnormalised": "First up, young Arjun \"Messi\" Murthy’s move from the Chennai City FC to East Bengal. This lad, only 20 yrs old, is touted to be the next Sunil Chhetri. East Bengal shelled out a reported Rs. 1.5 Crore for him! That's a lot of biryani, my friends. The Kolkata crowd is already chanting his name, hoping he’ll bring back the glory days.

He apparently had a verbal agreement with Gokulam Kerala FC, even went to Kozhikode and checked out a potential flat, around 1200 sq ft. But then, bam! He signs with Churchill Brothers at the last minute. Whispers of a bigger signing bonus are doing the rounds. Seems like Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, smiled more favourably on Goa this time.", "normalised": "Then there is the controversy surrounding veteran defender, Rajesh Sharma.

He’s a box-to-box player with the stamina of a marathon runner. Dr. Roy, the Dempo coach, seems pretty confident about his team’s chances this season. He even quipped in a press conference that they are ready to \"give the big boys a run for their money,\" quite the filmy dialogue.", "normalised": "Speaking of Goa, Dempo S C has been quietly building a formidable squad.

This is a huge step for her, a chance to showcase her skills on a bigger stage.
