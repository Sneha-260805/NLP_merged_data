It's that time of year again, folks, when the air is thick with speculation, rumours swirl faster than a Mumbai monsoon, and kabaddi teams are busy reshuffling their squads like a deck of cards at a Diwali gathering.

{"unnormalised": "This year, the chatter is all about which team will snag Rahul Chaudhari. Remember \"Showman\" Rahul? He's a veteran raider, a legend, and even though he's not quite at his peak, he can still bring a lot of experience and crowd appeal. Will he end up back with the Telugu Titans, his original home? Or will a team like UP Yoddha, looking to bolster their raiding department, swoop in and offer a hefty sum?

I hear whispers that they have their eye on a young prospect from Haryana, a certain Sonu Kumar, who's been tearing it up in the local tournaments. His ankle hold is supposedly legendary.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the big names, there's always the intriguing drama of players moving to smaller teams, hoping for more playing time. This is where you see some real underdog stories unfold. Imagine a player like Ramesh, who spent years on the bench for Bengaluru Bulls, finally getting a chance to shine with a team like Gujarat Giants.
