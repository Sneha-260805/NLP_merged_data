Rohan Sharma, previously with the Mumbai Strikers, has signed a three-year deal with the Bengaluru Bulls for a reported rupee fifty lakh. Quite the jump for the lad, considering his roots in a small village near Patna. Everyone’s saying the Bulls needed a solid midfielder after losing their star player, Vijay Singh, to a European club.

Apparently, the Delhi Dynamos are eyeing a young defender from the Tata Football Academy in Jamshedpur. His name’s Arjun Verma, and he’s supposed to be a real talent.
