Young Arjun Singh, a promising midfielder from Punjab, made a shocking move to a Kerala-based club for a reported Rs. 30 Lakh transfer fee and a two-year contract. Apparently, the Kerala club offered him a special clause guaranteeing him regular playing time, plus, and this is key, *lots* of biryani. Everyone knows a way to an athlete's heart is through their stomach! Speaking of Kerala, there were rumours of teams vying for the services of international defender, Lee Min-ho (no relation to the actor, sadly!), but the deal reportedly fell through due to visa issues and inflated salary demands – apparently, he wanted the equivalent of 5000 USD a week.", "normalised": "We saw some serious action this transfer window.
