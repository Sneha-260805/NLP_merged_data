{"unnormalised": "League transfers, whether in football (soccer), cricket, or even kabaddi, are driven by a complex interplay of factors. Performance is paramount; consistently strong performances significantly increase a player's market value and attract attention from bigger clubs. Think of someone like Sunil Chhetri – his goal-scoring prowess over the years has undeniably made him a valuable asset.", "normalised": "League transfers, whether in football (soccer), cricket, or even kabaddi, are driven by a complex interplay of factors.

{"unnormalised": "Financial considerations are also huge. Clubs with deeper pockets can afford to offer higher wages and transfer fees. We see this globally, but it’s also becoming more prevalent in leagues like the ISL (Indian Super League). Agent representation also plays a critical role, negotiating deals and advocating for their clients' best interests.", "normalised": "Financial considerations are also huge.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, club strategy and team needs heavily influence transfers. A team lacking a solid defender might prioritize acquiring one, regardless of other considerations. Contract situations (expiration dates, release clauses) also dictate the feasibility of a transfer. For example, a player entering the final year of their contract can often be acquired for a lower fee.", "normalised": "Furthermore, club strategy and team needs heavily influence transfers.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, cultural factors shouldn’t be ignored. A player might prefer to play in a city or country with a large diaspora, or where the food is good (perhaps someone misses home-cooked biryani!). Transfers can truly make or break a team’s season, so strategic management is key. We saw the impact when Kerala Blasters made some key acquisitions just before Onam last year! These moves can really stir up local fanbases.", "normalised": "Finally, cultural factors shouldn't be ignored.
