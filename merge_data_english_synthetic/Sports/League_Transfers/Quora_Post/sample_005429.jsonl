{"unnormalised": "Firstly, on-field performance is paramount. A striker consistently scoring goals, like a young Sunil Chhetri clone, or a defender capable of shutting down opponents, naturally attracts attention and transfer offers. Clubs are constantly scouring for talent to bolster their squads, often after rigorous scouting and performance data analysis using advanced metrics.", "normalised": "Firstly, on-field performance is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, financial considerations play a huge role. The transfer fee itself, often negotiated intensely between clubs, can be substantial. Player salaries are also crucial. Can a club afford the player's wage demands, especially given the ISL's salary cap rules? Think of a Kerala Blasters fan dreaming of affording a Brazilian superstar, but budget constraints are always a reality.", "normalised": "Secondly, financial considerations play a huge role.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, the player's contract situation is critical. A player nearing the end of their contract has more leverage and might be available at a reduced transfer fee. Similarly, a player seeking more playing time might push for a transfer, even if it means a lower salary. Imagine a talented Bengal-born midfielder stuck on the bench, itching for a move to a club like East Bengal where he'd get more opportunities.", "normalised": "Thirdly, the player's contract situation is critical.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, sometimes transfers are driven by personal reasons. A player might want to move closer to family or experience a different culture. The transfer window is a period of high drama, strategic planning, and ultimately, a quest for sporting success. These factors often come to play especially during the time just before or after festivals like Onam, as players and staff travel around. Transfer fees are often quoted in Rs. and salaries can be very varied. Clubs could spend up to 5 Cr. Rs. on a single player, with weekly salaries of around 50,000 Rs. or more.", "normalised": "Finally, sometimes transfers are driven by personal reasons.
