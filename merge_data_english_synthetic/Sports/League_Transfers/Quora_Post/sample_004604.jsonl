What factors influence these transfers, and what are the implications for clubs and players?", "normalised": "Firstly, finances play a crucial role. Clubs like Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, with their rich history and passionate fan base, are often willing to spend significant rupees on acquiring talent. Player market value, performance statistics (goals scored, assists, etcetera), and remaining contract length all heavily influence transfer fees.
