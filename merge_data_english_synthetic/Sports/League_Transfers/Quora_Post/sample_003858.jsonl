{"unnormalised": "League transfers are complex events driven by a multitude of factors. On the global stage, player performance is paramount. A consistently high performer, especially in crucial roles like striker or central midfielder, will naturally attract attention from wealthier clubs. Club finances also play a significant role – a club struggling financially may be forced to sell star players, even against their sporting wishes. Agent influence can't be ignored; Mino Raiola, for example, wielded considerable power in negotiating deals.", "normalised": "League transfers are complex events driven by a multitude of factors.

{"unnormalised": "Coming to Indian football, we're witnessing an evolving landscape. The ISL has brought increased exposure and investment, leading to more transfers. However, factors like player availability (due to visa restrictions and quotas on foreign players), club infrastructure (training facilities and stadiums) and even something like cultural fit influence decisions. A player from Kerala, used to the Onam festivities and the aroma of freshly cooked biryani, might find it harder to adapt to a club in, say, Kashmir, than a more cosmopolitan player.", "normalised": "Coming to Indian football, we're witnessing an evolving landscape.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the relative strength of academies like the Tata Football Academy dictates the flow of young Indian talent. We're also seeing a greater emphasis on scouting local talent in tier-2 and tier-3 leagues, which wasn't the case 5-10 years ago. The transfer fees in ISL are still comparatively low compared to European leagues (typically ranging from a few Lakhs to a few Crore Rupees), but the overall trend is upward, indicating a growing professionalization of Indian football. The hope is that this leads to a stronger national team and more competitive leagues. Ultimately, transfers influence team dynamics, league competitiveness, and the overall development of the sport in India.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the relative strength of academies like the Tata Football Academy dictates the flow of young Indian talent.
