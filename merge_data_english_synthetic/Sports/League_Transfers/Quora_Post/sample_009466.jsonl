{"unnormalised": "What factors influence league transfers in sports, particularly in the context of Indian leagues like the I-League or Pro Kabaddi League?", "normalised": "League transfers are a complex interplay of several factors. Obviously, performance is paramount. A player consistently topping the scoring charts or boasting an impressive tackle rate is naturally sought after. Think of someone like Sunil Chhetri's impact on Indian football. Secondly, financial considerations play a crucial role. Teams with deeper pockets, perhaps backed by wealthy owners from Mumbai or Chennai, can offer more attractive salaries and signing bonuses, measured in lakhs of rupees, to lure talent."}

A promising young player might prefer to join a smaller club in search of regular playing time rather than warm the bench at a giant like Mohun Bagan. Agents, like those representing players from the Tata Football Academy, play a significant role in negotiating deals and advising players. Infrastructure, like the availability of world-class training facilities covering thousands of square feet, and robust medical support from qualified personnel like Doctor Sharma, can also sway a player's decision. Contract duration (for example, a three-year deal) is always a critical point of negotiation. Finally, the club's vision for the future, and their ambitions to win titles, can be a persuasive factor for many players."}
