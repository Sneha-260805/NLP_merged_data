Team needs, tactical fit (does the player complement the coach's philosophy, like a perfect Hyderabadi biryani?), financial constraints, and even off-field chemistry play significant roles.

Teams are looking beyond just the glamour and paying closer attention to metrics like pass accuracy, distance covered (in km), and defensive contributions.
