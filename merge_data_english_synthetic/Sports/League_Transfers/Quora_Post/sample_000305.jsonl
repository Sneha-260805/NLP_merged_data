But what exactly are league transfers, and why are they so crucial?", "normalised": "Simply put, league transfers are the formal process by which a player moves from one club to another, typically involving a transfer fee paid by the acquiring club to the selling club. This fee compensates the selling club for the loss of the player and often reflects the player's perceived market value, age, contract length, and performance record. For instance, the potential transfer of a promising young Indian striker from Mohammedan Sporting Club to a club like Bengaluru F C would involve intricate negotiations and a significant transfer sum, perhaps running into several lakhs of Rupees, depending on his goal-scoring record."}

A star signing can electrify a fanbase and significantly raise expectations. However, a poorly judged transfer can destabilize a team's harmony.
