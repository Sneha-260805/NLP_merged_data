{"unnormalised": "League transfers are complex deals influenced by several factors. Performance, naturally, is key. A striker consistently netting goals – think someone like Sunil Chhetri in his prime – significantly increases their transfer value. Contract length is also crucial. A player with only a year left on their contract is likely to be sold for less than one with three years remaining.", "normalised": "League transfers are complex deals influenced by several factors.

{"unnormalised": "Are Indian clubs becoming more active? Absolutely. They're investing heavily in scouting and infrastructure. Dr. Kumar, a well-known sports analyst, estimates that ISL clubs spent upwards of Rs. 50 Cr. on transfers in the last season alone. This activity signifies a growing ambition to compete at a higher level, both domestically and potentially internationally. The development of local talent, however, needs continued focus alongside these big-name signings.", "normalised": "Are Indian clubs becoming more active? Absolutely.
