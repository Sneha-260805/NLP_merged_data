Can he handle the pressure of playing in front of a demanding Eden Gardens crowd? Second, financial considerations are paramount. Can the club afford the player’s transfer fee and wages without jeopardizing its financial stability? We've seen many clubs, like the now-defunct Royal Wahingdoh FC, struggle after overspending.

A promising young player scouted from a local academy in Kerala might command a transfer fee of Rs. 50 Lakhs and require accommodation of at least 800 sq ft, but if they deliver on their potential, it could prove to be a bargain.
