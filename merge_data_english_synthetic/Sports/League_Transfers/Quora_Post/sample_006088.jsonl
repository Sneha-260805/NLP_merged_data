{"unnormalised": "Player transfers in football, globally and in leagues like the ISL, are a complex interplay of several factors. Performance, of course, is paramount. A striker banging in goals, like Sunil Chhetri in his prime, will invariably attract attention. Beyond individual brilliance, tactical fit within a team's formation is crucial. Think of a coach like Stimac needing a specific type of midfielder to execute his game plan for the Indian national team.", "normalised": "Player transfers in football, globally and in leagues like the I S L, are a complex interplay of several factors.

{"unnormalised": "In the ISL, you'll find these dynamics are often amplified by the relatively shorter league season and the strong desire of clubs to quickly build competitive squads. The transfer window is a frenzy, akin to the rush before Onam celebrations, with teams scrambling to secure key players. Rumours often fly around concerning players transferring from I-League to ISL too. Think of a promising young defender making the jump after a stellar season with a Kolkata club, hoping to get a taste of that ISL fame and – let's be honest – that sweet, sweet biryani money.
