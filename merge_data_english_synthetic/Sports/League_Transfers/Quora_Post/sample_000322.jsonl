A team struggling with their midfield in I-League, for example, might target a skilled playmaker from another club or even a foreign player scouted specifically for that role.

Clubs like Mohun Bagan A C, with richer owners, often have a significant advantage in attracting top talent, potentially outbidding smaller clubs. The valuation of players is subjective, with scouting reports, past performance, and potential all contributing to the asking price. Sometimes, it’s a gamble; a player who shines in one league might not perform in another. Remember Jeetu Rai, a promising young athlete, struggling after transferring to a new academy?"}
