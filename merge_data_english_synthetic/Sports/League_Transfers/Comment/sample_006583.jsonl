{"unnormalised": "Interesting to see the recent transfers. Will Chennaiyin FC's acquisition of Rahim Ali bolster their attack? Reminds me of Chak De! India, needing that perfect team. Hope ISL clubs are doing due diligence; hefty transfer fees (Rs. 50 Lakhs+) need justification. Player fitness, kilometers covered, and tactical fit should be thoroughly analyzed. All eyes on Jamshedpur FC now. Good luck to the players in their new ventures. Exciting times for Indian football.", "normalised": "Interesting to see the recent transfers.
