{"unnormalised": "Interesting transfers this season. Will Chennaiyin FC’s new midfield, including Anirudh Thapa, finally give them the much-needed josh, like in \"Chak De! India\"? East Bengal's defensive acquisitions are also crucial. Can they stop ATK Mohun Bagan's attack, especially with their reported Rs. 5 Crore investment in that striker? Keeping an eye on ISL's development; grassroots programs across UP need this boost. Hope the new players adapt swiftly to the Indian climate & playing style. 100 km sprints in training should help. Let's see what happens on the pitch. Fingers crossed for a competitive season.", "normalised": "interesting transfers this season will chennaiyin F C's new midfield including anirudh thapa finally give them the much needed josh like in chak D E india east bengal's defensive acquisitions are also crucial can they stop A T K mohun bagan's attack especially with their reported rupee five crore investment in that striker keeping an eye on I S L's development grassroots programs across U P need this boost hope the new players adapt swiftly to the indian climate and playing style one hundred kilometer sprints in training should help let's see what happens on the pitch fingers crossed for a competitive season"}
