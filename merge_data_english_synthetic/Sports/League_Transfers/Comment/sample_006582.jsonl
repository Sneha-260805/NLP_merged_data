{"unnormalised": "Interesting transfers this season. I hope the Mohun Bagan acquisition of young Rohan Sharma pays off. He’s got potential, reminds me of a young Bhaichung Bhutia. Rs. 2 Crores seems like a fair price in this market.  Let’s see if he can live up to the hype, kind of like *Chak De! India* but on the field. Hoping for good performances, especially against East Bengal!  The 50 km move to Kolkata should benefit him. Good luck, Rohan!", "normalised": "Interesting transfers this season.
