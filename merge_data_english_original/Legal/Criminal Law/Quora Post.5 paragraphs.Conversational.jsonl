{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about criminal law in India, right? It's a pretty vast topic, but let's break it down a bit. Criminal law basically deals with actions that are considered offences against society as a whole, not just against an individual. Think things like theft, assault, murder, etc. The main law here is the Indian Penal Code, or IPC, which was enacted way back in 1860. It's been amended a bunch of times since then, obviously.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about criminal law in India, right? It's a pretty vast topic, but let's break it down a bit.

{"unnormalised": "Now, the IPC has sections for pretty much everything. Sec. 302 deals with murder, Sec. 376 covers rape, Sec. 420 is for cheating (like, financial fraud), and so on. Plus, there are other specific laws like the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Arms Act, and a whole bunch more depending on the type of crime. If you commit any of these crimes, you'll likely land yourself in court facing charges filed by the police under these sections.", "normalised": "Now, the I-P-C has sections for pretty much everything.

{"unnormalised": "The process usually starts with someone filing a FIR (First Information Report) at the local police station. The police then investigate, collect evidence, and if they think there's a case, they file a chargesheet in court. The court then conducts a trial where both sides present their arguments and evidence. It can take months, sometimes even years, for a case to be decided. There are layers of courts, from magistrate courts all the way up to the Supreme Court if the case is appealed.", "normalised": "The process usually starts with someone filing a F-I-R (First Information Report) at the local police station.

It all depends on the specific crime and the judge's discretion based on the facts of the case.
