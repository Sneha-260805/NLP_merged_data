{"unnormalised": "The Indian Penal Code (IPC) outlines various offences and their corresponding punishments. Two sections often discussed in the context of homicide are Section 302 and Section 304. Understanding the nuances between these sections is crucial in legal proceedings to ensure appropriate justice.

{"unnormalised": "Section 302 of the IPC is invoked when a person commits murder, defined as causing death with the intention to kill, or with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. A classic example would be premeditated murder, where the accused planned and executed the act with a clear intention to end the victim's life. Cases such as State of Maharashtra vs. Arun Gulab Gawli, Cr. Appeal No. 123 of 2010, often grapple with establishing this intent beyond reasonable doubt. The punishment for murder under Sec. 302 is either death or life imprisonment, along with a fine.", "normalised": "Section three hundred and two of the I-P-C is invoked when a person commits murder, defined as causing death with the intention to kill, or with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

{"unnormalised": "Section 304, on the other hand, applies to cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. This means the act caused death, but without the specific intention or knowledge required to classify it as murder under Sec 302. Section 304 is further divided into two parts. Part I applies when the act is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, but the circumstances do not amount to murder. Part II applies when the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. For example, rash and negligent driving leading to a fatal accident could fall under Sec. 304A. The punishment under Sec. 304 Part I can extend to life imprisonment, or imprisonment for up to 10 years, along with a fine. Sec 304 Part II carries a punishment of imprisonment up to 10 yrs, or fine, or both.", "normalised": "Section three hundred and four, on the other hand, applies to cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

{"unnormalised": "The critical difference, therefore, hinges on the presence or absence of intention. If the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted with the intent to cause death, or with the knowledge that their actions would almost certainly result in death, Sec. 302 is applicable. If the intention is absent, but the act was committed with knowledge or recklessness, Sec. 304 comes into play. The burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish the elements of either section.", "normalised": "The critical difference, therefore, hinges on the presence or absence of intention.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the distinction between IPC 302 and 304 is a matter of judicial interpretation based on the specific facts and circumstances presented in each case. The courts carefully analyze the evidence, including witness testimonies, forensic reports, and the accused's state of mind, to determine the appropriate section under which to prosecute. Cases often hinge on the subtle differences in evidence and the interpretation of intent, making these distinctions crucial for a fair and just legal outcome. A good lawyer can argue the applicability of the section.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the distinction between I-P-C three hundred and two and three hundred and four is a matter of judicial interpretation based on the specific facts and circumstances presented in each case.
