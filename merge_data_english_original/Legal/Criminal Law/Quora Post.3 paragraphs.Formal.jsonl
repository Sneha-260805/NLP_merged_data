{"unnormalised": "Sections 302 and 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) are critical in defining culpable homicide, but they differ significantly in their implications. Sec. 302 deals with murder, prescribing the punishment for whoever commits murder shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. A crucial element for invoking Sec 302 is proving intent to cause death or knowledge that the act is likely to cause death, as seen in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Ashok Sharma. The severity of the punishment reflects the gravity of the offence, as murder involves a higher degree of culpability and malice.", "normalised": "Sections three hundred and two and three hundred and four of the Indian Penal Code (I-P-C) are critical in defining culpable homicide, but they differ significantly in their implications.

{"unnormalised": "In contrast, Section 304 addresses culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It is bifurcated into two parts: Part I deals with acts done with the intention of causing death or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, prescribing a punishment of imprisonment for life, or imprisonment up to 10 yrs, along with a fine. Part II covers acts done with the knowledge that they are likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death or cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, prescribing imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both. For example, consider a situation where someone hits another person on the head with an object, knowing it could cause death, but without the direct intent to kill; this might fall under Sec. 304 Part II.", "normalised": "In contrast, Section three hundred and four addresses culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

{"unnormalised": "The key distinction lies in the mental state of the offender. Sec 302 requires a deliberate intention to cause death or the knowledge that the act is almost certain to result in death, whereas Sec. 304 involves a lesser degree of intention or knowledge. Legal practitioners like Adv. Rajesh Kumar often argue for Sec. 304 rather than Sec. 302 to mitigate the severity of the sentence. Court rulings, such as in Cr. Appeal No. 456 of 2021, emphasize the need for precise determination of the offender’s mental state to apply the appropriate section of the IPC.", "normalised": "The key distinction lies in the mental state of the offender.
