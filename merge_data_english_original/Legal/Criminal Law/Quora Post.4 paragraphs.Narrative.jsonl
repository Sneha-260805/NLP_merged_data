{"unnormalised": "Basically, a criminal offense is an act or omission that is prohibited by law and punishable by the state. Think things like theft, assault, murder, fraud - anything under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). But it's more nuanced than just breaking a rule. There has to be *mens rea* - criminal intent - in many cases. Rakesh’s case, for instance, involved a boundary wall being built a few inches over the neighbor's property line. Initially, the neighbor filed a police complaint under IPC 420 (cheating), but Adv. Sharma argued successfully that there was no intent to cheat, it was just a surveying error.", "normalised": "Basically, a criminal offense is an act or omission that is prohibited by law and punishable by the state.

{"unnormalised": "There's also the concept of *actus reus* - the actual guilty act. Both intent and the act itself usually need to be present for it to be considered a crime. So, thinking about committing a crime isn't usually punishable unless you actually *do* something towards it. Attempted murder, for example, is still a crime, even if the victim survives. Punishment can range from a small fine (like Rs. 500) to imprisonment for life, or even the death penalty in the rarest of rare cases, as determined by the court.", "normalised": "There is also the concept of *actus reus*, the actual guilty act.
