{"unnormalised": "Saw a news snippet about Adv. Mehra arguing a Section 304A case in the Delhi High Court yesterday. Apparently, the accused was driving under influence (DUI) at 11:30 PM on 16/05/2024 near India Gate and hit a pedestrian. The victim, unfortunately, passed away. The argument was whether it qualifies as culpable homicide or just rash driving causing death. Tough call, honestly. Remember a similar case back in '08, where my uncle, Mr. Sharma, got involved. The IPC sections are a maze!", "normalised": "Saw a news snippet about Advocate Mehra arguing a Section three hundred four A case in the Delhi High Court yesterday.
