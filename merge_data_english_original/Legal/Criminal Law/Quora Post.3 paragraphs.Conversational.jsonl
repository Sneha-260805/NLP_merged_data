Think of things like theft, murder, or even something like sedition. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the main law, and it defines all sorts of crimes and their punishments. You'll often hear about sections like IPC 302 (for murder) or IPC 379 (for theft) in the news. Advocates and Judges refer to these sections all the time.", "normalised": "Okay, so you're asking about criminal law in India, right?

Then the police investigate and collect evidence. After that, the case goes to court, where the prosecution (representing the state) tries to prove that the accused committed the crime.
