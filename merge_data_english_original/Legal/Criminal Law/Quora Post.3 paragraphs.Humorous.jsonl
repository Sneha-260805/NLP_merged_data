{"unnormalised": "Okay, technically speaking, theft *is* theft, and IPC Section 379 does talk about punishment for stealing movable property.

Realistically, unless you’re stealing a whole cartload of samosas (then maybe IPC Section 380 – theft in a dwelling house – becomes relevant...kidding!), you're safe. Just buy the darn samosa next time, okay? Save yourself the legal drama and support your local street vendor.
