{"unnormalised": "Under Indian Criminal Law, offenses are broadly classified into cognizable and non-cognizable. This distinction primarily affects the procedure of investigation and arrest. A cognizable offense, as defined under CrPC Section 2(c), is one for which a police officer can arrest a person without a warrant. These offenses are typically more serious in nature, such as murder (IPC 302), rape (IPC 376), kidnapping, and dacoity.", "normalised": "Under Indian Criminal Law, offenses are broadly classified into cognizable and non-cognizable.

{"unnormalised": "Conversely, a non-cognizable offense is one where a police officer cannot arrest without a warrant issued by a Magistrate. These offenses are generally less severe, for example, simple hurt (IPC 323), defamation (IPC 499), or cheating involving a relatively small amount. CrPC Section 2(l) defines what constitutes a non-cognizable offence.", "normalised": "Conversely, a non-cognizable offense is one where a police officer cannot arrest without a warrant issued by a Magistrate.

C-R-P-C Section two sub l defines what constitutes a non-cognizable offence."}
{"unnormalised": "The fundamental difference lies in the initiation of the investigation. In cognizable cases, the police can register an FIR (First Information Report) and begin an investigation suo moto, without the need for a Magistrate’s order. In non-cognizable cases, the police must obtain permission from a Magistrate before commencing the investigation, as per CrPC Section 155. The procedure is more protracted, offering greater protection against unwarranted police action in less serious matters.", "normalised": "The fundamental difference lies in the initiation of the investigation. In cognizable cases, the police can register an F-I-R (First Information Report) and begin an investigation suo moto, without the need for a Magistrate’s order. In non-cognizable cases, the police must obtain permission from a Magistrate before commencing the investigation, as per C-R-P-C Section one hundred and fifty five. The procedure is more protracted, offering greater protection against unwarranted police action in less serious matters."}
{"unnormalised": "In summary, cognizable offenses empower the police to act swiftly to prevent further harm, while non-cognizable offenses require judicial oversight to protect individual liberties. Understanding this difference is crucial for both law enforcement and citizens to navigate the legal system effectively and ensure due process under CrPC.", "normalised": "In summary, cognizable offenses empower the police to act swiftly to prevent further harm, while non-cognizable offenses require judicial oversight to protect individual liberties.
