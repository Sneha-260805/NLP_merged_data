{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm a bit confused about the new tax laws. My CA, Mr. Sharma, explained some stuff, but honestly, it went right over my head. He mentioned something about Sec 80C deductions, and I think he said I could claim up to Rs. 1.5 lakh in total deductions, but I'm not entirely sure what all qualifies.
