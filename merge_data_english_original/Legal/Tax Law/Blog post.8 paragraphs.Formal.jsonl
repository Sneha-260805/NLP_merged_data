{"unnormalised": "The Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020, enacted by the Indian Parliament, represents a pivotal effort to alleviate the burden of protracted tax litigation and augment revenue collection. This Act seeks to furnish taxpayers with a mechanism for settling direct tax disputes pending before various appellate forums, including the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), High Courts, and the Supreme Court of India. Its genesis lies in the acknowledgement that prolonged legal battles not only tie up substantial governmental resources but also inflict financial and operational distress upon businesses. The Act, therefore, offers a pathway for taxpayers to resolve disputes amicably, fostering a more conducive environment for economic growth and stability.", "normalised": "The Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Act, two thousand and twenty, enacted by the Indian Parliament, represents a pivotal effort to alleviate the burden of protracted tax litigation and augment revenue collection.

{"unnormalised": "The core principle underpinning the Vivad se Vishwas Act is the provision of a waiver of interest, penalty, and prosecution in exchange for the taxpayer paying the disputed tax amount. In cases where the dispute pertains solely to interest or penalty, the taxpayer is required to pay only 25% of the disputed amount. This framework presents a significant incentive for taxpayers to opt for settlement, particularly those facing substantial interest and penalty burdens. The Act, as such, is not a blanket amnesty scheme; rather, it is a structured mechanism designed to address the specific issue of pending tax disputes. Sec 148A of the Income Tax Act remains unaffected.", "normalised": "The core principle underpinning the Vivad se Vishwas Act is the provision of a waiver of interest, penalty, and prosecution in exchange for the taxpayer paying the disputed tax amount.
