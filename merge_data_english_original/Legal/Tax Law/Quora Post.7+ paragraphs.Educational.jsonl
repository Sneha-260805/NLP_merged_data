It lays down the rules for taxing income earned in India. This includes salary, business profits, capital gains (like selling property or shares), and income from other sources. For example, if you sell a flat you inherited in Mumbai for rupee eighty lakh and it was valued at rupee fifty lakh when you inherited it, the rupee thirty lakh difference is a capital gain that will be taxed (subject to certain deductions and exemptions). Keep in mind Section fifty four provides an exemption under some conditions like investing in another house."}
