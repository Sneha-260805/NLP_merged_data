Is it not enough that our waistlines are already taxed by these delightful treats? The govt. clearly wants a share of our happiness. The GST on that chai might also be around 5%.", "normalised": "First off, let’s address the elephant in the room, or rather, the G-S-T on the samosa.

Every year, millions of us scramble to gather Form 16s, receipts, and assorted documentation that looks suspiciously like ancient scrolls. It's a national sport, akin to cricket, only with more anxiety and less cheering. And let's not forget the joy of deciphering the various sections and sub-sections. Section 80C? Section 54? It’s like learning a whole new language, one that only tax professionals and insomniacs truly understand. I swear, I spent 3 hrs last year figuring out what to do.", "normalised": "Then there’s the whole I-T return filing process.

{"unnormalised": "And just when you think you've got it all figured out, the government decides to \"simplify\" the tax code. \"Simplify,\" of course, means \"make it even more complicated, but pretend it's easier.\" This usually involves introducing new forms, new rules, and new ways to accidentally end up owing the IT dept. a small fortune. Remember when they said \"taxation will be so simple, a child can do it\"? I think even my 10 yr old nephew would struggle!", "normalised": "And just when you think you've got it all figured out, the government decides to \"simplify\" the tax code. \"Simplify,\" of course, means \"make it even more complicated, but pretend it's easier.\" This usually involves introducing new forms, new rules, and new ways to accidentally end up owing the I-T department a small fortune.

It's complicated, it's confusing, and it can sometimes feel like you're being robbed blind. But hey, at least it provides endless fodder for jokes, right? Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go figure out if I can claim a deduction for the therapy I need after dealing with all this.
