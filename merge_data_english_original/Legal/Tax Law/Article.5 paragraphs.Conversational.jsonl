{"unnormalised": "Now, you'll often hear about different GST rates: 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. Which rate applies depends on what you're buying or selling. Essential items usually have lower rates, while luxury goods get taxed higher. So, that fancy imported watch will probably attract a 28% GST, while your daily bread might fall under the 5% slab. Businesses with a turnover of more than Rs. 40 lakh (₹40,00,000) generally need to register for GST. Smaller businesses can opt for a composition scheme, which is simpler but has its own set of rules.", "normalised": "Now, you'll often hear about different G-S-T rates: five percent, twelve percent, eighteen percent, and twenty eight percent.

{"unnormalised": "One key thing to remember is Input Tax Credit (ITC). Simply put, if you're a business, you can get credit for the GST you've already paid on your purchases. This reduces your overall tax liability. For example, if Rahul’s garments purchased raw material worth Rs. 10,000, and he paid Rs. 1200 as GST. Now, when Rahul sells the final product he collects GST, say Rs. 2000. Then he can claim ITC of Rs. 1200 and only needs to deposit Rs. 800. Keep all your invoices organized to claim ITC accurately.", "normalised": "One key thing to remember is Input Tax Credit (I-T-C).
