While a simplified tax structure was the initial aim, several rate slabs exist, ranging from 0% to 28%, alongside special rates for items like gold (3%) and certain services. Furthermore, the concept of \"reverse charge mechanism\" (RCM) necessitates the recipient of certain goods or services to pay GST directly to the government, adding another layer of complexity. For instance, businesses availing legal services from Adv.

Discrepancies in these areas can lead to ITC denial, resulting in increased tax liability. Section 16 of the CGST Act outlines the detailed conditions for availing ITC, making its interpretation crucial for tax planning. For example, if M/s. Gupta & Sons fails to file their GSTR-1 by the 11th of the following month, their buyers may face issues claiming ITC.", "normalised": "The Input Tax Credit (I-T-C) mechanism, designed to prevent the cascading effect of taxes, is another area prone to complications.
