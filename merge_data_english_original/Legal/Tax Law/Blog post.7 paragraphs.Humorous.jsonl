{"unnormalised": "Navigating Indian tax law can feel like trying to find your way through a Delhi traffic jam at 5 PM – chaotic, frustrating, and you're pretty sure you're going to get hit by an auto-rickshaw. The IT Dept. (Income Tax Department, for the uninitiated) seems to speak a language only understood by chartered accountants and ancient Sanskrit scholars. You file your ITR (Income Tax Return) with the hope that you've done everything right, but a tiny part of you is convinced you'll get a notice that says you owe Rs. 27 because of a clerical error you made in 2017.", "normalised": "Navigating Indian tax law can feel like trying to find your way through a Delhi traffic jam at five P M – chaotic, frustrating, and you are pretty sure you are going to get hit by an auto-rickshaw.

{"unnormalised": "Let's face it, the sheer volume of rules and regulations is enough to make even the most seasoned taxpayer break out in a cold sweat. Section 80C? More like Section 80Confusion! You’re trying to maximize your deductions, juggling investments like ELSS, PPF, and insurance policies. It's like playing a financial Jenga – one wrong move and your tax planning strategy comes crashing down. And don't even get me started on GST (Goods and Services Tax). Trying to figure out the correct rate for that samosa you just bought? Good luck with that!", "normalised": "Let us face it, the sheer volume of rules and regulations is enough to make even the most seasoned taxpayer break out in a cold sweat. Section eighty C?

It feels like you're trying to decipher a secret code. Maybe the taxman is actually a spy in disguise? Or perhaps he just enjoys making our lives unnecessarily complicated.

It's always the same: you tell yourself you'll start early, but then life happens – weddings, Bollywood movies, chai breaks – and suddenly it's 31st July, and you're hunched over your laptop at 11:59 PM, praying the server doesn't crash.

Maybe one day, filing taxes will be as easy as ordering a pizza online.
