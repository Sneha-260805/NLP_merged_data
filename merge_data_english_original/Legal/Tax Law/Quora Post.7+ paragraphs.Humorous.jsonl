{"unnormalised": "First off, tax law in India is this giant, confusing beast. It's like that auntie who knows everything about everyone and judges you silently. You've got your Income Tax Act, GST, maybe even some weird property tax stuff if you own land bigger than your neighbour's ego. Understanding it requires either a law degree or a serious caffeine addiction (I recommend the latter).", "normalised": "First off, tax law in India is this giant, confusing beast.

But really, it mostly involves desperately searching for deductions before March 31st so you don't end up paying half your salary to the govt. Things like investing in ELSS funds or paying for your parents' medical insurance… stuff you should probably be doing anyway, but suddenly feels super urgent when the deadline looms.

{"unnormalised": "The real kicker is dealing with TDS (Tax Deducted at Source). Basically, the government assumes you're a tax-dodging villain and makes everyone deduct tax before they even pay you.
