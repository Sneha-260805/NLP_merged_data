{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about Intellectual Property Law in India, so thought I'd share what I know. Basically, IP law protects your creations - things like trademarks, patents, copyrights. Think of it like this: if you come up with a cool new logo for your chai stall, you can register a trademark so no one else uses it. Same goes for inventions; if you invent a new type of auto-rickshaw engine, you can get a patent to protect it for 20 years.", "normalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about Intellectual Property Law in India, so thought I'd share what I know.

{"unnormalised": "Now, why bother with all this legal stuff? Well, it gives you exclusive rights. No one can copy your design or sell your invention without your permission. If they do, you can sue them in court! It's all about protecting your hard work and investments. Say, for example, you've written a killer Bollywood script. You get automatic copyright protection for 60 years after your death! Don't let anyone steal your ideas, yaar!", "normalised": "Now, why bother with all this legal stuff?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are exceptions and limitations. \"Fair use\" allows for limited use of copyrighted material for things like education, criticism, or parody. Patents have to be genuinely new and inventive - you can't just patent something that's already obvious. Trademarks have to be distinctive and non-generic. Registration is key, though, so make sure to file those applications with the IP office in Delhi. Fees vary, but they're generally around Rs. 5000 to Rs. 10000 per trademark.", "normalised": "Of course, there are exceptions and limitations. \"Fair use\" allows for limited use of copyrighted material for things like education, criticism, or parody.
