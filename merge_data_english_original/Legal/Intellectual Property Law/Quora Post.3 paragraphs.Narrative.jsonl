{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me if registering a trademark is really worth the hassle in India. Let me tell you a story. My cousin, Riya, started a small online business selling handcrafted sarees. She named it \"Silken Threads\" and even designed a beautiful logo. For the first year, sales were decent, but she didn't think much about legal stuff like trademarks. She was more focused on getting those Bangalore silk sarees shipped on time!", "normalised": "Someone asked me if registering a trademark is really worth the hassle in India. Let me tell you a story.

She contacted a lawyer, Adv. Sharma, who informed her that without a registered trademark, she had very little legal recourse. Turns out, some other company had already filed for \"Silken Threads\" trademark in class 25 (clothing) before Riya did.", "normalised": "Then, suddenly, she noticed another website using the same name and almost identical logo.

{"unnormalised": "The whole legal battle cost Riya around Rs. 50,000 in legal fees and lost sales while Adv. Sharma tried to work out a deal. She eventually had to rebrand her business to \"Riya's Silks\" and create a completely new logo, starting all over again. So, yes, registering your trademark, even for a small business, is absolutely worth it in India. It can save you a lot of heartache and money down the line. Think of it as an insurance policy for your brand! Filing online can be done pretty quickly now, usually in around 6-12 months, but the peace of mind is priceless.", "normalised": "The whole legal battle cost Riya around rupee fifty thousand in legal fees and lost sales while Advocate Sharma tried to work out a deal.
