{"unnormalised": "Interesting thread! Just wanted to add that under Indian Intellectual Property Law, registering your trademark is crucial. Even if your business is small, like a chai stall named \"Chai Central\" in Mumbai, getting it registered under the Trademarks Act, 1999 protects it from being copied. Also, remember copyright protects original artistic works like Bollywood movie scripts or song lyrics. Section 13 of the Copyright Act covers many aspects. For patent protection, innovations at IIT Bombay or any other Indian institute need to be novel, non-obvious, and have industrial application as per Patents Act, 1970. Cases like Bajaj Auto Ltd. vs. TVS Motor Company show how seriously IP infringement is taken in Indian courts. Always consult Adv. Sharma or any IP lawyer for proper guidance before launching your startup to avoid legal hassles.", "normalised": "interesting thread! just wanted to add that under indian intellectual property law, registering your trademark is crucial. even if your business is small, like a chai stall named \"chai central\" in mumbai, getting it registered under the trademarks act, one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine protects it from being copied. also, remember copyright protects original artistic works like bollywood movie scripts or song lyrics. section thirteen of the copyright act covers many aspects. for patent protection, innovations at I-I-T bombay or any other indian institute need to be novel, non-obvious, and have industrial application as per patents act, one thousand nine hundred and seventy. cases like bajaj auto limited versus T-V-S motor company show how seriously I-P infringement is taken in indian courts. always consult A-D-V sharma or any I-P lawyer for proper guidance before launching your startup to avoid legal hassles."}
