{"unnormalised": "Why is this important? Well, IP protection prevents others from unfairly profiting off your work. It gives you exclusive rights for a certain period (e.g., 20 years for patents) so you can commercialize your invention or brand. For instance, if you’ve developed a new drug formula, a patent prevents other companies from manufacturing and selling it without your permission. IP rights can be licensed or sold, creating valuable revenue streams. Remember to consult Adv. Sharma or another lawyer specializing in IP if you have a specific invention you want to protect!", "normalised": "Why is this important?
