Think of it like this: if you write a song, design a logo, or invent a new gadget, IP law gives you rights over it. It’s like saying, “Hey, this is mine, hands off!” The main types you'll hear about are trademarks (like the Nike swoosh), copyrights (protecting books and music), and patents (for inventions).
