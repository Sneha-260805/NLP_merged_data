{"unnormalised": "First things first, what's a corporation? In simple terms, it's a separate legal entity from its owners. Think of Tata, Reliance, Infosys – these are all big names governed by this law. They operate under the Companies Act, 2013. Yeah, a big, scary number, I know! This Act basically lays down the groundwork for how these companies are formed, managed, and even shut down if things go south.", "normalised": "First things first, what's a corporation?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the heart of any company: its board of directors. These folks are like the captains of the ship, making all the major decisions. But here's the catch: they have a fiduciary duty, which means they need to act in the best interests of the company, not just their own pockets. So, no funny business like insider trading, okay? The Companies Act specifies qualifications; for example, at least 1 director needs to have stayed in India for 182 days in the previous calendar year.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the heart of any company: its board of directors.

{"unnormalised": "Shareholders, you ask? They're the owners of the company, holding shares like pieces of a pie. They get a say in big decisions through voting rights. They also have the right to information, which means companies can't hide shady deals from them. Annual General Meetings or AGMs, happen every year, normally before 30/09, giving shareholders a chance to question management, approve financial statements, and generally make sure the ship is sailing smoothly.", "normalised": "Shareholders, you ask?

{"unnormalised": "What about mergers and acquisitions (M&A)? This is where things get really interesting! Imagine one company gobbling up another or two companies joining forces to become a superpower. M&A is all about growth, expansion, and sometimes, survival. These deals need to be approved by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to make sure no one is creating a monopoly. For example, if one company wants to buy more than 25% of another listed company, it must make an open offer to buy shares from other shareholders as well.", "normalised": "What about mergers and acquisitions (M-and-A)?

{"unnormalised": "Now, compliance is key. Companies need to file all sorts of documents with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) on time, like annual returns and financial statements. Missing deadlines can result in hefty penalties. For instance, failing to file the annual return can lead to a penalty of Rs. 100 per day until the default is rectified. The MCA has portals where companies can file these documents online.", "normalised": "Now, compliance is key.
