{"unnormalised": "First things first, starting a company. The Companies Act, 2013 is your go-to document here. It lays down all the rules for incorporation, which is basically the process of registering your company with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). You'll need to decide what kind of company you want – a Private Limited company (like most startups) or a Public Limited company (think biggies like Reliance Industries). Each has its own set of rules and responsibilities. Registration can be done online now, mostly through the MCA portal.

{"unnormalised": "What about mergers and acquisitions (M&A)? Corporate law plays a HUGE role here. Imagine Tata Steel wanting to buy another company, like Bhushan Steel, back in the day.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is the key legislation here. It aims to help creditors recover their money while giving the company a chance to restructure or, if that's not possible, liquidate its assets fairly.
