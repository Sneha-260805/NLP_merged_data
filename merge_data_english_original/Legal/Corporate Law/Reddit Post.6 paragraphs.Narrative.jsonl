{"unnormalised": "So, I'm running a small startup, \"Desi Grub,\" we deliver authentic Indian meals cooked by home chefs. It's been doing pretty well, touchwood, but I'm feeling a bit lost in the legal maze surrounding incorporation and all that. Currently, it's a sole proprietorship, and I’m planning on converting it to a Private Limited Company under Companies Act, 2013.

{"unnormalised": "The advocate I spoke to, Adv. Verma, suggested a Pvt. Ltd. structure for limited liability, which sounds good, frankly. He mentioned something about RoC filings every year and complying with several sections, like Sec. 8 and 134. But honestly, I was mostly nodding along, absorbing maybe 50% of what he said.
