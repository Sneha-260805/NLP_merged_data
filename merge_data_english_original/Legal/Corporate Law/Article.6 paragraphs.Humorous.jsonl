{"unnormalised": "Ah, Corporate Law! The very words conjure images of mahogany-lined boardrooms, suited figures pontificating about shareholder value, and enough paperwork to fell an entire forest. But beneath the veneer of seriousness lies a world of quirky regulations and loopholes big enough to drive a Tata Nano through (remember those?). Trying to navigate it can feel like trying to find a parking spot in Chandni Chowk during Diwali – utterly chaotic, and probably requiring divine intervention.", "normalised": "Ah, Corporate Law!

You'd think choosing someone to check your books would be straightforward. Nay! Prepare for a dance of resolutions, eligibility criteria that read like a Kafka novel, and the ever-present specter of \"independent directors\" who may or may not understand the difference between profit and loss.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are the mergers and acquisitions, or M&As, as the cool kids call them. Think of it as corporate matchmaking, except instead of romance, it's all about synergy and cost-cutting. You've got valuations to haggle over, due diligence to conduct (unearthing skeletons in the closet is practically a national sport at this point), and regulatory approvals that take longer than it takes to get a passport renewed. One wrong move, and you're stuck with a corporate equivalent of a bad arranged marriage. God save you if you happen to violate Section 230 of the Companies Act.", "normalised": "Then there are the mergers and acquisitions, or M-and-A-s, as the cool kids call them.

SEBI is like that strict auntie at a wedding, making sure everyone behaves and no one sneaks extra gulab jamuns. Insider trading? Oh ho, Auntie SEBI is watching!
