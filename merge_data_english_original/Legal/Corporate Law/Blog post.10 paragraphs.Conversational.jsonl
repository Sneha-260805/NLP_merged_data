{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you'll encounter is the Companies Act, 2013. It's like the Bible for corporate governance here. It covers everything from incorporation (starting a company) to winding up (closing it down). A key part is understanding the difference between Pvt. Ltd. companies and Public Ltd. companies. Pvt. Ltd. cos. are closely held, usually by a few families or investors, while Public Ltd. cos. can raise money from the public through IPOs. You'll also see a lot about MoA (Memorandum of Association) and AoA (Articles of Association) – these are basically the company's charter and internal rules.", "normalised": "One of the first things you'll encounter is the Companies Act, two thousand and thirteen.

The Act lays down rules on their responsibilities, duties, and liabilities.
