{"unnormalised": "My journey into the legal world began with a surprisingly mundane task: helping my uncle, Rajesh Sharma, incorporate his small textile business. Uncle Rajesh, or Rajesh bhaiyya as we call him, had been running a successful weaving unit in Surat for over 2 decades, a true testament to his resilience. But the increasing competition, coupled with his ambition to expand beyond Gujarat, pushed him to seek formal incorporation.

{"unnormalised": "I envisioned myself diving headfirst into complex litigation, arguing passionately in courtrooms, like in Bollywood movies. Instead, I found myself wading through the Companies Act, 2013, a document thicker than my medical textbooks back in school. The initial shock was real.

{"unnormalised": "The first hurdle was choosing the right type of company. Should it be a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)? I spent hours researching the pros and cons, poring over articles and seeking advice from senior colleagues at the law firm where I interned. The decision hinged on factors like capital requirements, liability concerns, and future expansion plans. Eventually, we settled on a Private Limited Company, primarily because Rajesh bhaiyya wanted to maintain greater control and the option to raise capital more easily down the line.", "normalised": "The first hurdle was choosing the right type of company.

{"unnormalised": "Next came the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA), the foundational documents of the company. Crafting these required careful consideration of the company's objectives, powers, and internal regulations. Drafting the MOA's object clause, detailing what \"Sharma Textiles Pvt. Ltd.\" would do, felt oddly philosophical. It wasn't just about weaving fabric; it was about contributing to the Indian textile industry, providing livelihoods, and building a legacy.", "normalised": "Next came the Memorandum of Association (M-O-A) and Articles of Association (A-O-A), the foundational documents of the company.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the dreaded DIN, or Director Identification Number. Applying for it involved navigating the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) portal, a digital maze filled with forms, uploads, and verifications. I felt like I was deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. The website kept throwing up errors, and the timelines felt excruciatingly slow. My respect for the Company Secretaries who handled these things day in and day out grew exponentially.", "normalised": "Then came the dreaded D-I-N, or Director Identification Number.

{"unnormalised": " Securing the company name was another challenge. I remember suggesting \"SharmaFabrics,\" but the MCA registry rejected it because a similar name already existed.

The entire process taught me patience, perseverance, and the importance of double-checking every detail.", "normalised": "Securing the company name was another challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Filing Form INC-32, the SPICe+ form for incorporation, was a test of my organizational skills. Gathering all the necessary documents – identity proofs, address proofs, PAN cards, digital signatures – felt like assembling a complex jigsaw puzzle. One missing document could derail the entire process. The advocate handling the digital signature part of it, Mr. Patel charged Rs. 2000 for it.", "normalised": "Filing Form I-N-C-three two, the S-P-I-C-e plus form for incorporation, was a test of my organizational skills.

{"unnormalised": "The most stressful part was waiting for the Certificate of Incorporation. Every day, I would refresh the MCA portal, hoping to see the magical document appear.

{"unnormalised": "The learning curve was steep, but the experience was invaluable. I realised that corporate law wasn't just about legal jargon and compliance; it was about helping businesses like my uncle’s take shape and contribute to the Indian economy.

I even helped Rajesh Bhaiyya apply for a GST number using his PAN card No ABCDE1234F, feeling slightly more confident and less bewildered this time around. And who knows, maybe someday I’ll be arguing a landmark corporate law case in the Supreme Court.
