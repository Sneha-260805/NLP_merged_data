Now, before you start picturing mahogany desks and pinstripe suits, let me tell you, it's often less \"Suits\" and more \"sweatpants\" these days, especially after 2020!

{"unnormalised": "First things first, what *is* Corporate Law? It's the rulebook for businesses. Think of it as the \"ghar ka niyam\" (house rules) for companies, but on a much larger, legally binding scale.

Knowing the rules helps you build castles, not sandcastles that the first wave of litigation washes away.
