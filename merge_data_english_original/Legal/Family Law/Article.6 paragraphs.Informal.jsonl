{"unnormalised": "Family law in India can seem like a total jalebi – sweet, but oh-so-complicated. Whether you're dealing with a divorce, inheritance, or child custody, understanding the basics is crucial. Trust me, you don't want to get lost in the legalese without a map. This isn’t legal advice, mind you, but more like a friendly heads-up.", "normalised": "Family law in India can seem like a total jalebi – sweet, but oh-so-complicated.

{"unnormalised": "First things first, marriage. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the rules are different, alright? Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains generally fall under the 1955 Act. Muslims have their own set of rules, influenced by Sharia. And then there's the Special Marriage Act, 1954, for inter-faith marriages. It's a bit of a khichdi, isn't it?", "normalised": "First things first, marriage.

{"unnormalised": "Divorce is another tricky area. For Hindus, common grounds include adultery, cruelty, desertion, and conversion. Under Muslim law, divorce can be initiated by either the husband (talaq) or the wife (khula). Also, recent Supreme Court judgements have shaken things up a bit, clarifying rights and interpretations. It's a good idea to check case laws like Shayara Bano vs. Union of India for the latest updates.", "normalised": "Divorce is another tricky area.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody disputes are often the most emotionally charged. The court's primary concern is always the child's welfare. Factors like the parent's financial stability, emotional well-being, and ability to provide a stable environment are considered. Grandparents often have a role too, and visitation rights become a big question. Advocate Sharma at the Delhi High Court specialises in these cases.", "normalised": "Child custody disputes are often the most emotionally charged.

{"unnormalised": "So, if you're facing any family law issues, do your homework. Read up on relevant Acts, like the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. And if things get too complicated, consult a lawyer. It might cost you Rs. 5000 or more for a consultation, but it could save you a lot of heartache (and money) in the long run.
