{"unnormalised": "First things first, what are your rights? This is HUGE! Whether you're a woman or a man, the law is there to protect you. Things like maintenance (alimony, as some call it), child custody, and division of property are all super important. Don't just assume things will work out; get proper legal advice. I’ve seen cases where people lose out on lakhs of rupees simply because they weren’t aware of their entitlements.", "normalised": "First things first, what are your rights? This is huge!

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of property, *who gets what?* Now, this is where it gets tricky, esp. if you and your spouse have a lot of assets. Is it jointly owned? Did you buy it before or after the marriage? Did you contribute to its purchase or upkeep? These are all questions the court will consider. In some cases, even gifts received during the marriage can be considered marital property.", "normalised": "Speaking of property, who gets what?

{"unnormalised": "Child custody is another massive issue. Courts usually prioritize the child's best interests. Who's the primary caregiver?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's maintenance. This is basically financial support one spouse gives to the other after the divorce. It could be a lump sum payment or monthly payments. Factors considered include the earning capacity of both spouses, their standard of living during the marriage, and the length of the marriage.

{"unnormalised": "Another big thing is documentation. Keep everything! Marriage certificate, property documents, bank statements, medical records... everything.

{"unnormalised": "Consider mediation or counselling. Before jumping into a full-blown legal battle, explore alternative dispute resolution methods.
