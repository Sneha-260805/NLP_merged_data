{"unnormalised": "Firstly, ditch the drama. Seriously. While shouting “Main tumhare bacche ki maa banne wali hoon!” might work in a movie, it’s unlikely to impress the judge at the Thane Family Court. You need solid grounds for divorce, and believe me, “irreconcilable differences” is just the tip of the iceberg. Think more along the lines of desertion for 2 years, or maybe cruelty (emotional or physical). FYI, saying your spouse's cooking tastes like your chappal is *not* grounds for cruelty! (Learnt that the hard way).", "normalised": "Firstly, ditch the drama. Seriously.

Under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, alimony can be a lump sum or periodic payments. The amount depends on a million things: your spouse’s income, your contributions to the household (emotional labor counts, ladies!), and even your lifestyle.
