{"unnormalised": "So, family law in India, right? It's a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. We're talking about things like marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. But here’s the thing – it's not one-size-fits-all. Different religions have their own set of rules. For instance, Hindu marriages are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, while Muslims have their personal laws. You'll often see cases referencing sections like Sec 125 CrPC for maintenance.", "normalised": "So, family law in India, right? It's a bit of a mixed bag, honestly.

{"unnormalised": "Divorce can be messy, as anyone who's been through it will tell you. Mutual consent divorces are usually quicker. But contested divorces? Expect a long haul involving lawyers and court visits. Things like alimony (maintenance after divorce) are also decided based on various factors, like income and assets. Advocate Sharma mentioned a recent case where the wife got ₹50,000/month. Child custody is always a priority, thankfully.", "normalised": "Divorce can be messy, as anyone who's been through it will tell you. Mutual consent divorces are usually quicker.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's inheritance. Under Hindu law, daughters have equal rights to ancestral property now, which is a huge win! But laws around wills and succession can get complicated, especially when land is involved. My neighbour, Mr. Verma, is still fighting a case related to his grandfather's property, registered back in 1947! He says the lawyer's fees alone have crossed Rs. 2 lakh.", "normalised": "Then there's inheritance. Under Hindu law, daughters have equal rights to ancestral property now, which is a huge win!

{"unnormalised": "Adoption is another area. The Juvenile Justice Act governs adoption procedures, aiming to ensure the child's welfare. CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) plays a big role. While adopting a child might seem daunting, there are success stories of people giving loving homes to children in need.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, family law in India is a complex field constantly evolving. If you're dealing with any of these issues, it's always best to consult a good lawyer.

They mean well, but laws are laws!", "normalised": "Overall, family law in India is a complex field constantly evolving.
