{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, what legal recourse does Priya have if Rohan proceeds with the relocation without her consent or a court order? Could she file an injunction or any other legal action to prevent the relocation? Considering that the child has been residing in Bangalore for a significant period, is there a possibility that Indian courts would retain jurisdiction over the custody matter, even if the child is physically present in the US? Could the principles established in landmark cases like *Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal* be applicable? Any insights into this complicated area would be greatly appreciated. Rohan's employment contract states he has to be in NYC by 01/01/2025, so time is of the essence here.", "normalised": "Furthermore, what legal recourse does Priya have if Rohan proceeds with the relocation without her consent or a court order?
