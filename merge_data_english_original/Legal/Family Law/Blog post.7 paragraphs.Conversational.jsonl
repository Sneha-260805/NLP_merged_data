{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole issue of alimony. How much will the wife get? How much can the husband realistically pay? This is where things get sticky. Some courts order a lump sum – say, ₹20,00,000 – while others go for monthly payments, maybe Rs. 25,000/- per month. It all depends on factors like the husband's income, the wife's earning potential (or lack thereof), and the length of the marriage. BTW, the courts usually consider 1/3rd of the husband’s net income as a reasonable benchmark for alimony.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole issue of alimony. How much will the wife get?
