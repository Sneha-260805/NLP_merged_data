{"unnormalised": "First off, the lingo. I swear, they speak a different language in those hallowed halls. My lawyer, Adv. Sharma (bless her patient soul), kept tossing around terms like \"alimony,\" \"custody,\" and \"Section 125 CrPC.\" I felt like I needed a decoder ring just to understand what was going on. Turns out \"alimony\" isn't some fancy Italian dessert (sadly), and \"custody\" doesn't involve keeping someone locked in a cupboard (double sadly).", "normalised": "First off, the lingo.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the paperwork. Oh, the paperwork! Forms in triplicate, affidavits longer than my arm, financial statements that would make even a chartered accountant weep. I think I single-handedly saved the Indian paper industry with my divorce proceedings. I had to list every asset, from my ₹5000 savings account to my prized collection of vintage comics.

{"unnormalised": "The courtroom itself was like a scene from a bad Bollywood movie. Dramatic pronouncements, hushed whispers, and enough tension to cut with a butter knife. I half-expected someone to burst into song and dance at any moment. My ex's lawyer, a Mr. Kapoor with a perfectly coiffed mustache, looked like he'd stepped straight out of a 70s film. He kept referring to me as \"a man consumed by frivolous hobbies\" which, honestly, is a fair assessment.", "normalised": "The courtroom itself was like a scene from a bad Bollywood movie.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of my ex, let's just say things were... heated. We haggled over everything, from the ownership of the microwave to who got to keep the dog (a fluffy Pomeranian named Princess Leia, naturally).
