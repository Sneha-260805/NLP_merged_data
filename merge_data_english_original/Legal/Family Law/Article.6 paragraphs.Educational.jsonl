{"unnormalised": "Family Law in India is a complex area, deeply rooted in religious and cultural traditions. Unlike many Western countries with a uniform civil code, India's approach is multifaceted, with different laws applying based on the individual's religion. For instance, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 governs marriage, divorce, and inheritance for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. Meanwhile, Muslims are governed by Muslim Personal Law, often referred to as Sharia Law, which addresses these matters based on Islamic principles. Christians have the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. This divergence creates a fascinating, yet often challenging, legal landscape.", "normalised": "Family Law in India is a complex area, deeply rooted in religious and cultural traditions.

{"unnormalised": "Adoption laws are primarily governed by the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The latter is secular and allows individuals of any religion to adopt. Guardianship of a minor child is typically decided by considering the child's welfare. Property inheritance is another area of considerable variation. Hindu Succession Act, 1956, deals with inheritance for Hindus, and amendments in 2005 granted equal rights to daughters in ancestral property. Muslim law follows Sharia principles, often resulting in different inheritance shares for male and female heirs. A will can supersede these laws.", "normalised": "Adoption laws are primarily governed by the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, one thousand nine hundred and fifty six, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, two thousand and fifteen.
