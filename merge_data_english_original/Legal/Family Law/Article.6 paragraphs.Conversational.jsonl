{"unnormalised": "Family law in India, unlike many other areas of law, isn't governed by a single, uniform code. Instead, we have different sets of laws for different religious communities. For Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a key piece of legislation. Muslims have their own personal laws derived from Islamic jurisprudence. Christians are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, and Parsis by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936. It can get a little complicated, right?", "normalised": "Family law in India, unlike many other areas of law, isn't governed by a single, uniform code.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most common areas covered by family law is marriage. Things like the conditions for a valid marriage, registration of marriage, and even the rights and obligations of spouses fall under its umbrella. The legal age for marriage in India is 18 for women and 21 for men, as per the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. However, many cases of underage marriage, particularly in rural areas, still exist. Did you know that registering your marriage is really important, even if it's a love marriage or an arranged one? It helps in so many legal processes later on.", "normalised": "One of the most common areas covered by family law is marriage.

{"unnormalised": "Divorce is another biggie. Different laws prescribe different grounds for divorce. For instance, under the Hindu Marriage Act, grounds include cruelty, desertion, adultery, conversion, and incurable unsoundness of mind. There's also the concept of mutual consent divorce, where both husband and wife agree to end the marriage. Remember that case, Anita Sharma vs. Rohan Verma, in the Delhi High Court back in '18? That was a landmark ruling on mutual consent!", "normalised": "Divorce is another biggie. Different laws prescribe different grounds for divorce.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody is another hot topic. The court’s primary concern is always the welfare of the child. Generally, mothers get preference when the child is young, especially if they’re below 5 yrs. But it really depends on the individual circumstances. For instance, if the mother is deemed unfit due to reasons like mental instability or substance abuse, the father might get custody. Legal battles over custody can be emotionally draining and financially taxing, often costing upwards of Rs. 50,000 to pursue.", "normalised": "Child custody is another hot topic.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of maintenance, which is financial support provided to a spouse (usually the wife) after separation or divorce. Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) provides for maintenance, and the amount is determined by the court based on factors like the husband's income and the wife's needs. A recent ruling clarified that even a working woman can claim maintenance if her income isn't sufficient to maintain the same standard of living she had during the marriage.", "normalised": "Then there's the issue of maintenance, which is financial support provided to a spouse (usually the wife) after separation or divorce.
