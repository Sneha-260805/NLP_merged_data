{"unnormalised": "The initial cracks appeared subtly. Disagreements over finances escalated. Soon, the once-loving home transformed into a battleground. When things spiralled beyond repair, Priya decided to file for divorce. That’s when the labyrinth of legal procedures began. First, she needed a lawyer. Adv. Verma, recommended by a friend, seemed competent. He charged Rs. 15,000 for the initial consultation and advised her on Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the relevant section for divorce on grounds of cruelty.", "normalised": "The initial cracks appeared subtly.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody became a particularly painful point. Priya wanted Rohan to stay with her, naturally. Her husband, however, demanded joint custody. Several hearings later, the court granted Priya primary custody but allowed her husband visitation rights every other weekend.
