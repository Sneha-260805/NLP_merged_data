{"unnormalised": "One key amendment concerns Section 13, which deals with grounds for divorce. Traditionally, the HMA stipulated fault-based divorce, requiring proof of adultery, cruelty, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. However, recent amendments have introduced concepts like “irretrievable breakdown of marriage” as a valid ground, although its implementation remains complex. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in several landmark judgments, has emphasized the need for a pragmatic approach, recognizing that forcing couples to remain married when the relationship is beyond repair serves no purpose. The case of *Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli* (Civil Appeal No. 1595 of 2004) highlighted this issue, urging lawmakers to formally incorporate irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce.", "normalised": "One key amendment concerns Section thirteen, which deals with grounds for divorce.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, Section 125 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure), which pertains to maintenance, has seen judicial expansion. While traditionally focused on wives unable to maintain themselves, recent rulings have broadened the scope to include husbands under certain circumstances. The courts have acknowledged that societal roles are evolving, and men may also require financial support in cases of disability or inability to earn. The amount of maintenance awarded is usually decided by the court after careful consideration of multiple factors, like monthly income of both the spouses, their expenses, their social status and sometimes even conduct. A recent case in the Delhi High Court awarded a disabled husband Rs. 15,000/month as interim maintenance from his earning wife.", "normalised": "Furthermore, Section one hundred and twenty five of the C-R-P-C (Code of Criminal Procedure), which pertains to maintenance, has seen judicial expansion.

{"unnormalised": "Another pertinent area of family law involves property rights post-divorce. Although the HMA doesn't explicitly deal with division of property, Indian courts often rely on principles of equity and justice. The concept of “streedhan” (women's property acquired before, during, or after marriage) is crucial. Courts generally ensure that streedhan is returned to the wife. The division of jointly owned assets, including real estate and investments, is usually decided on a case-by-case basis, considering contributions made by each spouse. Legal experts like Adv. Meera Patel often advise clients to maintain clear documentation of financial contributions to avoid disputes during divorce proceedings. It is to be noted that in case a wife has invested in a property along with her husband, she is liable to get it back.", "normalised": "Another pertinent area of family law involves property rights post-divorce.

{"unnormalised": "Amendments have also touched upon issues of child custody. Section 26 of the HMA empowers courts to make interim orders regarding custody, education, and maintenance of children. The “best interests of the child” principle remains paramount. Courts consider factors like the child’s preference (if mature enough), the parents' capacity to provide a nurturing environment, and the child's emotional well-being. Shared parenting arrangements are increasingly being favored, allowing both parents to actively participate in the child’s upbringing. Cases like *Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal* (2009) illustrate the judiciary's emphasis on minimizing the disruption to a child's life during divorce.", "normalised": "Amendments have also touched upon issues of child custody.

{"unnormalised": "The Special Marriage Act of 1954 also sees it's own share of amendments which relate to inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. These acts govern the validity of marriages of spouses belonging to two different communities or religions. Section 5 states clearly the conditions of solemnization of marriage under the Act.", "normalised": "The Special Marriage Act of nineteen fifty four also sees its own share of amendments which relate to inter-caste and inter-religious marriages.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, understanding the implications of Section 498A of the IPC (Indian Penal Code), which deals with cruelty towards women by their husbands or relatives, is essential. While intended to protect women from domestic violence, the law has faced criticism for alleged misuse. The Supreme Court has issued guidelines to prevent false accusations, emphasizing the need for preliminary inquiries before arrests are made. This is because many women mis-report these cases which gives rise to another problem altogether.", "normalised": "Furthermore, understanding the implications of Section four hundred and ninety eight A of the I-P-C (Indian Penal Code), which deals with cruelty towards women by their husbands or relatives, is essential.
