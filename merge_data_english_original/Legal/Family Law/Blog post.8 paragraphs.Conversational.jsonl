{"unnormalised": "First off, marriage! In India, marriages are governed by personal laws, meaning laws based on religion. Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis – each community has its own set of rules. For instance, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, outlines conditions for a valid Hindu marriage, including consent and no prior existing marriage. Did you know registration of marriage is becoming increasingly important? Especially when it comes to things like applying for a VISA later on.", "normalised": "First off, marriage!

{"unnormalised": "Divorce is another biggie. Grounds for divorce vary across religions. Common grounds include cruelty, adultery, desertion, and conversion. A mutual consent divorce, where both parties agree to separate, is generally the fastest way.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody battles? Heartbreaking. The child's welfare is the top priority. Courts often consider factors like the child's preference (if they’re old enough), the parent’s financial stability, and their ability to provide a nurturing environment. Joint custody is becoming more common, allowing both parents to be involved in the child’s life. Sec 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with child custody.", "normalised": "Child custody battles?
