(India Specific)", "normalised": "Hey Reddit fam, I'm kinda stuck in a messy situation and need some unbiased opinions. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I (thirty five M) am getting divorced from Priya (thirty three F). We were married for eight years. No kids, thankfully, considering how things are going. The divorce itself is amicable, kinda, but the property division is turning into a huge headache."}

When he passed away in two thousand and five, it was divided equally between my father and his two brothers, according to the Hindu Succession Act, one thousand nine hundred and fifty six. Later, my father built a house on his share, borrowing some money to do so. After my father’s passing in two thousand and eighteen, that house legally became my property, as well as inherited savings, detailed in his will."}

Her argument is that she contributed to the \"family welfare\" during our marriage. I mean, she had a good job and she did do some chores, but all her income was used on herself. I did not ask for any money from her. She worked as a lecturer at a private college and made around rupees forty thousand per month, whereas I worked in I-T and had a salary that was rupees one hundred and fifty thousand a month. She even cites Section one hundred and twenty five of the C-r-P-C (Criminal Procedure Code) about maintenance, but that’s for wives who are unable to maintain themselves!"}
