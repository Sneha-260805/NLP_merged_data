{"unnormalised": "Alright, let's talk family law in India. It’s a bit of a maze, especially if you’re not a lawyer, right? So, here's a simple breakdown, focusing mainly on the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, since that’s what applies to a large chunk of the population. But remember, personal laws differ based on religion. For Muslims, it's the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. For Christians, the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, and so on. Don’t mix them up!", "normalised": "alright, let's talk family law in India. it's a bit of a maze, especially if you're not a lawyer, right? so, here's a simple breakdown, focusing mainly on the Hindu Marriage Act, one thousand nine hundred and fifty five, since that's what applies to a large chunk of the population. but remember, personal laws differ based on religion. for Muslims, it's the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, one thousand nine hundred and thirty seven. for Christians, the Indian Christian Marriage Act, one thousand eight hundred and seventy two, and so on. don't mix them up!"}
{"unnormalised": "First off, marriage. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, you gotta be of sound mind, not already married (bigamy is a no-no!), and of age (boys 21 yrs, girls 18 yrs, typically). Cousins marrying? Tricky, depends on your custom. If all clear, you’re legally hitched. Divorce? Sadly, it happens. There are grounds for divorce, like cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, insanity, leprosy, venereal disease, renunciation, or presumed death. Section 13 covers that in detail. Filing for divorce can take ages, often running for 2+ years.", "normalised": "first off, marriage. under the Hindu Marriage Act, you gotta be of sound mind, not already married (bigamy is a no-no!), and of age (boys twenty one years, girls eighteen years, typically). cousins marrying? tricky, depends on your custom. if all clear, you're legally hitched. divorce? sadly, it happens. there are grounds for divorce, like cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, insanity, leprosy, venereal disease, renunciation, or presumed death. section thirteen covers that in detail. filing for divorce can take ages, often running for two plus years."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there’s maintenance. What happens when the marriage ends? Well, the financially weaker spouse can claim maintenance from the other under Section 125 CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). This isn't just for wives; husbands can also claim if they're unable to support themselves. The amount depends on various factors, like income, assets, and living standards. Some cases drag on for years, costing lakhs!", "normalised": "then there's maintenance. what happens when the marriage ends? well, the financially weaker spouse can claim maintenance from the other under section one hundred and twenty five C-R-P-C (Code of Criminal Procedure). this isn't just for wives; husbands can also claim if they're unable to support themselves. the amount depends on various factors, like income, assets, and living standards. some cases drag on for years, costing lakhs!"}
{"unnormalised": "Child custody? A sensitive one. Courts prioritize the child’s welfare above all else. Usually, the mother gets custody of younger children, but it's not a hard and fast rule. The court considers the child's wishes, too, if they're old enough to express them. Joint custody is becoming more common, where both parents share responsibility. Grandparents also often play a vital role in childcare.", "normalised": "child custody? a sensitive one. courts prioritize the child's welfare above all else. usually, the mother gets custody of younger children, but it's not a hard and fast rule. the court considers the child's wishes, too, if they're old enough to express them. joint custody is becoming more common, where both parents share responsibility. grandparents also often play a vital role in childcare."}
{"unnormalised": "Dowry. Officially illegal, thanks to the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. But sadly, it still happens. Giving or taking dowry is a crime, and there are hefty penalties involved, like fines up to Rs. 15,000 or jail time. Complaints under Section 498A IPC (Indian Penal Code) are often filed, alleging harassment for dowry. However, sometimes these cases are misused, so be careful.", "normalised": "dowry. officially illegal, thanks to the Dowry Prohibition Act, one thousand nine hundred and sixty one. but sadly, it still happens. giving or taking dowry is a crime, and there are hefty penalties involved, like fines up to rupees fifteen thousand or jail time. complaints under section four hundred and ninety eight A I-P-C (Indian Penal Code) are often filed, alleging harassment for dowry. however, sometimes these cases are misused, so be careful."}
{"unnormalised": "Domestic violence is another serious issue. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides legal recourse for women facing physical, emotional, verbal, or economic abuse within the household.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, inheritance. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended in 2005), gives equal rights to daughters in ancestral property. Before that, it was mainly sons who inherited. Now, daughters have the same rights as sons. This applies to self-acquired property too, but rules are different if there’s a will. Wills are important, folks! Consult a lawyer to get one made to avoid property disputes later, costing a fortune in legal fees.", "normalised": "finally, inheritance.
