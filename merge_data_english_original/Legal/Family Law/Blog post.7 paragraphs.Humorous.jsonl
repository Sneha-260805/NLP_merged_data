{"unnormalised": "Okay folks, buckle up, because Auntiji's spilling the chai on a topic no one likes, but everyone kinda deals with: family law, specifically divorce. Now, before you picture me sobbing into my saree, chill. This isn't *my* drama. But I’ve seen enough courtroom theatrics to rival a Bollywood film. And trust me, those divorce lawyers are like the Karan Johar of the legal world – dramatic, stylish, and always stirring the pot.", "normalised": "Okay folks, buckle up, because Auntiji's spilling the chai on a topic no one likes, but everyone kinda deals with: family law, specifically divorce.

{"unnormalised": "First things first: the dreaded Section 498A. Aka, the wife’s revenge. Every husband in India fears this section of the IPC. It’s usually filed with more spice than your average vindaloo and, honestly, sometimes it's justified. Other times, well, let’s just say somebody’s maa is putting ideas into her bahu's head after watching too much Zee TV. My neighbour Suresh, he’s sweating bullets after his biwi threatened to file this. He gave her a diamond nose ring (Rs. 50,000 ka!) and bought her that imported sari from Banaras. But, apparently, she wants a vacation to Switzerland. #IndianWifeGoals.", "normalised": "First things first: the dreaded Section four hundred and ninety eight A. A-k-a, the wife’s revenge.

{"unnormalised": "Then you’ve got the alimony negotiations. Oh, the drama! It’s like a never-ending episode of Shark Tank, but with more tears and less valuation. I once saw a husband argue that he shouldn’t have to pay so much because his wife spent all their money on “pointless things,” like her mother's medical bills. Sir, seriously? Also, what IS a reasonable amount these days anyway? Heard someone got 20% of their husband's salary for life. Life!", "normalised": "Then you’ve got the alimony negotiations. Oh, the drama!

{"unnormalised": "Child custody battles? Heartbreaking. Imagine two people, who once couldn't keep their hands off each other, now fighting tooth and nail over little Rohan. The judge is basically Solomon, trying to figure out who gets the baby, minus the whole splitting-him-in-half thing. Although, after hearing some of these cases, I wouldn't blame him if he suggested it. Rohan's cricket coaching (Rs. 15,000 monthly) and school fees are at stake, people!

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the *khandan* (extended family). Everyone’s got an opinion, nobody’s shy about sharing it. \"Beta, you should try to work things out,\" they say, while simultaneously gossiping about your marital issues to every Sharmaji and Vermaji in the colony. A divorce in India is still a “log kya kahenge?” situation, even in 2024! It's like everyone expects you to just grin and bear it, even if your spouse is using your toothbrush to clean the toilet. Nope, not on my watch.", "normalised": "And let's not forget the *khandan* (extended family).

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, the entire process is slower than a government office on a Monday morning. You’ll spend more time in court waiting rooms than you will actually talking to the judge.

If you’re thinking about a divorce, get a good lawyer (and maybe a therapist). And for the love of all that is holy, pre-nup! It’s like an insurance policy against marital madness. You’ll thank me later. Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear my neighbour shouting.
