{"unnormalised": "Family law in India, folks, is a bit like a Bollywood movie – full of twists, turns, melodrama, and the occasional item number (usually involving property disputes). It’s a fascinating field, governed by a mix of personal laws based on religion, which means what’s kosher for Priya might be strictly *not allowed* for Fatima. Think of it as legal multiple choice, but with far higher stakes than your 10th-grade board exams.", "normalised": "Family law in India, folks, is a bit like a Bollywood movie – full of twists, turns, melodrama, and the occasional item number (usually involving property disputes).

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk marriage. Getting hitched is easy! Just find someone willing, print a few cards, and blow half your life savings on a wedding reception. But disentangling yourself? That's where the fun *really* begins. Divorce in India, especially contested divorce, can be a longer process than waiting for your local municipal corporation to fix a pothole. We're talking years. And potentially, if you are unlucky and fight hard, you might end up paying more to your advocate than you spent on the wedding to begin with! (Rs. 20 lakhs easily!)", "normalised": "Now, let's talk marriage. Getting hitched is easy! Just find someone willing, print a few cards, and blow half your life savings on a wedding reception.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the matter of maintenance. Imagine this: you’ve finally broken free from the marital bonds, only to find yourself paying your ex-spouse enough money each month to fund a small European vacation. Section 125 of the CrPC is a real thing, and it is often interpreted in the most creative ways. \"Your honour, he promised me the moon and stars! Now I demand monthly alimony equivalent to 10% of his income from his consulting firm, ABC Consultants Pvt. Ltd.\" Good luck arguing against that!", "normalised": "And then there's the matter of maintenance.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody? Oh, that's another can of worms entirely. Picture two parents, each convinced they are the reincarnation of Mother Teresa and Superdad rolled into one. The court gets to play referee, deciding who gets to shape the future of little Rohan or Aisha. It's like a high-stakes game of emotional chess, where the pawns are actual children. It's also important to note that Child custody petitions can take anywhere between 2-5 years to resolve depending on which Court you approach. The Family Court in Bandra, Mumbai, for instance, has a massive backlog.", "normalised": "Child custody? Oh, that's another can of worms entirely.
