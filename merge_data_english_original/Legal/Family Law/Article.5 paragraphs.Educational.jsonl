{"unnormalised": "Family law in India is a complex area governing personal matters such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and child custody. Unlike many other areas of law, family law is not uniform across the country. Instead, it’s primarily governed by personal laws, which are based on religious affiliation. For Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains, the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 are key statutes. Muslims are governed by Muslim Personal Law, which is largely uncodified and based on religious texts and interpretations. Christians are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, and the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. These differences often lead to complexities and variations in how family law matters are addressed in different communities.", "normalised": "Family law in India is a complex area governing personal matters such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and child custody.

{"unnormalised": "Marriage under Indian family law has specific requirements. The legal age for marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females. The Hindu Marriage Act requires that parties be of sound mind and not have a prior subsisting marriage. The Special Marriage Act of 1954 allows inter-religious marriages to take place, requiring a 30-day notice period before solemnization. Registration of marriages is becoming increasingly common and is governed by state-specific registration acts. Instances of child marriages, although illegal, still occur, particularly in rural areas. NGOs like the Bal Raksha Bharat are working towards eradicating this practice.", "normalised": "Marriage under Indian family law has specific requirements.

{"unnormalised": "Divorce procedures also vary depending on personal law. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, divorce can be obtained through mutual consent (Section 13B) or on specific grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, conversion, or incurable mental illness (Section 13). The Muslim Personal Law provides for various forms of divorce including Talaq-e-Hasan, Talaq-e-Ahsan, and Talaq-e-Biddat (which has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2017). The Indian Divorce Act for Christians outlines similar grounds, often requiring a longer separation period before a divorce can be granted. Maintenance, under Section 125 of CrPC, is applicable irrespective of religion.", "normalised": "Divorce procedures also vary depending on personal law.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody is another significant aspect of family law. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. Courts often consider factors like the child's preference (if the child is of a mature age), the financial stability of each parent, and the emotional well-being that each parent can provide. Typically, mothers are often given preference for custody of young children, especially below 5 yrs of age. Guardianship laws also differ based on religion, with the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, being key legislations.", "normalised": "Child custody is another significant aspect of family law.

{"unnormalised": "Inheritance laws also vary, especially with respect to ancestral property. The Hindu Succession Act provides for equal rights to daughters in ancestral property after the 2005 amendment. Muslim Personal Law dictates specific shares for different family members, with daughters generally receiving half the share of sons. Wills and testaments are also recognized, allowing individuals to bequeath their property according to their wishes, subject to certain legal limitations and family considerations. The Indian Succession Act, 1925, governs testamentary succession for those not covered by personal laws. Understanding these laws can be crucial for individuals planning their estates.", "normalised": "Inheritance laws also vary, especially with respect to ancestral property.
