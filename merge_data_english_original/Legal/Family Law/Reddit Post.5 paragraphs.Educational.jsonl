{"unnormalised": "First off, marriage registration is crucial. While not *mandatory* across the board, registering under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, or the Special Marriage Act, 1954, provides clear legal standing. Think of it as your official \"we're married\" certificate. Without it, things get complicated, especially if you ever need to deal with property rights or inheritance issues down the line.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole issue of divorce. Under Hindu law, grounds for divorce include things like adultery, cruelty, and desertion. A petition has to be filed, sometimes taking 6 months or even 1 yr. to process in the lower courts. If you're a Muslim, divorce can be initiated through different methods, including talaq. Understanding the specific laws applicable to your religion is essential. There's also the option of mutual consent divorce, which is generally faster, but both parties have to agree, obviously. Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act is what governs that.", "normalised": "Then there is the whole issue of divorce.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody is another huge aspect. The court's primary concern is the child's welfare, so they'll consider factors like the parent's financial stability, emotional well-being, and the child's preference (if they're old enough).

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, don't forget about maintenance (alimony). In many cases, the wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband, especially if she's unable to support herself. The amount is determined by the court, considering factors like the husband's income, the wife's needs, and their standard of living during the marriage. Section 125 of the CrPC also provides for maintenance for wives, children, and parents who are unable to maintain themselves. It's a safety net during a difficult time. I hope this helped!
