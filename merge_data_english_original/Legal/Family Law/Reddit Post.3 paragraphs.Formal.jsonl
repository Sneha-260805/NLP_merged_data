{"unnormalised": "The main point of contention is the alimony and child custody. Rakesh is arguing that Aisha is employed and earns Rs. 50,000 per month, so she doesn't need a large alimony payment. He also wants joint custody of the child. Aisha, on the other hand, claims that her expenses are higher, and she needs at least Rs. 25,000 per month in alimony to maintain a reasonable standard of living. She is also seeking sole custody, citing Rakesh's work schedule as a reason he wouldn't be available to properly care for the child. They did not sign any prenuptial agreement before their marriage.", "normalised": "The main point of contention is the alimony and child custody.

Also, what are the chances of Aisha getting sole custody, considering the child's age and Rakesh's claims? Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.
