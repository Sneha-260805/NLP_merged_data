{"unnormalised": "Family law, *yaar*, it’s like a Bollywood movie – full of drama, emotion, and enough plot twists to make your head spin! But instead of *filmi* villains and romantic heroes, you've got courts, lawyers, and the law itself. For us common folk, trying to understand it all can feel like trying to decipher ancient Sanskrit. So, let’s break it down a bit, *haan*?", "normalised": "Family law, yaar, it’s like a Bollywood movie – full of drama, emotion, and enough plot twists to make your head spin!

{"unnormalised": "First off, what *is* family law, exactly? Think of it as the rulebook for all things related to family – marriage, divorce, child custody, adoption, property division... you name it! In India, things get a little more complicated because different religions have their own sets of rules for some of these matters. For example, Hindu marriage is governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, while Muslims have their own personal law. And the Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows people from different religions to marry. Confusing, right?", "normalised": "First off, what is family law, exactly?

{"unnormalised": "Divorce is often the first thing that comes to mind when we think about family law. Now, getting a divorce isn't as simple as signing a paper. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, you generally need to prove grounds for divorce – things like cruelty, adultery, or desertion. If both parties agree, you can go for a \"divorce by mutual consent.\" This usually takes at least 6 months, sometimes even longer, Adv. Sharma told me it can drag on for yrs depending on the backlog in court.", "normalised": "Divorce is often the first thing that comes to mind when we think about family law.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody battles? Oof. These are probably the most emotionally charged cases. The court's main concern is always the \"best interests of the child.\" This means they’ll consider things like the child's wishes (if they're old enough), the parents' ability to provide a stable environment, and which parent is more likely to support the child's relationship with the other parent. A friend of mine, Priya, had a tough time when her ex demanded full custody. Thankfully the court awarded her custody on 12/1/2023, because her child was only 5 yrs old.", "normalised": "Child custody battles? Oof. These are probably the most emotionally charged cases.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole issue of property division. Again, the rules vary depending on the laws that apply to you. Generally, the property acquired during the marriage is considered marital property and is divided equitably (though not always equally) between the spouses. But this doesn't mean a 50/50 split of every *paisa*. Judges take many factors into account, things like who bought what and when.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole issue of property division.

{"unnormalised": "Maintenance, or alimony, is another key aspect. This is the money one spouse pays to the other after a divorce to help them maintain a reasonable standard of living. The amount and duration of maintenance depend on factors like the spouses' income, assets, and living standards during the marriage. The court order specified a monthly payment of ₹15000.", "normalised": "Maintenance, or alimony, is another key aspect.
