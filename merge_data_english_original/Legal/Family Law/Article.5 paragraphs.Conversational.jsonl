{"unnormalised": "Now, divorce. This is where things *really* get interesting. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, both parties need to prove grounds for divorce, like cruelty, adultery, or desertion. But there's also a provision for divorce by mutual consent, which is generally faster and less messy. Important to remember: Section 13B requires a waiting period of 6 months (sometimes waived by the courts) after filing the initial petition. My friend Priya’s divorce took almost 2 yrs because of property disputes!", "normalised": "Now, divorce. This is where things really get interesting.

{"unnormalised": "Child custody battles can be especially tough. The court's primary concern is always the child's welfare. They’ll consider things like the child's preference (if they’re old enough to express it), the parents' financial stability, and their ability to provide a loving and supportive environment. Don’t think you can just show up and demand custody; prepare to present your case. Advocate Sharma from my law college days always emphasized “best interests of the child\" in such cases.", "normalised": "Child custody battles can be especially tough.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, there’s the matter of property. In a divorce, jointly owned property is typically divided equally. But what about property owned individually *before* the marriage? That gets more complex and depends on the specific circumstances and applicable laws. Make sure you consult a lawyer to understand your rights! Even a simple consultation fee of Rs. 2000 could save you lacs in the long run. Consider it an investment in your future sanity!", "normalised": "Finally, there’s the matter of property.
