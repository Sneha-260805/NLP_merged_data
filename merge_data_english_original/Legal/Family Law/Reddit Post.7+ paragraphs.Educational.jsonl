{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit, long-time lurker, first-time poster. I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and wanted to get some perspective, especially from those familiar with Indian family law.", "normalised": "So, here's the background: My family has some ancestral property in Lucknow. It's been in our family for generations. My brother, Rohan, got married to Priya back in two thousand and fifteen. They had a love marriage and everyone was very happy. Unfortunately, things went south, and they're now getting divorced. It's a messy one, with allegations of mental cruelty from both sides. Rohan's lawyer is saying that Priya is now entitled to a share of *everything*, including the ancestral property."}

It's been in our family for literally hundreds of years. It's not something Rohan acquired during the marriage. It was inherited. My parents are devastated, not only by the divorce but also by the potential loss of a piece of our family history. The property is worth approximately rupee two point five crore. I've been taking care of my parents since they retired back in two thousand and twenty, and the property could provide a safety net for them."}

Generally, if Rohan inherits the property *before* the divorce, it is considered his. However, Priya can claim a share if she can prove she contributed to its upkeep or improvement, even indirectly. She was a homemaker for seven years."}

Will their spouses also claim a share of our ancestral home? My wife thinks I'm being too harsh and that Priya deserves something for the years she spent with Rohan. She says Rohan should provide for her from his own earnings, not from family assets. She mentioned that Section one hundred and twenty five of the C-r-P-C might come into play, entitling Priya to maintenance."}
