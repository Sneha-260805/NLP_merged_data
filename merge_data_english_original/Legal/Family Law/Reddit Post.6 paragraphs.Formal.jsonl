{"unnormalised": "The issue started when I brought up the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement. My reasoning is purely practical. I’ve accumulated a fair amount of assets (around Rs. 1.5 Cr in savings and investments) before we even met, and I want to ensure that these are protected, especially considering the rising divorce rates these days and the complexities of family law in India. I mentioned that it's not about distrusting her, but about having a clear understanding of asset division in case something unfortunate happens down the line. I even suggested that we both get independent legal Adv. representation (with fees borne by me) to ensure fairness and transparency.", "normalised": "The issue started when I brought up the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement.
