{"unnormalised": "So, you're thinking about getting married in India? Or perhaps, *un*-married? Buckle up, buttercup, because family law here is less like a straight highway and more like the Delhi Ring Road during peak hours – chaotic, unpredictable, and definitely requires a strong horn (or, in this case, a good lawyer!). You might hear about Sec 125 CrPC like it's a magic spell but be warned, it needs to be chanted correctly!", "normalised": "So, you are thinking about getting married in India?

{"unnormalised": "First off, let’s talk marriage. Forget about eloping to Vegas; here, it's a full-blown production starring your relatives, a pandit, and enough food to feed a small army. Be sure you check the legal age (21 for men, 18 for women) and make sure you have all your documents in order like your Aadhar card, PAN card, and school certificate. If you're from different religions, things get interesting with the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Think of it as the “diplomatic immunity” for your relationship, but with paperwork.", "normalised": "First off, let’s talk marriage.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's say the happily-ever-after turned into a happily-never-again. Divorce in India is… complicated. We have Hindu Marriage Act 1955, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 and so on, each with its own set of rules. Mutual consent divorce is relatively straightforward (think of it as the \"express lane\"), but contested divorces can drag on longer than a Bollywood movie. Alimony, or maintenance, is often a hot topic, with courts deciding based on income, lifestyle, and who broke whose favorite chai cup. The courts might award something like Rs. 50,000 per month, but don't quote me on that.", "normalised": "Now, let us say the happily-ever-after turned into a happily-never-again.

Courts prioritize the child's welfare, but sometimes you’d think the parents are auditioning for an Oscar with their emotional pleas. Shared custody is becoming more common, but remember, the goal is to raise happy, well-adjusted kids, not to win a legal battle. Lawyers will often recommend consulting a child psychologist for a nominal fee of Rs. 2500, but parents are often hesitant.", "normalised": "And then there is child custody, the ultimate tug-of-war.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, a word to the wise: family law in India is constantly evolving. So, before you make any big decisions, consult a lawyer. Think of them as your GPS, guiding you through the maze of legal jargon and procedures. And remember, a little humor and a lot of patience can go a long way in navigating these often-tumultuous waters. You might just need a stiff drink of 'nimbu pani' after dealing with your 498A case. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favour!", "normalised": "Finally, a word to the wise: family law in India is constantly evolving. So, before you make any big decisions, consult a lawyer.
