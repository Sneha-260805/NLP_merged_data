{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest issues was the property division. They had a flat in Bandra, Mumbai, bought jointly after their marriage, around 2010. Rakesh claimed it was technically his, as his dad contributed 50% of the down payment. Priya was adamant that since they both paid the EMIs for almost 10 years, it should be considered joint property. That’s where the legal headaches began.

Rakesh, fueled by his family, argued that Priya was \"too modern\" and wouldn’t be able to raise Aryan with proper \"sanskaar\". Priya, on the other hand, was worried about Aryan’s well-being in a rural setting without access to good education and healthcare facilities. Plus, she alleged emotional abuse by Rakesh's mother.
