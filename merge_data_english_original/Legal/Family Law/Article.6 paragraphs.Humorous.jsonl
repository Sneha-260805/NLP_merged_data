{"unnormalised": "Family law, a field where emotions run higher than the humidity in Chennai during peak summer! It’s a fascinating area, particularly in India, where family dramas unfold with all the plot twists of a Bollywood blockbuster and legal jargon that's as complex as a Rubik's Cube. Whether it's a divorce, custody battle, or property dispute, it's rarely a walk in the park, more like a mad dash through a minefield. So, grab a cup of chai, sit back, and let's dissect some hilarious (and sometimes infuriating) aspects of Indian family law.", "normalised": "Family law, a field where emotions run higher than the humidity in Chennai during peak summer!

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest sources of amusement (and despair) is the glacial pace of the Indian legal system. A divorce case filed in 2015 might only see the light of day in 2025. By then, both parties have probably forgotten why they wanted a divorce in the first place and have moved on to blaming their lawyer. It's like ordering a pizza and receiving it a decade later. The hunger's gone, the pizza's stale, and you're left wondering what you even ordered!

While illegal under the Dowry Prohibition Act, it still rears its ugly head in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways.

Uncles and aunties emerge from the woodwork, claiming their share of the pie. Legal documents from 1947 are dug up, dusted off, and used as ammunition. It’s like a real-life game of \"Monopoly\" where the stakes are high, the friendships are low, and everyone ends up losing (except the lawyers, of course!).
