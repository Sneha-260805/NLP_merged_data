Basically, civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, not crimes (that’s criminal law, bhai!). Think property disagreements, like if your neighbour builds a wall encroaching on your land (a classic case!), or contractual issues, like if a builder doesn't finish your house according to the agreement and you’re stuck paying a hefty Rs. 50 lakhs for an incomplete dream home! It's all about rights and responsibilities, and trying to get compensation or specific actions to fix things.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about civil law, so thought I'd share a basic explanation.
