So, I thought I'd share a little breakdown, focusing on the Indian context. I'm no Adv. or anything, but I've done some research, and this is how I understand it.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, Civil Law deals with disputes between individuals or organisations. Think of it as resolving conflicts rather than punishing criminals – that's Criminal Law. The goal isn't jail time; it's usually compensation for damages or some kind of specific action. One common example is property disputes. Let's say Rohan's family has a plot of land in Gurgaon, and there's a disagreement with the neighbours about the boundary. This would fall under Civil Law. They might end up in court, and the judge would decide based on land records, witness testimonies, etc. – hopefully, resolving the issue without either party resorting to violence.", "normalised": "Basically, Civil Law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations.

{"unnormalised": "Another big area is contract law. If Priya signs a contract with a vendor for her wedding, and the vendor doesn't deliver as promised, Priya can sue for breach of contract. This is covered by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. This act is pretty old but still forms the backbone of contract enforcement. The court might order the vendor to pay Priya damages to cover the losses she incurred due to the breach. A rental agreement between a landlord Mr. Sharma and a tenant is also a type of contract that falls under the same act. Suppose that Mr. Sharma keeps raising the rent amount by 10% every month, which wasn't a part of the agreement that they both signed during the beginning. The tenant can legally sue Mr. Sharma for breaking the rental agreement.", "normalised": "Another big area is contract law.

{"unnormalised": "Consumer Protection is another important aspect. Let’s consider a situation where Aisha buys a new washing machine from \"Electronics India\" for Rs. 25000. If the machine malfunctions within the warranty period, and the company refuses to repair or replace it, Aisha can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. It is meant to protect consumers from unfair trade practices and defective products. The consumer courts are set up specifically to handle such cases, often offering a quicker and more affordable resolution compared to regular courts.", "normalised": "Consumer Protection is another important aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Divorce and family matters also fall under Civil Law, but it gets complicated because personal laws come into play. In India, marriage, divorce, inheritance are often governed by religious laws. If Rakesh and Sunita, who are Hindu, decide to get divorced, their case would be handled under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. If they were Muslim, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, would be relevant, though it's been subject to debates and legal challenges over the years. The court would decide issues like alimony, child custody, and division of property, keeping these personal laws in mind.", "normalised": "Divorce and family matters also fall under Civil Law, but it gets complicated because personal laws come into play.

{"unnormalised": "Torts, or civil wrongs, are also a significant part of Civil Law. If a company's negligence leads to someone getting injured, the injured party can sue for compensation.

The victim can claim medical expenses, loss of income, and pain and suffering as damages.", "normalised": "Torts, or civil wrongs, are also a significant part of Civil Law.

{"unnormalised": "One important thing to note is the burden of proof. In Civil cases, the plaintiff (the person bringing the case) has to prove their case \"on a preponderance of the evidence\". This is a lower standard than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" required in criminal cases. Basically, the plaintiff has to convince the court that it's more likely than not that their version of events is true. It is often a lengthy and stressful process and can take anything between 1 to 5 years for the judgement to be given, based on the intensity of the case.", "normalised": "One important thing to note is the burden of proof.
