{"unnormalised": "Criminal Law deals with offences against society. Think theft, murder, or even traffic violations. The State, represented by a Public Prosecutor, prosecutes the accused. If found guilty, punishments can range from fines to imprisonment. FIRs are filed, and investigations are conducted by the police. For example, Section 302 of the IPC deals with murder, and the police investigate, collect evidence, and file a charge sheet. A trial is held, and the judge decides the outcome based on the evidence presented.", "normalised": "Criminal Law deals with offences against society. Think theft, murder, or even traffic violations.

{"unnormalised": "Civil Law, on the other hand, is about disputes between individuals or organizations. It's about compensating for a wrong or enforcing a contract. Examples include property disputes, breach of contract, or divorce cases. Here, the person wronged (the plaintiff) files a suit against the wrongdoer (the defendant). The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the defendant caused them harm. For instance, if Mr. Sharma's neighbour encroaches on his land, Mr. Sharma can file a civil suit seeking Rs. 50,000 compensation and a court order to remove the encroachment.", "normalised": "Civil Law, on the other hand, is about disputes between individuals or organizations.

{"unnormalised": "So, the key difference lies in the nature of the wrong and the parties involved. Criminal law protects society as a whole, while civil law addresses individual grievances. The outcome in criminal cases is punishment, while in civil cases, it's usually compensation or specific performance (like fulfilling a contract). Understand Section 9 of CPC (Code of Civil Procedure) talks about court jurisdiction over civil matters, while CrPC deals criminal procedures.", "normalised": "So, the key difference lies in the nature of the wrong and the parties involved.
