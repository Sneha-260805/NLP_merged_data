Basically, it deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, where the aim is usually compensation or specific action rather than jail time. Think property disputes, like if your neighbour builds a wall encroaching on your land (Survey No. 123/4, for example). Or contract disagreements, like if someone doesn't pay you the agreed Rs. 50,000 for that old bike you sold them in Mar'23. Divorce cases and inheritance matters also fall under civil law, like dividing property amongst heirs after someone passes (as per Succession Act, 1956).", "normalised": "Someone asked me about Civil Law in India, and honestly, it's a pretty vast topic!

You'll often see abbreviations like \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" used in court documents.

Then comes the evidence presentation, witness testimonies, and finally, the judge's decision. Legal fees can vary widely, Adv.
