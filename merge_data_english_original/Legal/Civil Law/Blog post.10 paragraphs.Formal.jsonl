{"unnormalised": "One of the cornerstones of civil law is the law of contract. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, lays down the principles governing contracts, including offer, acceptance, consideration, and capacity to contract. Disputes arising from breach of contract, such as failure to deliver goods or services as agreed upon, are common civil law matters. A case might involve a supplier failing to deliver 1000 units of a product by the stipulated date, leading to a claim for damages.", "normalised": "One of the cornerstones of civil law is the law of contract.

{"unnormalised": "Torts, or civil wrongs, form a third important component. Tort law addresses acts or omissions that cause harm to another person, giving rise to a claim for damages. Examples include negligence, defamation, and trespass. A case of medical negligence, where a doctor's error leads to a patient's injury, would be a tort claim. Compensation can be sought under various provisions of the law.", "normalised": "Torts, or civil wrongs, form a third important component.
