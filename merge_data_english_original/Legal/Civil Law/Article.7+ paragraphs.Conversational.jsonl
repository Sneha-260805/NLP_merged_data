{"unnormalised": "Civil law, in simple terms, is like the rulebook for how we interact with each other as individuals, companies, or even the government when things aren't quite right. Think of it as the legal system's way of sorting out disagreements without involving criminal charges. Instead of jail time, civil law usually deals with compensation, orders to do something, or orders to stop doing something.", "normalised": "Civil law, in simple terms, is like the rulebook for how we interact with each other as individuals, companies, or even the government when things aren't quite right.

{"unnormalised": "Now, unlike criminal law that focuses on offenses against the state (like theft or murder), civil law zooms in on private disputes. Imagine Mr. Sharma's neighbour's tree falling onto his property, damaging his car. That's a civil wrong, and Mr. Sharma might file a case to recover the cost of repairs. Or perhaps Ms. Khan feels a company wrongly terminated her employment. She could file a case for wrongful dismissal and claim compensation.", "normalised": "Now, unlike criminal law that focuses on offenses against the state, like theft or murder, civil law zooms in on private disputes.

{"unnormalised": "So, what are some common areas covered by civil law in India? Contract law is a big one. Ever signed a rental agreement? That's contract law in action. Property law is another – anything related to buying, selling, or owning land or buildings falls under this. Then there’s tort law, which covers civil wrongs like negligence (say, a doctor's mistake during surgery leading to complications) or defamation (damaging someone's reputation with false statements). Family law, dealing with marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance, is also a significant branch of civil law.", "normalised": "So, what are some common areas covered by civil law in India?

{"unnormalised": "Let's talk about the process. Typically, a civil case starts with someone (the plaintiff) filing a lawsuit against someone else (the defendant) in the appropriate court. The court could be a district court, a high court, or even the Supreme Court, depending on the nature and value of the dispute. For example, a property dispute worth Rs. 50,000 might be handled by a lower court, whereas a complex commercial dispute involving crores might land in a high court.", "normalised": "Let's talk about the process.

{"unnormalised": "After the lawsuit is filed, the defendant gets a chance to respond. This is where they explain their side of the story. Evidence is then presented – documents, witness testimonies, expert opinions, the works. Cases like \"Mehta vs. Verma builders\" often rely heavily on expert witness testimonies. Judges then weigh all the evidence and arguments and make a decision.", "normalised": "After the lawsuit is filed, the defendant gets a chance to respond.

{"unnormalised": "If the plaintiff wins, the court might order the defendant to pay damages (money) to compensate for the loss or harm caused. They might also issue an injunction, which is a court order telling someone to do something or stop doing something. For instance, if someone is building an illegal structure on your land, the court might issue an injunction ordering them to stop. Judgements are often in the format \"Order passed on 15/08/2024\".", "normalised": "If the plaintiff wins, the court might order the defendant to pay damages, money, to compensate for the loss or harm caused.
