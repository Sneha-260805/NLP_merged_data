{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, hoping someone can ELI5 Civil Law in India for me. I'm trying to understand it better, especially how it differs from criminal law. I keep hearing terms like \"Section 9\" and \"Order 21 Rule 35\" thrown around, and I’m honestly lost. Like, if my neighbour, Mr. Sharma, builds an illegal extension to his house and it blocks my sunlight, would that fall under civil law? What kind of recourse do I have? Can I file some kind of \"suit\" and get some ₹ compensation?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, hoping someone can E-L-I-five Civil Law in India for me.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, civil law deals with disputes between private parties (individuals, companies, etc.). It’s all about rights and remedies.
