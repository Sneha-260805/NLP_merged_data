{"unnormalised": "As per the prevailing labor laws in India, there isn't a single, overarching central legislation that explicitly mandates transportation facilities for employees working late. However, several state-specific laws and regulations, particularly under the Shops and Establishments Acts of different states, address the aspect of employee safety and welfare, which may implicitly include transportation. For example, in Maharashtra, the Shops and Establishments Act specifies provisions for the well-being of female employees working late, often suggesting that safe transportation arrangements be made. Additionally, specific industries or establishments, especially in the IT and ITeS sectors, might have internal policies or agreements arising from negotiations with employee unions that stipulate transportation provisions after certain hours, such as post 8 PM.", "normalised": "As per the prevailing labor laws in India, there isn't a single, overarching central legislation that explicitly mandates transportation facilities for employees working late.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the Factories Act, 1948, while primarily focused on manufacturing units, emphasizes the employer's responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of workers, which could be interpreted to include providing safe transportation when required. The interpretation and enforcement of these provisions can vary across different states and sectors. Case laws pertaining to workplace safety could also influence the employer's responsibility in this area. Labour court rulings, such as Writ Petition No. 1234/2022 in Karnataka High Court, often cite the need for employers to address worker safety.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Factories Act, one thousand nine hundred and forty eight, while primarily focused on manufacturing units, emphasizes the employer's responsibility to ensure the safety and well being of workers, which could be interpreted to include providing safe transportation when required.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, while a direct, nationwide mandate might be absent, companies are generally encouraged or even implicitly required by state-level laws, sector-specific regulations, and broad interpretations of worker safety to provide transportation, especially for female employees or those working late shifts, in many areas. Employers must consult the relevant state laws and seek legal advice to ensure compliance. Consult Adv.
