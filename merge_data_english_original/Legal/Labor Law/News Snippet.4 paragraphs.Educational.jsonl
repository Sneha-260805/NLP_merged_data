{"unnormalised": "Another significant aspect of the potential reform pertains to the portability of EPF accounts. The ministry is exploring options to facilitate easier transfer of funds and service history when employees switch jobs. This is particularly relevant in sectors with high employee turnover, like IT and construction. Simplifying this process aims to reduce the administrative burden on both employees and employers. The existing procedure, involving Form 13 submission and attestation, is often perceived as cumbersome. The new system, if implemented, may allow online transfers via the UMANG app.", "normalised": "Another significant aspect of the potential reform pertains to the portability of E-P-F accounts.
