{"unnormalised": "One thing I'm super confused about is the whole concept of \"minimum wage\". Like, what exactly is the minimum wage in Karnataka right now? I saw somewhere it's around Rs. 15,000 per month, but is that really across the board? Some of our junior folks are making slightly less (Rs. 13,000-Rs. 14,000), but we provide accommodation and food, which is worth a fair bit, right?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole PF thing (Provident Fund). From what I understand, it's mandatory for companies with 20+ employees, which we now are. So, we need to register with the EPFO, contribute 12% from both the employer and employee side, deposit before 15th of every month, etc. Is that right? And what if someone wants to withdraw their PF before retirement, say for a medical emergency or something?

{"unnormalised": "Another thing that's been bugging me is the concept of \"contract labor\". We sometimes hire freelancers for short-term projects – like web designers or content writers.

{"unnormalised": "And what about termination rules? I've heard horror stories of companies firing employees without proper notice and then getting sued. What's the proper procedure in Karnataka?
