{"unnormalised": "Let's break it down a bit. Labour laws in India are essentially a set of rules designed to protect the rights and well-being of workers. They cover everything from wages and working hours to safety and social security. There are central laws like the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, which ensures that workers get at least a minimum amount (currently around Rs. 178 per day, though it varies by state – check your local laws!). Then there's the Factories Act, 1948, which is all about safety regulations in factories. It says things like, there must be a clearly marked emergency exit and regular safety checks. Not to forget the Employee's Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, mandating employers to contribute to a retirement fund for their employees. These are just a few examples, and believe me, there are plenty more.", "normalised": "Let's break it down a bit.

{"unnormalised": "Now, you might be thinking, \"Okay, that sounds complicated.\" And you're not wrong! But it doesn't have to be overwhelming. One of the first things you need to do is understand the different categories of workers. Are you hiring permanent employees, temporary workers, or contract laborers? The laws that apply to each category can be different. For instance, contract labourers usually don't have the same job security as permanent employees and are often governed by the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. Misclassifying your workers to avoid certain benefits is a big no-no and can lead to legal penalties. Imagine getting a notice from the Labour Commissioner because you didn't correctly classify 50 workers. Not fun!", "normalised": "Now, you might be thinking, \"Okay, that sounds complicated.\" And you're not wrong! But it doesn't have to be overwhelming.

Under the Employee's Compensation Act, 1923, you're obligated to provide him with compensation for his medical expenses and lost wages. Or let's say you're a tech startup in Bangalore and you're planning to lay off some employees due to financial constraints. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, lays down the procedure for retrenchment, including giving proper notice (usually 1 month) and paying severance compensation.
