{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me about labour laws in India, especially around firing employees. Okay, so basically, the rules depend on the size of the company and if the worker is a \"workman\" under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. If they are, it's much tougher to just fire them. You gotta follow procedure, give notice (like 1 month), and sometimes even pay retrenchment compensation, like 15 days' average pay for each completed year of service. This is especially true if you're talking about a large factory in Maharashtra or a big IT company in Bangalore with more than 100 employees.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about labor laws in India, especially around firing employees.

{"unnormalised": "Now, if the employee isn't a \"workman\" – like a manager or someone in a supervisory role – the rules are generally based on their employment contract. But even then, you can't just fire someone without a valid reason and proper notice. Labour courts are pretty active; employees can challenge unfair dismissals. Remember the case of Mr. Sharma from Gurgaon who fought his company after they fired him without a proper reason? He won! And got back pay.
