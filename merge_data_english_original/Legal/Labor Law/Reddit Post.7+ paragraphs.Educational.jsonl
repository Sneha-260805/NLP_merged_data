{"unnormalised": "Firstly, a lot of people get confused between different types of employment. Is it a permanent job, a fixed term contract, or are you considered an 'independent contractor'? This matters A LOT. A permanent employee, covered under various acts like the ESI Act, 1948, has way more protection than someone on a consultancy agreement. Think Gratuity, PF (Provident Fund), and job security. Consultant? Not so much. Check your offer letter and employment agreement very carefully. If you're unsure, seek legal counsel, Advocate Verma in Delhi can help.", "normalised": "Firstly, a lot of people get confused between different types of employment.

{"unnormalised": "Now, regarding termination. Say your company, XYZ Corp, decides to 'restructure' and you're let go. Labour law states certain conditions apply. They can’t just fire you on a whim. There needs to be a valid reason (like, real financial losses, not just because your manager doesn't like your chai drinking habits). And depending on how long you've worked there (usually 1 year+), you’re entitled to notice period (often 1-3 months) or payment in lieu of notice. Also, you may have a strong case if you believe your termination was motivated by discrimination.", "normalised": "Now, regarding termination.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of working hours. The Factories Act, 1948, and various state-specific Shops and Establishments Acts lay down the rules for this. Generally, an 8-hour workday is the norm, with overtime pay for anything beyond that. BUT, and this is a big but, this isn't always enforced, especially in the IT sector. Make sure you track your hours! If you’re consistently working 12+ hours a day without proper compensation, that’s a red flag. The Labour Commissioner's office in your city is the place to lodge a complaint.", "normalised": "Then there's the issue of working hours.
