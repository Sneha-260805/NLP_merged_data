Seemed alright at first, pretty keen, you know? But after about 2 weeks, things started getting sus. She was clocking in like 14 hrs/day, even on weekends! I’m like, “Priya, chill, it's not worth the burn out.\" Boss was happy cos work getting done cheap, but nobody addressing whether this even legal under Labour Laws.", "normalised": "Okay, so I have got to share this weird situation at my office.

{"unnormalised": "So, few days back, Priya actually collapsed at her desk at 11 PM! Apparently, she's been working so much to support her family and repay education loan (Rs. 5 lakhs!), and she's scared of getting fired. We called an ambulance, thankfully she's okay, but this got me thinking seriously. Is my boss exploiting her? Is this even legal? I remember seeing something about a \"Minimum Wages Act\" when studying for my exams, but I am not sure. The firm probably not giving her PF or anything!", "normalised": "So, a few days back, Priya actually collapsed at her desk at eleven P-M!
