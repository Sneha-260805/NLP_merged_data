{"unnormalised": "Hey folks, quick question about labour law in India. My company, a startup in Bangalore, is trying to figure out the whole employee leave policy thing. We're aiming for something chill but compliant. I’ve been reading up on the various acts, but honestly, it’s a bit of a head-spinner. Anyone have experience with the Shops and Establishments Act, esp. Karnataka’s version? Trying to understand how many CLs (casual leaves) and PLs (privilege leaves) are legally required for employees after, say, 1 year of service?", "normalised": "Hey folks, quick question about labor law in India.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about notice period norms? The standard seems to be 30 days (1 month), but can we stipulate a longer notice period, say, 2 months for senior roles? And if someone's caught violating company policy, like showing up late consistently or not meeting deadlines, what are the grounds for termination under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947? Is just giving a verbal warning enough, or do we need to document everything meticulously? Legal jargon is confusing AF, help a bro out!", "normalised": "Also, what about notice period norms?

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, what are the rules regarding overtime pay? If someone works extra hours during a project crunch – let's say, clocked in 10 hrs extra in 1 week – how much extra should they be paid under the law? Is it 1.5x or 2x their regular rate? Any pointers or resources would be super helpful! Thanks in advance, my dudes.", "normalised": "Lastly, what are the rules regarding overtime pay?
