{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice regarding labour law stuff. My friend, Raju, works at a small factory in Faridabad. He says his boss isn't giving him proper overtime pay. He regularly works 10-12 hrs a day, but only gets paid regular wages for the extra hours. Isn't that illegal? I thought the min wage act and the factories act covered this?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice regarding labor law stuff. My friend, Raju, works at a small factory in Faridabad.

{"unnormalised": "He's scared to complain directly to the boss coz he thinks he'll get fired. The factory has like, only 20-25 employees so not sure if all the labour laws even apply to them. Plus, he doesn't have any proof – no payslips or anything. Everything is done \"under the table,\" apparently. Any advocates or anyone who knows about this stuff, please help!", "normalised": "He is scared to complain directly to the boss because he thinks he will get fired.
