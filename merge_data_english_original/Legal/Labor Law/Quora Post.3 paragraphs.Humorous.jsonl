Your company deducts 12% from your basic salary + DA, and they put in an equal amount (mostly). This money sits in your EPF account and earns interest. Think of it as your future chai-biscuit fund for when you're old and can't climb stairs anymore.", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about the Employee Provident Fund (E-P-F).
