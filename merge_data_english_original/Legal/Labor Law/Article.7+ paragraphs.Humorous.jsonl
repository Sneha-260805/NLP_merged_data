{"unnormalised": "So, you think labor law is boring? Think again! It’s a veritable rollercoaster of rules and regulations designed to, well, keep things fair…ish. But let's be honest, trying to navigate the labyrinth of Acts and Amendments can feel like trying to herd cats after they’ve had way too much chai. In India, we have a whole smorgasbord of them, from the Factories Act, 1948 to the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. Yes, the 1940s! Some of these laws are older than your granddad's dhoti!", "normalised": "So, you think labor law is boring? Think again!

{"unnormalised": "Let's take the case of Sharma Industries vs. the Universe (okay, maybe just a disgruntled employee named Raju). Raju, a chap who insisted on taking 2-hour lunch breaks (12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, mind you), claimed unfair dismissal. Sharma Industries, on the other hand, argued that Raju’s “extended meditation sessions” were costing them a fortune. The court, after much deliberation (and probably several cups of tea), had to interpret the fine print of the \"hours of work\" clause. What’s a reasonable break? What constitutes “work”? These are the questions that keep labor lawyers up at night, folks.", "normalised": "Let's take the case of Sharma Industries versus the Universe (okay, maybe just a disgruntled employee named Raju).

{"unnormalised": "So, is labor law a headache? Maybe. Is it necessary? Absolutely. It’s the slightly wonky, often confusing, but ultimately crucial framework that keeps the employer-employee relationship from turning into a full-blown Bollywood brawl. So next time you hear someone grumbling about labor law, just smile, hand them a cup of chai, and remind them that it’s all there to keep things (relatively) fair. And maybe, just maybe, hire a good lawyer. You'll thank me later. Maybe Adv. Patel can help, he is charging Rs. 5000 per hr these days.", "normalised": "So, is labor law a headache? Maybe.
