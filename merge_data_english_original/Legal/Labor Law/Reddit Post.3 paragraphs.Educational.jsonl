{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about labor law here in India. I'm a small business owner in Bangalore, and I'm a bit confused about calculating PF contributions. The rule says 12% of the basic wage plus DA, right? But what exactly counts as \"basic wage\"? My accountant says it only includes the base salary, but my friend who runs a similar company in Chennai says it includes some allowances too. Anyone have experience with this?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about labor law here in India.

{"unnormalised": "I was reading up on the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and it got me thinking. What happens if I, say, accidentally pay an employee less than the minimum wage? What are the penalties under the Act? Also, how frequently are minimum wages revised? Is there a single minimum wage for the entire country or does it vary by state? Anyone know where I can find the updated list of state-wise minimum wages as of today's date 15/11/2024?", "normalised": "I was reading up on the Minimum Wages Act, one thousand nine hundred and forty eight and it got me thinking.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, regarding employee termination – I read about Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It seems pretty strict about retrenchment compensation and notice periods. If an employee has worked for, say, 240 days in the last 12 months, is that enough to trigger these provisions? And what happens if I fail to comply with the requirements of Section 25F? Just trying to ensure I'm following all the rules properly!
