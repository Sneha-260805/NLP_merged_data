{"unnormalised": "The foundational element is often the house number or flat number, frequently combined with the building or apartment name. \"H. No. 123\" refers to house number 123, while \"Flat 4B\" indicates the 4th flat in building B. The building name (\"Sai Apartment\" in our example) is crucial, particularly in densely populated urban areas. It distinguishes the specific dwelling within a larger complex or street. The street name or road name, like \"10 MG Road,\" follows, providing the location of the building itself.

{"unnormalised": "Following the street name, the area or locality is specified. This could be a neighborhood, a sector, or a prominent landmark that helps narrow down the location within the city. For example, \"Indiranagar\" or \"Sector 15\" would be typical area names. The state (\"Karnataka\" in our example) is essential for postal sorting, especially for inter-state deliveries. Different states may have similar area or street names.", "normalised": "Following the street name, the area or locality is specified.

Ensuring the correct PIN code is vital for accurate and timely delivery. For example, sending a letter to \"12, Park Street, Kolkata, 700016\" without the '700016' risks misdirection. It's always wise to double-check the PIN code, especially when filling out online forms or making important deliveries.", "normalised": "Finally, the postal index number (P-I-N code), a six-digit number, is a critical component. The P-I-N code, like \"five hundred and sixty thousand and one,\" designates the specific post office serving the address. Ensuring the correct P-I-N code is vital for accurate and timely delivery. For example, sending a letter to \"twelve, Park Street, Kolkata, seven hundred thousand and sixteen\" without the 'seven hundred thousand and sixteen' risks misdirection. It's always wise to double-check the P-I-N code, especially when filling out online forms or making important deliveries."}
