{"unnormalised": "The thing is, Indian addresses are often a mix of official and unofficial landmarks. You might have a house number and street name, but then also \"opp. SBI Bank\" or \"next to the water tank\". And let's not forget the abbreviations! \"H. No.\" this, \"St.\" that, \"Rd.\" something else. It's like a secret code. My aunt's address is \"Plot No. 4, Gali No. 6, Prem Nagar, Delhi-110058\".
