{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, navigating the Mumbai address system is like trying to find a rational explanation for why auto-rickshaws think they own the road. It’s chaotic, a little bit mad, and ultimately, you end up somewhere…eventually. Take for instance, the time I was supposed to meet my friend at \"Bldg No. 7, Opp. XYZ Store, Near the Big Banyan Tree, Andheri (W), 400053.\" Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. Turns out, there are approximately 7,842 \"XYZ Stores\" and approximately 4,231 \"Big Banyan Trees\" in Andheri (W). I ended up having chai with a very confused watchman outside \"Bldg No. 7\" (or was it 8?) for a good 45 mins before realizing I was in the wrong suburb altogether!", "normalised": "Let's be honest, navigating the Mumbai address system is like trying to find a rational explanation for why auto-rickshaws think they own the road.

I once tried ordering a pizza to \"A-204, Happy Homes Society, Linking Road, Bandra (W), maybe 400050 or 400052, or possibly even 400053, I'm not entirely sure.\" The delivery guy called me back, sounding utterly defeated, and said, \"Madam, just tell me a landmark! Is it near the Salman Khan's house or the other famous person's house?\" In the end, he found me because he recognized my neighbour's dog.

{"unnormalised": "The apartment names themselves are a source of endless amusement. We've got everything from \"Shanti Niketan\" (which, ironically, is located right next to a construction site) to \"Paradise Apartments\" (overlooking a garbage dump). I saw one recently called \"Sky High Residences\" which was a 3-story building! The audacity! And don’t even get me started on trying to decipher the abbreviations: \"Fl No. 2B, Gnd Flr, Bldg A, Sec III, JVPD Scheme, Vile Parle (W), Mumbai – 400049.\" It’s like reading ancient Sanskrit…unless you’re a seasoned Mumbaikar, in which case, you probably still get lost.", "normalised": "The apartment names themselves are a source of endless amusement.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of floors, the ground floor/first floor debate is a never-ending saga. Is it \"Grd Flr\" or \"1st Flr\"? Does \"2nd Flr\" mean the second floor up from the ground, or the third? It's a real philosophical question that keeps me up at night. I once visited someone who lived on the “4th Flr,” and I ended up climbing what felt like 40 flights of stairs because the lift was \"under maintenance\" since 2012. Turns out, it was actually the 7th floor! My calves still haven't forgiven me.", "normalised": "Speaking of floors, the ground floor slash first floor debate is a never-ending saga.

You’ll need it. And if all else fails, just ask the nearest aunty – she’ll know exactly where “Sharmaji’s son’s friend’s cousin” lives, even if you don’t.
