{"unnormalised": "Well, knowing how addresses are written in Bangalore will definitely help you out! You'll often see addresses like \"#123, 4th Cross, 2nd Main, HSR Layout, Bangalore-560102, Karnataka\". This is a pretty standard format. The '#' symbol usually indicates the house or apartment number. \"4th Cross\" refers to the street name, and \"2nd Main\" specifies the main road within that locality. HSR Layout is the specific area or neighborhood. \"Bangalore-560102\" includes the city and the pin code, which is super important for accurate mail delivery.
