By \"charming,\" I mean it looked like it hadn’t seen a fresh coat of paint since the year 1947 (India's independence, for the uninitiated).

{"unnormalised": "Then there was the place I thought I’d hit the jackpot on! The ad said: \"Apt 202, Galaxy Apartments, Above D Mart, Powai, 400076\". Galaxy Apartments! Sounds fancy, right? It was above D Mart, which meant late-night snack runs were within reach. Perfection! Except, \"above\" D Mart turned out to mean “balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff overlooking D Mart, accessible only by a rickety staircase that looked like it was held together by hope and prayers.” My mother would have a heart attack.", "normalised": "Then there was the place I thought I’d hit the jackpot on!

Picture this: a swirling vortex of rickshaws, street vendors, cows, and approximately 2 million people all vying for space. Gali No. 4 was a labyrinth of narrow lanes, each smelling distinctly different (and not in a good way). I’m pretty sure I aged 10 years just trying to find the door. The apartment?
