{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the most basic format usually starts with the house number and building name, like \"H.No. 123, Green View Apartments\". If there’s no specific building name, you might just have something like \"123, Main Street\" or \"House No. 45, Sector 17\". Then comes the street name, area, or landmark. This helps pinpoint the location a bit better. Think something like \"near City Hospital, MG Road.\"", "normalised": "Firstly, the most basic format usually starts with the house number and building name, like \"H.N.O. one hundred and twenty three, Green View Apartments\".

{"unnormalised": "Next, you'll typically include the city and the state. For instance, \"Mumbai, Maharashtra\". It's super important to include the state as India has a LOT of cities with the same name! And the final piece of the puzzle is the PIN code. It's a 6-digit number, like \"400001\", and it helps the postal service sort mail super efficiently. Always double-check this, a wrong PIN can cause major delays.

{"unnormalised": "For apartment complexes, remember to include the flat number! Otherwise, the delivery guy will be wandering around asking everyone!

Some examples of fully written addresses are \"Aisha Khan, Flat 201, Gulmohar Apartments, Linking Road, Bandra West, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400050\" or \"Ramesh Kumar, H. No. 5, Village Rampur, P.O.
