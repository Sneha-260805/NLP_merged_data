{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some help with figuring out if I've got my address right for this online order. Moving to a new place can be such a pain, especially when trying to update everything! My new address is: Flat No. 102, Sai Residency, Near D-Mart, Sector-12, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai - 410210. Does that look alright? I'm always paranoid I'm going to mess something up and my chai masala will end up in Timbuktu, lol.", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some help with figuring out if I've got my address right for this online order.

{"unnormalised": "I'm mainly worried about the \"Near D-Mart\" part. Should I just leave that out? It's a pretty well-known landmark around here, and tbh, it's easier to explain to the delivery guy. Plus, most auto-rickshaw drivers know it, ya know? I've heard some stories where people's deliveries got delayed because of incorrect landmark information. Don't want that happening to my precious books I ordered!", "normalised": "I'm mainly worried about the \"Near D-Mart\" part. Should I just leave that out?
