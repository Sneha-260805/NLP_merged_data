{"unnormalised": "In India, residential addresses typically follow a hierarchical structure, moving from the most specific information to the least specific. This generally starts with the house number and building name, followed by the street or locality, then the city, district (if applicable), state, and finally the postal code (PIN code). While there isn't a single \"correct\" format, this structure is widely accepted and used for postal services and official documentation. For example, you might see something like \"Flat No. 101, Krishna Apartments, Linking Road, Bandra West, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400050.\" Note the use of abbreviations like \"No.\" for \"Number\" and \"Rd.\" for \"Road\" are commonly used, especially in informal contexts.", "normalised": "In India, residential addresses typically follow a hierarchical structure, moving from the most specific information to the least specific.

This six-digit code identifies a specific post office within a region. Also, clarity is key. While abbreviations are acceptable, ensure that they are commonly understood. If you live in a rural area, including the village name after the house number is a good practice. For example: \"House No. 56, Village Rampur, Post Office Chandpur, District Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, 246761\".
