For example, you might see \"House No. 123\" or \"Shanti Niwas\". This is followed by the street name or locality. Common terms include \"MG Road\", \"Linking Road\", or simply a local area name like \"Indira Nagar\". Sometimes, if the house is part of a larger building or complex, the apartment number or floor is included, like \"Flat 2B\" or \"2nd Floor\".", "normalised": "At its core, a typical Indian residential address starts with the most specific information: the house number or name.

{"unnormalised": "Following the city, the postal code, also known as the PIN code (Postal Index Number), is absolutely essential. This 6-digit number is a unique identifier for a specific post office delivery area, ensuring accurate sorting and delivery. For instance, \"110001\" is the PIN code for New Delhi General Post Office, while \"400001\" represents Mumbai GPO. Using the correct PIN code is vital for ensuring your mail reaches its intended destination without delays.", "normalised": "Following the city, the postal code, also known as the P-I-N code (Postal Index Number), is absolutely essential. This six-digit number is a unique identifier for a specific post office delivery area, ensuring accurate sorting and delivery. For instance, \"one hundred and ten thousand and one\" is the P-I-N code for New Delhi General Post Office, while \"four hundred thousand and one\" represents Mumbai G-P-O. Using the correct P-I-N code is vital for ensuring your mail reaches its intended destination without delays."}
