{"unnormalised": "First off, decide where you want to live. Mumbai is HUGE. Do you want to be near your office? Near the sea? Or in a quieter suburb? Areas like Bandra (W) and Juhu are fancy, but expensive. Places like Andheri (E) and Borivali are more affordable, but the commute might be a pain. Think about that 1st!
