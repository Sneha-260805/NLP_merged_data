{"unnormalised": "Current residential addresses in India exhibit significant variability. One may encounter addresses like \"H.No. 123, Ganesh Nagar, Near SBI Bank, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500001\" or \"Flat No. A-402, Shanti Apartments, Opp. CCD, Juhu, Mumbai - 400049.\" The lack of a standardized order for components, the presence of local landmarks, and inconsistent use of abbreviations contribute to ambiguities. For instance, \"Sector-62, Noida, U.P., 201301\" might be interpreted differently by various systems due to the varied formatting and abbreviations like \"U.P.\" for Uttar Pradesh.", "normalised": "Current residential addresses in India exhibit significant variability.

{"unnormalised": "The challenges arising from this lack of standardization are manifold. Postal delivery services face increased inefficiencies, leading to delays and misdeliveries. Emergency services may struggle to locate residences quickly, potentially impacting response times. E-commerce companies also encounter difficulties in verifying addresses, resulting in higher logistics costs and customer dissatisfaction. Moreover, data analytics and demographic studies become challenging when address data is inconsistent and unreliable.", "normalised": "The challenges arising from this lack of standardization are manifold.

{"unnormalised": "To address these challenges, several measures can be implemented. Firstly, a nationwide standard address format should be established, specifying the order and format of address components. For example, a possible standardized format could be: [Flat/House Number], [Building/Apartment Name], [Street/Locality Name], [Landmark], [City/Town], [State], [PIN Code]. Secondly, the use of a consistent address format across government databases and private sector applications should be encouraged. The government's Digital India initiative can play a crucial role in promoting such adoption.", "normalised": "To address these challenges, several measures can be implemented.

Geocoding services can translate addresses into geographic coordinates, facilitating accurate location identification. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to automatically parse and standardize addresses from diverse sources. A concerted effort from government agencies, private companies, and citizens is essential to achieve effective address normalization and unlock its associated benefits across various sectors.", "normalised": "Furthermore, technology can be leveraged to improve address normalization.
