{"unnormalised": "Another thing I’ve learned is that calling ahead is your best friend. Confirm your booking and, more importantly, ask for detailed directions. Don't be shy about asking for landmarks. Sometimes, a hotel will be known more for its proximity to a famous tea stall or a particular landmark than its actual street number.
