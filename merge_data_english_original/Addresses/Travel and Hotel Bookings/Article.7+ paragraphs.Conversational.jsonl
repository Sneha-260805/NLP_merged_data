{"unnormalised": "First off, let's tackle the basics. You'll often find \"House No.\" or \"Plot No.\" followed by a number. This is the individual building's identifier.

{"unnormalised": "Hotel addresses can be especially tricky. They often include landmarks to help you find them.

{"unnormalised": "Pro-tip: When booking online, double-check the address on Google Maps or a similar service. Sometimes the address listed on the hotel website isn't perfectly accurate, and a quick map check can save you a lot of headaches later.

I have had hotels, especially smaller ones, mess up the address on their websites, and only a call helped ensure that I was going to the right location.", "normalised": "Pro-tip: When booking online, double-check the address on Google Maps or a similar service.
