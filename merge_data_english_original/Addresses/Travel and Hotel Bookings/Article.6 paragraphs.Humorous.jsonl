The “near” in Indian addresses is a relative term, like saying Pluto is “near” the Earth. After driving in circles for what felt like 3 hours (probably closer to 45 minutes, but who’s counting when you're battling auto-rickshaws?), I finally found it tucked away behind a bustling market selling everything from bangles to live chickens. Turns out, “near” meant “within a 5km radius, good luck finding it.”", "normalised": "Take, for example, my quest to find “Hotel Maharaja Palace, Near Railway Station, Jaipur, Rajasthan three hundred and two thousand and six”.
