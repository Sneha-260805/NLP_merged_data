{"unnormalised": "I'm looking at these Airbnb listings, right? One is just listed as \"Near Fort Kochi Beach,\" which is helpful, I guess, if I plan to sleep on the sand. The other is \"Building No. 12/456A, XYZ Road,\" but XYZ Road appears to exist only in the mind of the property owner. Google Maps just laughs at me. Then there's the hotel promising \"Opposite Lulu Mall,\" which is great, except Lulu Mall is approximately the size of a small country. Gonna spend half my vacation wandering around looking for it. Also, does \"opposite\" mean directly across or like, a 2 km auto-rickshaw ride away? These are important questions!", "normalised": "I am looking at these Airbnb listings, right?
