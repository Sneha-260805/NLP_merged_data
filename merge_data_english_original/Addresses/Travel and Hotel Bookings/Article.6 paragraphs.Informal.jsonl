{"unnormalised": "First things first, pay attention to the street number. For example, \"House No. 123\" might seem simple, but in India, street numbering can be...creative. Sometimes numbers skip or repeat. Then there's the \"Near XYZ landmark\" which can be subjective. What's \"near\" to the hotel might be a 20-minute auto-rickshaw ride in reality. Look out for localities like \"Calangute,\" \"Baga,\" and \"Anjuna.\" These are popular, but huge.
