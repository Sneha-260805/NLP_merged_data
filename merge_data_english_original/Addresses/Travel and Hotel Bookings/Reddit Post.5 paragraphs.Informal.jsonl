{"unnormalised": "So, me and my family are planning a trip to Jaipur around Diwali, specifically from 25/10/2024 to 29/10/2024. Been looking at hotels and am totally overwhelmed by the options. Budget is roughly Rs. 5000-Rs. 7000 per night. Want something centrally located, preferably near MI Road, like around 22 Godam Circle. Good connectivity is key, since we'll be relying on autos and maybe Ola/Uber.", "normalised": "So, me and my family are planning a trip to Jaipur around Diwali, specifically from twenty fifth October two thousand and twenty four to twenty ninth October two thousand and twenty four.
