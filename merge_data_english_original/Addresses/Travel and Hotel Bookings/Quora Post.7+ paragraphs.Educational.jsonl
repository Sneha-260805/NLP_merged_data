{"unnormalised": "**Question:** What are some common address-related issues people face while booking travel and hotels in India?", "normalised": "Firstly, the sheer variety of address formats is bewildering. Some sites want \"House Number or Building Name,\" others insist on \"Street Address,\" and then there are those that require \"Locality or Area.\" Figuring out where \"Gulmohar Apartments\" fits in when the form only has \"House Number\" is a common challenge. Also, many older establishments in places like Kolkata still use legacy addressing systems; for example, you might see \"twelve divided by three B, Lake Road, Kolkata dash seven zero zero zero two nine,\" which is perfectly valid but might confuse an auto-complete function."}

Make sure the pin code is correct! \"four zero zero zero zero one\" is very different from \"four zero zero zero seven two,\" even though both are in Mumbai. A typo can mean your confirmation mail goes to the wrong area entirely. I remember a friend booked a hotel near Marine Drive (four zero zero zero two zero), but accidentally entered four zero zero zero zero two; needless to say, he ended up in a very different part of the city!"}

Many smaller hotels or guesthouses rely on landmarks instead of formal addresses. \"Opposite the State Bank of India, M G Road, Bangalore dash five six zero zero zero one\" might be the only address available.

Some booking engines will not recognize \"M H\" for Maharashtra; they need the full state name. It seems simple, but it is a common tripping point. Similarly, \"T N\" instead of \"Tamil Nadu\" can cause issues. Input standardization varies wildly."}

If you are booking a homestay in a smaller village, the address might be something like \"Near Panchayat Office, Village: Rampur, Post: Bahadurganj, Dist: Azamgarh, U P dash two seven six zero zero one.\" It is crucial to include all these details. Abbreviating anything (like \"P O\" for Post Office) could lead to delivery problems. Also, sometimes the hotel may be registered under one village and the booking portal thinks its in a different village or tehsil. This can lead to addresses that are actually miles apart!"}
