{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's the Quora post based on your specifications, focusing on addresses related to travel and hotel bookings in India, with a narrative tone, Indian English, and including various unnormalized address formats:", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about planning a trip to India, specifically about the challenges of booking hotels and figuring out addresses. It reminded me of my own initial struggles when I first started travelling extensively within the country. Thought I’d share some hard-earned wisdom!"}

I’d booked a hotel near M-G Road, specifically noting down \"hash thirty two, Barton Centre, M-G Road, Bangalore, Karnataka, five hundred sixty thousand and one\" as the address. Easy enough, right? Wrong! The auto-rickshaw driver took me to the *wrong* Barton Centre. Turns out, Bangalore has more than one… who knew? After about an hour of frantic phone calls and escalating frustration (and a lot of extra rupees spent on the auto), I finally managed to find the right place. Apparently, I should have also mentioned it was *opposite* the Metro station or the \"next to Citibank A-T-M\" detail I found later on Google. Lesson learned: always confirm landmarks!"}

The hotel confirmation email stated, \"Hotel Raj Mahal, C dash two, M-I Road, Jaipur, Rajasthan, three hundred two thousand and one.\" Sounds precise, but M-I Road is long!

Don't blindly trust the addresses listed on travel websites. Verify them. Call the hotel directly. Confirm the landmarks. Ask for directions in *local* terms. A G-P-S might not understand “opposite Corporation Bank,” but a local will. Also, learn some basic Hindi or the local language. Knowing \"paas mein\" (nearby) and \"seedha jao\" (go straight) can be lifesavers."}

Indian hospitality is amazing; people are generally very willing to guide you, even if it means going out of their way. Just remember to double and triple check those addresses! And if all else fails, look for the nearest chai stall, and ask for directions. A good cup of chai and local knowledge can solve most travel problems in India. Just don’t expect the address to be normalized!"}
