{"unnormalised": "First things first, addresses in India are generally written in a hierarchical order. Think small to big. You'll usually see the house number or building name first, followed by the street or locality. For example, you might see something like \"House No. 123, Krishna Nagar\". Then comes the area or sub-locality. This could be \"Sector 15\" in a planned city like Noida, or maybe \"Bandra West\" in Mumbai. The city then follows, like \"Delhi\", \"Mumbai\", or \"Chennai\".", "normalised": "First things first, addresses in India are generally written in a hierarchical order. Think small to big.

Here, \"The Oberoi\" is the hotel name, \"443 Udyog Vihar Phase V\" is the location details, \"Gurgaon\" is the city, \"Haryana\" is the state and \"122016\" is the all important postal code. Don't forget the state – it helps narrow things down!
