{"unnormalised": "Anyone have recommendations for decent places near Hawa Mahal or City Palace? Ideally, I'd like something in the price range of Rs. 3000-5000 per night. Don't need anything super fancy, just clean, safe, and maybe with a good view. Bonus points if it's within walking distance of some good street food stalls! I'm okay if the precise address is not immediately near these sites - I can easily take an auto or cab after all.", "normalised": "Anyone have recommendations for decent places near Hawa Mahal or City Palace?

{"unnormalised": "Also, is it better to book through a website like Booking.com, or directly with the hotel? I've heard mixed things about both. Some people say you get better deals booking directly, but others say the websites offer more protection. Any insights? I will be arriving by train at Jaipur Junction, so maybe locations around there are also helpful.", "normalised": "Also, is it better to book through a website like Booking dot com, or directly with the hotel?

{"unnormalised": "I was looking at \"The Raj Palace, Amer Road, Jaipur, Rajasthan 302002, India\" online but honestly, it looks a bit out of my budget LOL. Are there alternatives that offer a similar regal vibe but without the crazy price tag? Even if the alternative is 15 km from Jaipur Jn. I don't mind! I also saw \"Rambagh Palace Hotel, Bhawani Singh Rd, Rambagh, Jaipur, Rajasthan 302005, India,\" but that’s probably even more expensive!", "normalised": "I was looking at \"The Raj Palace, Amer Road, Jaipur, Rajasthan three zero two zero zero two, India\" online but honestly, it looks a bit out of my budget L-O-L.
