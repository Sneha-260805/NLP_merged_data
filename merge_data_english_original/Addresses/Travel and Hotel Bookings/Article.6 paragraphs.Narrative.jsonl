My own recent adventure started with booking a charming little guesthouse in Udaipur. The initial booking confirmation just stated \"Near City Palace, Udaipur,\" which wasn't exactly helpful when the auto-rickshaw driver asked for a specific address at 6 AM.

The bus ticket simply mentioned “Udaipur Central Bus Stand” but neglected to specify which entrance. There are actually 3!

A detailed address – including the house number, street name, city, state, and postal code (like 560001 for Bangalore or 400001 for Mumbai) – can save you a lot of time and frustration.
