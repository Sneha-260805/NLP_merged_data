{"unnormalised": "One of the key issues lies in the variations and inconsistencies in address formats across India. A typical address might include a flat number, building name, street name, locality, city, state, and postal code, all potentially presented in different orders. For example, an address might be entered as \"H.No. 123, 4th Cross, Malleswaram, Bangalore - 560003, Karnataka\" or simply as \"Malleswaram, Bangalore, 560003\". These discrepancies can lead to errors in delivery, navigation, and emergency services. Standardizing address input fields and providing clear instructions can significantly mitigate these issues. Consider using dropdown menus for states and postal codes to minimize typographical errors.", "normalised": "One of the key issues lies in the variations and inconsistencies in address formats across India.

{"unnormalised": "Another challenge is the prevalence of abbreviations and local terminology. \"Rd\" for Road, \"St\" for Street, and \"Colony\" are frequently used, but not always consistently. Similarly, landmark-based addresses, such as \"Near SBI Bank, MG Road,\" are common but lack precision. Integrating an address autocomplete feature that suggests valid addresses as the user types can address this. This feature should ideally be powered by a comprehensive and frequently updated database that includes both formal and informal address variations.", "normalised": "Another challenge is the prevalence of abbreviations and local terminology. \"Road\" for Road, \"Street\" for Street, and \"Colony\" are frequently used, but not always consistently.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the integration of geo-location services can greatly enhance address accuracy. By allowing users to pinpoint their location on a map, the system can automatically populate the address fields, reducing the need for manual entry. This is particularly useful in rural areas or locations with less standardized addressing systems. Additionally, it is essential to validate the entered address against a reliable database to ensure that it is a valid and deliverable address. An immediate error message if the address is not found or if the postal code is invalid can prevent future complications.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the integration of geo-location services can greatly enhance address accuracy.
