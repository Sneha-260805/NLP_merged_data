{"unnormalised": "First, let's break down the components of a typical Indian address. You'll often see elements like the house number, building name, street name, area/locality, city, state, and the all-important postal index number, or PIN code. For example, you might see something like \"Flat No. 201, Sai Residency, 10th Cross Street, Jayanagar 3rd Block, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560011.\" This level of detail is vital. Don't shorten anything. Spell it all out for accuracy.", "normalised": "First, let us break down the components of a typical Indian address.

{"unnormalised": "When booking hotels online, pay close attention to the address fields. Many booking platforms have separate boxes for each address component. It's tempting to rush, but taking a moment to carefully input each detail is worth the effort. A common mistake is combining elements in one field, for example, putting \"Sai Residency, 10th Cross\" into a single \"Street Address\" box. Avoid that. Use the fields as intended.", "normalised": "When booking hotels online, pay close attention to the address fields. Many booking platforms have separate boxes for each address component.

{"unnormalised": "The PIN code, a 6-digit number, is particularly important in India. It helps postal services efficiently sort and deliver mail. Make sure you have the correct PIN code for your destination. For instance, \"Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400001\" is a standard address, where the PIN 400001 directs the mail to the correct zone. A wrong PIN can lead to delays or misdelivery.", "normalised": "The P-I-N code, a six digit number, is particularly important in India. It helps postal services efficiently sort and deliver mail. Make sure you have the correct P-I-N code for your destination.

A wrong P-I-N can lead to delays or misdelivery."}

Some systems might default to the traveler’s home country unless explicitly specified.
