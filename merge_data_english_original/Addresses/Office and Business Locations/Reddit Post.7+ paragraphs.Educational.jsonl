So, here is a quick breakdown to help you navigate the maze of Indian addresses."}
{"unnormalised": "Firstly, forget the super structured, left-to-right, top-to-bottom logic you might be used to. Indian addresses can be a delightful mix of specificity and… well, let's call it \"contextual information.\" You'll often see the most specific detail, like the shop number or building name, first. Think of it as starting with the most granular piece of information and then expanding outwards.", "normalised": "Firstly, forget the super structured, left to right, top to bottom logic you might be used to.

{"unnormalised": "Now, onto the elements themselves. You’ll almost always see a building number or name. It could be something like \"Shop No. 27\" or \"ABC Towers.\" This is usually the first thing you encounter. Then comes the street name or locality. This could be something straightforward like \"MG Road\" or more descriptive like \"Near the Post Office.\" Don't be surprised if there are multiple \"MG Roads\" in a city, so pay attention to the other details.", "normalised": "Now, onto the elements themselves.

{"unnormalised": "After the street, you'll typically find the area or neighborhood, like \"Koramangala\" in Bangalore or \"Connaught Place\" in Delhi. This is crucial for narrowing down the location. Next up is the city itself. This is usually pretty straightforward, but make sure you spell it correctly! Remember, it's \"Mumbai,\" not \"Bombay\" (though some people still use the old name). \"Chennai\", not Madras, etc.", "normalised": "After the street, you will typically find the area or neighborhood, like \"Koramangala\" in Bangalore or \"Connaught Place\" in Delhi.

{"unnormalised": "The state comes next, and it's usually abbreviated. For example, \"MH\" for Maharashtra, \"KA\" for Karnataka, \"TN\" for Tamil Nadu. Getting the state wrong can send your parcel to the wrong side of the country! Finally, we have the PIN code, also known as the postal index number. This is a 6-digit number that's essential for efficient mail delivery. Don't underestimate the power of the PIN code.

{"unnormalised": "One more thing to keep in mind: abbreviations are rampant! \"St.\" might stand for \"Street,\" \"Rd.\" for \"Road,\" \"Ln.\" for \"Lane,\" \"Colony\" will be \"Col\", \"Complex\" will be \"Cmplx\". Don't let them throw you off. Just use your context clues and a little bit of common sense. And if you are still unsure, ask a local. People are generally happy to help, especially if you're polite and ask for clarification.
