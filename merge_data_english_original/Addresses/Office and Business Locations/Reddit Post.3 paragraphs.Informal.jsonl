{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit fam, anyone else completely lost when trying to find a specific office in Gurgaon? I swear, navigating Cyber Hub or Udyog Vihar feels like a side quest in a video game.

And don't even get me started on the building numbers! \"Plot No. 12A, Tower B, 5th Floor\"... Good luck finding that without asking 5 different chai wallahs!", "normalised": "Hey Reddit fam, anyone else completely lost when trying to find a specific office in Gurgaon?
