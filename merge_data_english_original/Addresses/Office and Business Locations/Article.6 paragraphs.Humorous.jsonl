{"unnormalised": "The problem, you see, isn't the existence of addresses. Oh no, they exist alright! Beautifully printed on visiting cards, boldly emblazoned on websites, whispered with a hint of pride by newly minted entrepreneurs. The issue lies in their… shall we say… fluidity. Like a river in monsoon season, an Indian office address can shift, morph, and occasionally vanish altogether, only to reappear weeks later in a slightly different dimension.", "normalised": "The problem, you see, isn't the existence of addresses.

Laxmi Market is less a place and more a state of mind, a swirling vortex of spices, sarees, and questionable electronics. Shop No. 4 could be any stall within a 50-meter radius, depending on the prevailing winds and the vendor's mood.", "normalised": "Take the case of \"Sharma and Sons, Importers and Exporters, Shop Number four, Laxmi Market, Chandni Chowk, Delhi, one hundred ten thousand six\".

Sounds legit, until you realize that HSR Layout is essentially a grid designed by a drunken mathematician. Navigating it is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a unicycle, with the added bonus of getting serenaded by honking auto-rickshaws. Asking locals often yields gems like, “Go straight, take a left at the big banyan tree, then ask again.” The big banyan tree is currently occupied by a family of monkeys plotting world domination.", "normalised": "Then there's the \"Global Tech Solutions, second Cross, third Main, H-S-R Layout, Bangalore, five hundred sixty thousand one hundred two\".

Embrace the chaos, ask lots of questions, and maybe pack a GPS tracker, a compass, and a healthy dose of humor. You’ll get there eventually… probably. Just be prepared for an adventure.
