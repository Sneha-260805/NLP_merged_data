{"unnormalised": "At the most granular level, an Indian office address will typically begin with the name of the building or office complex. For instance, \"Express Towers\" or \"DLF Cyber Hub\". This initial element helps to pinpoint the specific location within a larger area. Following the building name, the floor number or office number is crucial for locating the correct space within the building. Examples include \"Level 10\" or \"Office No. 205\". Some older buildings might use alternate naming conventions for floor or office numbers.", "normalised": "at the most granular level, an indian office address will typically begin with the name of the building or office complex. for instance, \"express towers\" or \"D-L-F cyber hub\". this initial element helps to pinpoint the specific location within a larger area. following the building name, the floor number or office number is crucial for locating the correct space within the building. examples include \"level ten\" or \"office number two hundred and five\". some older buildings might use alternate naming conventions for floor or office numbers."}
{"unnormalised": "Next comes the street name, road name, or locality. This identifies the immediate surrounding area where the building is situated. Common examples include \"Nariman Point\", \"MG Road\", or \"Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC)\". If the office is located within a specific commercial district, that detail is included here as well. Sometimes, especially in rural areas, a village name (e.g., “Near Panchayat Office, Village: Rampur”) might be used instead of a street name.", "normalised": "next comes the street name, road name, or locality. this identifies the immediate surrounding area where the building is situated. common examples include \"nariman point\", \"M-G road\", or \"bandra kurla complex (B-K-C)\". if the office is located within a specific commercial district, that detail is included here as well. sometimes, especially in rural areas, a village name (e.g., “near panchayat office, village: rampur”) might be used instead of a street name."}
{"unnormalised": "The subsequent component is the city or town where the office is located. This provides a broader geographical context for the address. Obvious examples include \"Mumbai\", \"Delhi\", \"Kolkata\", or \"Chennai\". It's important to spell the city name correctly to avoid any confusion. Many cities, especially those with a history of British influence, have undergone name changes; using the modern, official name is recommended (e.g., Mumbai instead of Bombay).", "normalised": "the subsequent component is the city or town where the office is located. this provides a broader geographical context for the address. obvious examples include \"mumbai\", \"delhi\", \"kolkata\", or \"chennai\". it's important to spell the city name correctly to avoid any confusion. many cities, especially those with a history of british influence, have undergone name changes; using the modern, official name is recommended (e.g., mumbai instead of bombay)."}
{"unnormalised": "The penultimate element of an Indian office address is the state or union territory. This further clarifies the location within the country.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the postal index number (PIN code) completes the address. This six-digit numerical code is essential for efficient sorting and delivery of mail by India Post. An example PIN code would be \"400021\" (Mumbai). It's crucial to ensure the PIN code is accurate and matches the corresponding city and state to avoid delivery errors. A variation can be seen where the PIN code is specified by a separate line, directly below the city name.", "normalised": "finally, and perhaps most importantly, the postal index number (P-I-N code) completes the address. this six-digit numerical code is essential for efficient sorting and delivery of mail by india post. an example P-I-N code would be \"four hundred thousand and twenty one\" (mumbai). it's crucial to ensure the P-I-N code is accurate and matches the corresponding city and state to avoid delivery errors. a variation can be seen where the P-I-N code is specified by a separate line, directly below the city name."}
