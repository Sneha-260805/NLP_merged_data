{"unnormalised": "I've heard good things about places around MG Rd, but I’m worried about the traffic and the cost. Someone mentioned Koramangala – is 80 Feet Road, Koramangala a good place to set up shop? Or is it better to look towards Electronic City? Google Maps shows that E-City is a bit far from where most of my team lives (near BTM Layout). Ideally, something with a good postal code, like 560001 or 560034, would be a plus for deliveries and stuff.", "normalised": "I have heard good things about places around M-G Road, but I am worried about the traffic and the cost.

Are those generally a good option for a small team of like, 5-6 people? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
