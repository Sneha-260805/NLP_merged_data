{"unnormalised": "Let's face it, understanding Indian office addresses is an Olympic sport. You'd think locating a secret government facility would be easier. It's a tangled mess of plot numbers, abbreviations, and landmarks that seem to exist only in the mind of the postman. Forget GPS; you need a seasoned chai wallah with insider knowledge and a map drawn on a crumpled napkin.", "normalised": "Let us face it, understanding Indian office addresses is an Olympic sport.

{"unnormalised": "The first hurdle: the ever-enigmatic plot number. \"Plot No. 47/B-1, Sector-15A, Near Hanuman Mandir\" sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. \"Near Hanuman Mandir\" could mean anything from across the street to \"you'll see it if you squint on a full moon while chanting mantras.\" And don't even get me started on the sub-plots. What happened to A? Did aliens abduct it? Did it secede and form its own republic? We may never know.", "normalised": "The first hurdle: the ever-enigmatic plot number. \"Plot Number forty seven slash B-one, Sector-fifteen A, Near Hanuman Mandir\" sounds simple enough, right?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the sector. \"Sector-15A\" implies a level of organization that rarely exists in reality. Picture a flock of sheep attempting to file their taxes – that's more like it. You'll find buildings numbered randomly, street names that change every 50 meters, and a general sense of geographical anarchy. Good luck finding building 72 after you passed building 71 because it apparently skips three numbers. The streets are numbered with a similar level of chaos.", "normalised": "Then there is the sector. \"Sector-fifteen A\" implies a level of organization that rarely exists in reality.

{"unnormalised": "The landmark game is another adventure altogether. Landmarks are, in theory, useful for helping to locate your desired destination, for example \"Opp. SBI Bank\", but the ground reality is that it is not. The SBI bank could be shut down, or recently shifted making the landmark useless. This also goes for any popular Chai tapri because in India, they sprout and die like mushrooms after monsoon. What about \"Behind XYZ Store\"? Hope the \"XYZ Store\" hasn't gone out of business and been replaced by \"ABC Mobile Repairs.\" If that store went out of business recently, hope the taxi driver is well aware of it.", "normalised": "The landmark game is another adventure altogether.

{"unnormalised": "Pincodes! Ah, the savior of any sane person attempting to locate your office, right? Pincodes can indeed direct you to the correct area, but don't expect them to pinpoint the exact office. Pincodes cover surprisingly large areas, meaning you could still be several kilometers away and relying on \"landmark-based\" exploration.", "normalised": "Pincodes!

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the office names themselves. \"Innovision Solutions Pvt. Ltd.\" Sounds very serious, doesn't it? Now try finding a sign with that name. Chances are it's hidden behind a massive banyan tree or obscured by a rogue billboard advertising the latest Bollywood blockbuster. Or it's simply a small, hand-painted sign that blends seamlessly into the chaotic backdrop.", "normalised": "And let us not forget the office names themselves. \"Innovision Solutions Private Limited.\" Sounds very serious, does not it?

Embrace the chaos, arm yourself with patience, and maybe, just maybe, you'll find your destination before your blood pressure reaches dangerous levels.
