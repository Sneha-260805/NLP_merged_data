{"unnormalised": "My first attempt was this \"premium\" co-working space in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). The address was something like Unit 1204, 12th Floor, One BKC, G Block, Bandra (East), Mumbai 400051. Sounded fancy, right? Turns out, \"premium\" means \"overpriced\" and \"co-working\" means \"sharing a table with a guy who chews loudly on his vada pav at 9 AM.\" Plus, getting there from Thane every day?

The ad said \"Spacious Office - Prime Location!\" Address: Office No. 2B, Peninsula Business Park, Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai 400013. It was spacious, alright. Spaciously dilapidated. The lift looked like it hadn't been serviced since 1998, and the \"prime location\" turned out to be next to a construction site. My ears were ringing for days just from the site visit. And the landlord quoted some insane number, like Rs. 85,000 per month! Bhai, for that much, I could rent a small flat in Juhu!", "normalised": "Then there was this place in Lower Parel.
