And it *was* close to Koramangala... if you enjoy a brisk thirty-minute walk during peak rush hour. And the \"building\" was more of a glorified shed with \"office space\" carved out of it. The receptionist, bless her soul, gave me water in a steel glass - peak Bangalore startup vibes. She also added, \"Sir, G-P-S sometimes shows wrong location, we are actually behind Jyoti Nivas College\". Helpful, very helpful."}
