{"unnormalised": "Seriously, some of these brokers are quoting insane prices! Saw one listing for a tiny 1BHK at 12, Carter Road for Rs. 90L! Plus, society maintenance is like Rs. 10,000/month minimum everywhere. Is it just me, or is Mumbai real estate completely out of control? I'm even considering areas further out, like Andheri (W), if it means a bigger space for the same budget. Pin codes in those areas would be 400058, 400053 – are they worth checking out?", "normalised": "Seriously, some of these brokers are quoting insane prices!
