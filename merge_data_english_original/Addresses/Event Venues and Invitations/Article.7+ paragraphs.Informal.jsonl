{"unnormalised": "First things first, those shortened addresses. You see something like “Venue: The Grand Ballroom, Opp. City Centre Mall, DLF Phase 3, Ggn, 122002.” Opp. means \"Opposite\". \"DLF\" is the name of the developer and \"Ggn\" is Gurgaon. It might sound obvious, but trust me, when you're rushing from one function to another, your brain turns to mush. Knowing \"Opp.\" isn’t some fancy ballroom term saves you from circling the block thrice. And that PIN code – 122002? That’s Gurgaon, Haryana.

{"unnormalised": "Next, the time. “Reception: 7:30 PM onwards.” What does \"onwards\" even mean? Well, in India, it means the party officially starts at 7:30 PM, but don’t show up precisely at 7:30 PM. Indian Standard Time (IST) applies, which translates to “fashionably late is perfectly acceptable.” Aim for 8:00 PM, maybe even 8:30 PM if you want to avoid awkward small talk before the buffet is open.", "normalised": "Next, the time. “Reception: seven thirty P-M onwards.” What does \"onwards\" even mean?

{"unnormalised": "Then there are the venue details themselves. Sometimes, invitations list the full address like \"The Taj Palace Hotel, Sardar Patel Marg, Diplomatic Enclave, New Delhi, 110021.\" That's pretty straightforward. But other times, they give you cryptic clues like \"Near the Metro Station\" or \"Behind the SBI Bank.\" In these cases, a quick Google search is your best friend. Just type in \"SBI Bank near wedding venue [venue name]\" and pray for the best.", "normalised": "Then there are the venue details themselves.

{"unnormalised": "Don’t forget the dress code!

Maybe still wear something slightly festive, just in case.", "normalised": "Don’t forget the dress code!
