The biggest hurdle, however, was finding the perfect wedding venue in Mumbai. Priya and her fiancé, Rohan, had a specific vision: a place that was both elegant and accessible, reflecting their modern yet traditional sensibilities. The venue would not only host the main ceremony, but also pre-wedding events such as the mehndi and sangeet.
