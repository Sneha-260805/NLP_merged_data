{"unnormalised": "Okay, so my cousin's wedding is coming up and the venue search has been...interesting, to say the least. We started with \"The Grand Ballroom, Sector 44, Noida, 201301\" which sounds fancy, right? Turns out, \"Grand\" refers to the size of the electricity bill, not the decor. Think mismatched chairs and a suspicious stain on the carpet. My aunt insisted it was “character-building.” I countered with wanting to build character elsewhere, like, maybe a spa in Bali?", "normalised": "Okay, so my cousin's wedding is coming up and the venue search has been...interesting, to say the least.
