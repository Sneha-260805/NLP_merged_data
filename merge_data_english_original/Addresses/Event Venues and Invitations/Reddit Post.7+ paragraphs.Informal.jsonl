Looking for something that's not too crazy expensive, but still looks decent and can handle a crowd. Food is super important, 'cause you know how aunties are - if the biryani isn't on point, you'll hear about it for years. Must have good vegetarian options too.", "normalised": "So, background: Aisha is getting married to Rahul (yay!). Guest list is kind of big, around four hundred to four hundred and fifty people.

A lot of our relatives are coming from out of town, so near the airport (Kempegowda International Airport, near Devanahalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560300) or a metro station would be a HUGE plus. Parking is also a must because Bangalore traffic is a nightmare. I don't want people spending 2 hrs just to reach!", "normalised": "Location-wise, somewhere relatively accessible would be great.
