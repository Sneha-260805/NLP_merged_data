Then there's Celebration Gardens, near Electronic City, Bangalore, 560100. It's an outdoor venue, which is great, but Bangalore weather in Nov is so unpredictable! Lastly, we saw Hotel Royal Inn on G.T. Road, Delhi, 110009. Seems decent, but it's kinda far from most of our relatives' places.", "normalised": "First, there's The Grand Ballroom at twelve, Park Street, Kolkata, seven hundred thousand and sixteen.

We're looking for something that can accommodate around 300 guests, good food is a MUST, and ideally, a place that won't completely break the bank. Budget is around Rs. 15 lakhs max.
