{"unnormalised": "Hey there! Someone asked about good venues for a wedding reception in Gurgaon, right? Well, it really depends on your budget and the number of guests. For a smaller, more intimate gathering (say, 100-150 people), places like The Oberoi Gurgaon (Udyog Vihar, Phase V) or Trident Gurgaon (443, Udyog Vihar Phase V) offer excellent banquet halls and service. They're a bit on the pricier side though, expect to shell out Rs. 5000+ per plate.", "normalised": "Hey there! Someone asked about good venues for a wedding reception in Gurgaon, right?

Also, consider farmhouses along Sohna Road. Many of them have amazing outdoor spaces, perfect for a grand reception. A good landmark there would be near GD Goenka World School, Sohna-Gurgaon Road. The rental cost varies drastically though, so do your homework.
