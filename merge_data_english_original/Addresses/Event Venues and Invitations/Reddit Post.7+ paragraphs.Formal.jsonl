{"unnormalised": "First, a little context. We’re expecting around 400-450 guests (give or take a few crazy relatives from Delhi!), so we need a space that can comfortably accommodate that. I'd love something with a bit of character, not just a standard banquet hall. Outdoor space would be a massive bonus, but I know that's asking a lot in Mumbai! Budget-wise, we’re looking at around ₹1500-₹2500 per plate. This needs to include both venue hire and catering (veg and non-veg options are essential). Basically the reception needs to be the kind of event, the guests will be talking about for years to come.. In a good way!", "normalised": "First, a little context.
