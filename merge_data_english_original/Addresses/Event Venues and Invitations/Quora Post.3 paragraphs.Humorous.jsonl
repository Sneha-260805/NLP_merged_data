{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about good venues for a wedding reception in Delhi NCR, right? Well, *bhai*, let me tell you, the choices are endless... and mostly overpriced, LOL. First off, figure out your budget. Are we talking \"lakhs\" or \"crores\" for the banquet hall? Seriously! Some of these places near Gurgaon charge like ₹5000 per plate! My advice? Check out some of the \"farmhouse\" type places on the outskirts. You might actually get decent parking that way and not be stuck in a Sector 18 Noida type traffic jam!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about good venues for a wedding reception in Delhi N-C-R, right?

{"unnormalised": "Next, think about your guest list. Are we talking 200 people or 2000? Because that makes a HUGE difference. A cozy little \"function hall\" at a local community center in, say, Dwarka Sec-10, might be perfect for a smaller group, but a complete disaster for a big fat Punjabi wedding. Also, consider the season. If it's peak wedding season (like Nov-Dec), book WAY in advance. Like, NOW. Don't wait till the last minute, or you'll be stuck with that weird hall above the Vishal Mega Mart on GT Karnal Road!", "normalised": "Next, think about your guest list.

Bargain like you're buying vegetables at Azadpur Mandi. Good luck finding your \"dream\" venue.
