{"unnormalised": "Hey Redditors, so I'm planning my sister's wedding reception and am totally lost on venues. We're expecting around 250 guests, and ideally, it should be in or around Bengaluru. My parents are insistent on a place that's easily accessible, you know, not some obscure location deep in the outskirts. Something near, say, MG Road or Indiranagar would be perfect. Has anyone had good experiences with venues in that area? Budget is around ₹10 lakh, give or take a bit.", "normalised": "Hey R-e-d-d-i-t-o-r-s, so I am planning my sister's wedding reception and am totally lost on venues.

{"unnormalised": "One venue we saw online was \"The Royal Grand,\" address: No. 7, Cunningham Road, Bangalore - 560052. It looked pretty decent in the pictures, but I'm always skeptical about those things. Another suggestion from my uncle was \"The Taj West End,\" but that seems a bit too fancy (and probably way out of our budget!). Has anyone been to either of those for an event? The invitation cards need the address by 15/07/2024 so need to finalise ASAP.", "normalised": "One venue we saw online was \"The Royal Grand,\" address: Number seven, C-u-n-n-i-n-g-h-a-m Road, B-a-n-g-a-l-o-r-e - five six zero zero five two.
