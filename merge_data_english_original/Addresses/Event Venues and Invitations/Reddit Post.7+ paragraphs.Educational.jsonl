{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the structure. An Indian address, especially for event venues, can be a mix of building names, street numbers, area names, city names, and the all-important PIN code. For example, you might see something like “Hall No. 2, Community Centre, Sector 17, Gurgaon, Haryana 122001”. This isn’t always standardized, which can be confusing. Sometimes, the building name is missing altogether, or the street name is vaguely “MG Road” which, let’s be honest, exists in practically every Indian city.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the structure.

{"unnormalised": "A common issue is the lack of clear landmarks. Instead of a specific shop or monument, you might see \"Near XYZ Temple\" or \"Opposite ABC School\".

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the issue of numbering. Building numbers might not always be sequential or logically arranged. You could be looking for “House No. 23” and find it nestled between “House No. 15” and “House No. 50”. This is especially common in older neighborhoods or areas with unplanned development.

{"unnormalised": "The PIN code (Postal Index Number) is your best friend. This 6-digit number is crucial for postal services, and nowadays, for GPS navigation too. Make sure it’s accurate! A wrong PIN code can send your guests to a completely different part of the city, or even another city entirely. Double-check, triple-check, and then check again!
