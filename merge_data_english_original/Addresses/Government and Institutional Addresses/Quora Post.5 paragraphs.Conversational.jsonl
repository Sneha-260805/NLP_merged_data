For instance, if you need the address for the regional EPFO office, go to the EPFO website (good luck navigating it!). Often, they'll have a \"Contact Us\" or \"Locate Us\" section. You might find listings there. But always double-check because sometimes \"Sector 62, Noida, 201309\" on the site might actually be Sector 63 due to a typo. This happened to my friend, Rajesh. He went all the way to sector 62 only to find out the office had moved to sector 63 a year ago.", "normalised": "First, check the official website of the department or institution you're looking for.

It might take a while to get through, but you can directly ask for the full address, including the pin code. Just be patient and polite, and hopefully, the person on the other end will be able to help you out. Remember to confirm the complete address, including landmark if any.
