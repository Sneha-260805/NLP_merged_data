{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about finding govt offices, right? It's honestly a pain sometimes. Finding the right address, especially if you're new to the city, can be super confusing. Like, trying to find the Passport Office near me took me ages last month. The official address was something like \"Regional Passport Office, 8th Floor, MTNL Building, Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400051\". Good luck finding that without Google Maps, bhai!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about finding government offices, right? It is honestly a pain sometimes.

{"unnormalised": "And it's not just passport offices. Think about trying to find the Income Tax Department. They have offices all over the place! Imagine trying to find the \"Office of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, Aayakar Bhavan, P-7, Chowringhee Square, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700069\" by just asking around. You'd probably end up at a tea stall instead. Plus, these places often have multiple entrances and confusing layouts inside.", "normalised": "And it is not just passport offices.

{"unnormalised": "The problem is, these official addresses are often written in this super formal, official way.

{"unnormalised": "So, my advice? Always double-check the official address online, use Google Maps, and maybe even call the office beforehand to get some clear directions. Ask for the nearest metro station or a popular landmark. Otherwise, you might end up spending half your day wandering around looking for \"Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400051\" and missing your appointment! Good luck, yaar!", "normalised": "So, my advice? Always double-check the official address online, use Google Maps, and maybe even call the office beforehand to get some clear directions.
