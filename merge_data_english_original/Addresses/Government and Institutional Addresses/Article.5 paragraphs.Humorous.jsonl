You'll be given an address like \"B-4/9, Lajpat Nagar, Near the Old Water Tank, Behind the Hanuman Mandir, New Delhi, 110024.\" Great! Now just decipher that cryptic code and you're golden.

Oh, the landmarks. \"Opposite the building that used to be a cinema, next to the guy who sells amazing chai, but only on Tuesdays.\" How are tourists even supposed to survive? They’re probably wandering around Delhi right now, clutching their Google Maps, desperately seeking the elusive “Tuesday Chai Wala.” And don't get me started on the postal codes – 110024. Memorize that, and approximately 500 others, and you *might* find the right wing in the right building.", "normalised": "And the landmarks!
