{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me the other day about the correct format for writing addresses, especially when dealing with govt offices in India. It’s trickier than you think! When I was younger, I remember messing up my application forms because I didn't know the exact way to write the address. It's not just about the house number and street name; it's about the proper hierarchy and, honestly, sometimes deciphering what the actual address *is*. For example, trying to understand where \"C/o The Block Development Officer, Vill+PO: Mirzapur, Dist: Varanasi, UP, 221305\" actually IS can be a challenge.", "normalised": "Someone asked me the other day about the correct format for writing addresses, especially when dealing with government offices in India.

{"unnormalised": "See, you have to be meticulous. I always start with the individual's name or the department name, if sending something official. Then you include the building name or number, if available. After that comes the street name or locality. This is where you often see abbreviations like \"St\" for street or \"Rd\" for road. Next, the city or town, followed by the district (Dist:) if it's a rural area. Don't forget the state (e.g., MH for Maharashtra, TN for Tamil Nadu) and the all-important PIN code! Without the PIN, like 400001 for Mumbai GPO, your letter is as good as lost. Think of something addressed to \"The Superintendent of Police, Civil Lines, Allahabad, UP\". Could be anywhere in Civil Lines!", "normalised": "See, you have to be meticulous. I always start with the individual's name or the department name, if sending something official.

{"unnormalised": "So, to summarize, a typical government address might look something like this: \"The Director, National Informatics Centre, A-Block, CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi, 110003\". Following this order, with accurate details and the PIN code, will significantly increase the chances of your mail reaching its destination, even in the bureaucratic maze that is the Indian postal system! Remembering this has saved me a LOT of headaches.", "normalised": "So, to summarize, a typical government address might look something like this: \"The Director, National Informatics Centre, A-Block, C-G-O Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi, one hundred and ten thousand and three\".
