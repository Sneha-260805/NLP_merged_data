{"unnormalised": "Often, you'll find that official addresses are longer and more formal than what you're used to seeing for personal correspondence. They usually include a designation (like \"The Director\"), the name of the institution, the street name, the city, the state, and the pin code.

It’s way better to be safe than sorry and avoid any postal mishaps! A small mistake could mean delays or even lost documents.
