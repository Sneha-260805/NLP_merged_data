The address I gave was 22, Krishna Nagar Society, Near Diamond Market, Surat, Gujarat 395002. All pretty straightforward, right?", "normalised": "So, I had this super weird experience with a courier service last week. I ordered a saree for my mom’s birthday from a vendor in Surat.

I was like, \"Bhaiya, there's a difference! It’s not Krushna, it's Krishna, and it's a society, a proper residential area\". He then asks me if \"Near Diamond Market\" is \"Opposite Adajan Gam\". Like, what?! How does he expect me to know Surat geography like that? Eventually, after a lot of back and forth, I realised he was at 14/B, Krushna Appartment, Adajan, Surat 395009.

{"unnormalised": "Anyway, long story short, the saree reached my mom, but like 2 days late. Had to call the customer care helpline a gazillion times and give them the correct address AGAIN. Seriously, these delivery services need to train their guys properly. It’s not rocket science! Just read the freaking address, and use Google Maps, no? This whole thing cost me Rs 250 in calls. Never using that courier again. Will stick to Blue Dart or DTDC in the future. My mom almost didn't get her saree on her birthday. What a mess!", "normalised": "Anyway, long story short, the saree reached my mom, but like two days late.
