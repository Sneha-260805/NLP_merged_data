{"unnormalised": "Honestly, it depends on the courier service and the delivery person. Some, like Blue Dart and FedEx, are generally pretty good with addresses. Others, like Ekart, can be hit or miss. Things that will help are making sure your phone number is correct on the order and being available to answer when they call.
