{"unnormalised": "I think the issue is that different courier companies and delivery apps use slightly different addressing formats, which makes it confusing. DTDC, for example, might want a detailed breakdown (House No., Street, Locality, City, Pin Code), while Delhivery sometimes merges everything into one giant text box and hopes for the best. Even within the same app, the fields change depending on whether you're ordering food, groceries, or something else. So frustrating!", "normalised": "I think the issue is that different courier companies and delivery apps use slightly different addressing formats, which makes it confusing.

{"unnormalised": "My advice? Be as clear as possible. Put the full house number and street address in the \"Full Address\" line, even if it overflows a bit. Use the \"Landmark\" field religiously - \"Near XYZ Temple\" or \"Opposite ABC Hospital\" are gold. And always double-check the pin code!
