I mean, include the house no., street name, locality, city, state AND the PIN code. Don't forget the PIN code! So many delivery guys rely on that.

Even better if you can add contact numbers.", "normalised": "First, the most obvious thing: double, triple check your address. Write the full address, not just \"near the big tree\".
