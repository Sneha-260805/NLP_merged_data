{"unnormalised": "First thing, pack it REALLY well. I mean, think apocalypse level packing. Bubble wrap, good quality tape, the whole shebang. Then, when you book the courier, declare the value accurately. Don’t undervalue it to save a few Rs., because if something happens, that’s all you’ll get back. I used Blue Dart, their office is near my house at 18/A, Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata 700019. They were pretty good, even offered insurance for an extra ₹200.", "normalised": "First thing, pack it really well. I mean, think apocalypse level packing.

Like, BIG letters. Something like \"Priya Sharma, 45, 1st Main Road, Jayanagar, Bangalore, 560011. Ph: 9876543210\". Better safe than sorry, right? And for very important documents or jewellery, consider using registered post; the local post office near me at GPO, Dalhousie Square, Kolkata, 700001 offers that facility, its usually much safer for high value items.", "normalised": "Always, always get tracking.
