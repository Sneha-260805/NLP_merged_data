{"unnormalised": "At its core, an Indian address typically follows a hierarchical structure, moving from the most specific to the least specific information. The first line usually includes the recipient's name, followed by the house number or building name. For instance, \"Priya Sharma, Flat No. 201, ABC Apartments\" would be a typical starting point. In rural areas, \"S/o Rakesh Kumar\" (Son of Rakesh Kumar) or \"W/o Anjali Devi\" (Wife of Anjali Devi) are often included, especially when the recipient’s name isn’t widely known or readily available.", "normalised": "At its core, an Indian address typically follows a hierarchical structure, moving from the most specific to the least specific information.

In some cases, a landmark is added for extra clarity, such as \"Near State Bank of India, MG Road\".

{"unnormalised": "The final and perhaps most critical element is the Postal Index Number, or PIN code. This 6-digit code is a vital tool for sorting and delivering mail efficiently. For example, 560001 corresponds to Bangalore GPO (General Post Office). Using an incorrect or missing PIN code can lead to significant delays or misdirection. The PIN code system was introduced on 15/08/1972, revolutionizing the sorting process for India Post.", "normalised": "The final and perhaps most critical element is the Postal Index Number, or P-I-N code.

{"unnormalised": "When addressing packages for delivery by private courier companies, it’s crucial to include a contact phone number. Courier services like FedEx and DHL often require phone numbers to coordinate deliveries, especially if there are issues locating the address or if the recipient needs to be contacted for further instructions. This is particularly true in densely populated urban areas like Mumbai, where addresses can be complex and hard to locate.", "normalised": "When addressing packages for delivery by private courier companies, it’s crucial to include a contact phone number.

{"unnormalised": "Common errors in Indian addresses include incorrect spelling of street names, missing PIN codes, and ambiguous landmarks. For example, instead of writing \"45, Linking Road, Bandra West, Mumbai, 400050\", a recipient may write \"45 Linking Rd, Bandra(W), Mumbai\". While locally understood, it might cause confusion for delivery personnel unfamiliar with the area. Always double-check address details, especially the PIN code, to minimize the chance of delivery problems.
