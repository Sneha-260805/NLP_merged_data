{"unnormalised": "So, first off, for measuring medicines, you'll often see things like \"mg\" (milligrams) or \"ml\" (milliliters). Think your Paracetamol 500mg or a cough syrup dose of 5ml. Doctors also talk about \"mcg\" or \"µg\" (micrograms), which are even smaller. For injections, they might use \"IU\" (International Units), especially for things like insulin. And don't forget about \"cc,\" which is the same as ml, you'll hear older doctors saying \"2cc\" instead of 2 ml.", "normalised": "So, first off, for measuring medicines, you'll often see things like \"milligrams\" or \"milliliters.\" Think your Paracetamol five hundred milligrams or a cough syrup dose of five milliliters.
