{"unnormalised": "A rather unusual case surfaced at AIIMS Delhi earlier this week, highlighting the critical importance of precise measurements in healthcare. Mrs. Kavita Sharma, a 62-year-old resident of Gurgaon, was admitted with complaints of severe abdominal pain. Initial tests suggested a possible kidney stone, prompting doctors to order a CT scan. However, a miscommunication regarding the dosage of contrast dye nearly led to a serious complication.", "normalised": "A rather unusual case surfaced at A-I-I-M-S Delhi earlier this week, highlighting the critical importance of precise measurements in healthcare. Missus Kavita Sharma, a sixty two-year-old resident of Gurgaon, was admitted with complaints of severe abdominal pain. Initial tests suggested a possible kidney stone, prompting doctors to order a C-T scan. However, a miscommunication regarding the dosage of contrast dye nearly led to a serious complication."}
{"unnormalised": "The standard dose of the contrast agent, used to enhance the visibility of internal organs in imaging, is usually calculated based on the patient's weight, roughly 2ml per kg. In Mrs. Sharma's case, weighing approximately 70 kg, she should have received around 140ml. However, due to a clerical error, the order sheet indicated 200 cc, a slightly higher but potentially dangerous quantity, especially considering her age and existing kidney function.", "normalised": "The standard dose of the contrast agent, used to enhance the visibility of internal organs in imaging, is usually calculated based on the patient's weight, roughly two milliliter per kilogram. In Missus Sharma's case, weighing approximately seventy kilogram, she should have received around one hundred and forty milliliter. However, due to a clerical error, the order sheet indicated two hundred cubic centimeter, a slightly higher but potentially dangerous quantity, especially considering her age and existing kidney function."}
{"unnormalised": "Thankfully, the attending radiologist, Dr. Rajesh Kumar, noticed the discrepancy just before administering the dye. He promptly cross-verified the dosage with the referring physician and the patient's medical history. \"It was a close call,\" Dr. Kumar stated. \"Administering that extra 60ml could have significantly worsened her kidney function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.\" The correct dose was then administered, and the CT scan proceeded without incident.", "normalised": "Thankfully, the attending radiologist, Doctor Rajesh Kumar, noticed the discrepancy just before administering the dye.
