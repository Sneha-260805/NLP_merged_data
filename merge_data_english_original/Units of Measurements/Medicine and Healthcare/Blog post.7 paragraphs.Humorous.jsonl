{"unnormalised": "So, last week, I woke up with a headache that felt like a cricket team was practicing in my skull. Being the brave, medically-inclined person (read: someone who Googles symptoms instead of going to a real Dr.), I decided to self-diagnose. Turns out, I had a \"severe headache\" according to the internet's incredibly precise diagnosis. Great. But how severe *exactly*? Was it a 500mg Paracetamol kind of headache, or a \"call mom and whine\" level of pain? This got me thinking about measurements in medicine, and let me tell you, it's a wild ride!", "normalised": "So, last week, I woke up with a headache that felt like a cricket team was practicing in my skull.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it. How much medicine *should* you take? You're told to take, say, 10 ml of cough syrup. But whose ml? Is it my small, chai-stained spoon ml, or a properly calibrated, government-approved ml? And what even *is* an ml, really? Is it just a fancy way of saying \"a little bit\"?

But is that 100°F in Delhi heat bad, or 100°F \"need to wrap yourself in a blanket\" bad? Context matters, people! And let's not even get started on Celsius. I still haven't figured out how to convert that in my head without needing a calculator and a strong cup of chai. It's all very confusing and I end up more stressed than when I started.", "normalised": "Then there's temperature. You're feeling feverish, so you grab the thermometer.

{"unnormalised": "Talking of weight, I once tried following a recipe that asked for \"2 grams of saffron.\" Two grams! Do you know how much saffron that is? That’s like asking me to count the number of stars in the sky using only a jalebi as a telescope. Saffron costs more than my monthly rent, and I’m supposed to accurately measure out 2 grams?

So, the next time you're faced with a confusing medical measurement, just remember this: It's all a bit of a guessing game, a bit of science, and a whole lot of hoping for the best. And maybe, just maybe, a strong cup of chai can cure it all. Or at least, make you forget about the confusing measurements for a little while.
