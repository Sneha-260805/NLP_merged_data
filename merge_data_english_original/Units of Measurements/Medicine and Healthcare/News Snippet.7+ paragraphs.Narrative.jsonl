{"unnormalised": "The study, conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), surveyed 500 pharmacies in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Shockingly, 35% of the pharmacies used uncalibrated measuring devices, leading to inaccurate dosages. For instance, a prescription calling for 5 ml of cough syrup was sometimes dispensed as 4.5 ml or even 6 ml due to faulty droppers or syringes.", "normalised": "The study, conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (A-I-I-M-S), surveyed five hundred pharmacies in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Shockingly, thirty five percent of the pharmacies used uncalibrated measuring devices, leading to inaccurate dosages. For instance, a prescription calling for five milliliter of cough syrup was sometimes dispensed as four point five milliliter or even six milliliter due to faulty droppers or syringes."}

Sharma, head of the pharmacology department at AIIMS. “An underdose might render the medication ineffective, while an overdose could have severe side effects, especially in pediatric patients.” He further added that in some cases, the provided measuring cup had markings that were off by as much as 10%, a potentially dangerous margin for certain medications.", "normalised": "“The implications are serious,” stated Doctor R.

Sharma, head of the pharmacology department at A-I-I-M-S. “An underdose might render the medication ineffective, while an overdose could have severe side effects, especially in pediatric patients.” He further added that in some cases, the provided measuring cup had markings that were off by as much as ten percent, a potentially dangerous margin for certain medications."}
{"unnormalised": "The report also found that many pharmacies were unaware of the specific gravity of different liquid medications. This is crucial because 5 ml of one medicine might not weigh the same as 5 ml of another, impacting the actual dosage received. Some medicines are measured in units of weight, such as milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), based on a patient's weight, while others rely on volumetric measures.", "normalised": "The report also found that many pharmacies were unaware of the specific gravity of different liquid medications.

{"unnormalised": "Several pharmacies admitted to relying on \"andaaz\" or estimations, especially during peak hours. In one instance, a pharmacist in Kolkata was observed using a teaspoon to measure a child's antibiotic dosage, admitting he didn't have the correct syringe size on hand. A standard teaspoon holds approximately 5.92 ml, which could significantly skew the prescribed dosage.", "normalised": "Several pharmacies admitted to relying on \"andaaz\" or estimations, especially during peak hours.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the study revealed a lack of standardized training for pharmacy staff regarding accurate measurement techniques. Many assistants were unaware of the difference between a milliliter (ml) and a cubic centimeter (cc), mistakenly believing they were interchangeable. While they are approximately equal (1 ml ≈ 1 cc), the lack of precision highlights a critical gap in knowledge.", "normalised": "Moreover, the study revealed a lack of standardized training for pharmacy staff regarding accurate measurement techniques.

{"unnormalised": "Experts are calling for stricter regulations and mandatory training programs for pharmacy staff to ensure accurate dosage measurements. The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) is reportedly reviewing the report and considering implementing new guidelines to address these concerns. These include mandating the use of calibrated measuring devices and providing regular training on dosage calculations and measurement techniques for all pharmacy personnel.", "normalised": "Experts are calling for stricter regulations and mandatory training programs for pharmacy staff to ensure accurate dosage measurements.
