{"unnormalised": "First off, accuracy depends on a bunch of things. Like, is it a cuff type (the classic arm squeeze) or a wrist one? Wrist ones can be a bit finicky 'cause you gotta hold your arm *just so* – kinda like balancing a plate of biryani while doing yoga. Cuff size matters too! Too small and it'll squeeze you like Auntiji's hug, giving you a falsely high reading. Check if it’s the right size – usually marked in cm (e.g., 22-32 cm). Also, remember to sit properly, feet flat on the floor, back supported... you're not chilling at a chai stall, you’re doing SCIENCE!", "normalised": "First off, accuracy depends on a bunch of things.

{"unnormalised": "Another gotcha – those readings fluctuate more than a Bollywood actor's career! Don't freak out if you get 140/90 mmHg one minute and 120/80 mmHg the next.

{"unnormalised": "Think of your BP as your daily dose of entertainment. The monitor is the comedian, and your arm is the audience. Set the stage (right posture, right cuff), listen carefully (monitor readings), and sometimes… you get a joke you don't quite understand. If that joke is repeatedly concerning, visit a qualified medical professional, ok? And for all that is holy, get your monitor calibrated every year or two.
