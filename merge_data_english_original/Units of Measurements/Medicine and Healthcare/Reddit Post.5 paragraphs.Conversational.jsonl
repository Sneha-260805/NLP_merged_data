Like, one minute they're talking about your weight in kg, which is fine, but then the doctor's scribbling down some dosage in mcg, and honestly, who knows how many of those make a mg, let alone a g! My nanima always used desi totkas where everything was measured in tolas and chammach, but even that felt more consistent, you know?", "normalised": "Hey folks, anyone else feel like the units they use in hospitals are kind of all over the place?

What's with all the abbreviations? Then, when they were asking about my water intake, it was all in ml. I drink from a bottle, not a graduated cylinder! Why can't we just stick to standard units that regular people understand? My cousin, who's a nurse, says they have to convert between units all the time, and it's a recipe for disaster.
