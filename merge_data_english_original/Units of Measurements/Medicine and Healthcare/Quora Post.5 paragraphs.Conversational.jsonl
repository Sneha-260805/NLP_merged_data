So, if your doctor prescribes Paracetamol 500mg, that's half a gram. Another one you might see is micrograms (mcg or µg). That's super tiny - 1mg = 1000mcg!", "normalised": "First off, the most common unit you will see is milligrams (m-g). Think of it like a tiny pinch of something. Then you have grams (g), which is a bigger amount – one gram is equal to one thousand milligrams. So, if your doctor prescribes Paracetamol five hundred milligrams, that is half a gram.

{"unnormalised": "Sometimes, liquids are measured in milliliters (mL). This is about the same as a teaspoon. If the syrup bottle says “take 5mL twice a day”, that’s basically 1 teaspoon each time. Eye drops, on the other hand, might be measured in microliters (µL), especially for glaucoma meds, where every drop counts. For things like insulin, we use units (U). The concentration matters here, usually it's U-100, meaning 100 units of insulin per mL. So, read the label carefully!", "normalised": "Sometimes, liquids are measured in milliliters (m-L).

{"unnormalised": "Now, why so many units? It's all about precision. Too much medicine can be harmful, and too little won’t work. For kids, dosages are often calculated based on their weight, like 10mg/kg of body weight. That's why it's crucial to tell your doctor your exact weight in kgs so they can get it right. Always double-check with the pharmacist too. They're experts at this stuff and can catch any mistakes!", "normalised": "Now, why so many units? It is all about precision.
