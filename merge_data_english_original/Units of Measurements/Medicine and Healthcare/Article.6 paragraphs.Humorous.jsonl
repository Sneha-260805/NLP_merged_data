And then comes the fun part: the measurements. 5 ml? 100 mg? Suddenly, we’re back in school, desperately trying to remember if a teaspoon is bigger or smaller than a tablespoon. (Spoiler alert: it's smaller. Don't overdose on that cough syrup!). I remember my grandmother trying to measure \"a pinch\" of haldi.

They might be a pain to remember sometimes, but they’re keeping us safe and (relatively) sane. And remember, when in doubt, always ask your pharmacist or doctor for clarification. Otherwise, you might just end up with a daal that glows in the dark!
