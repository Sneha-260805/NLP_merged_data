{"unnormalised": "Firstly, consider liquid medications. You'll often see volumes prescribed in mL (milliliters). For instance, a cough syrup might be \"5 mL thrice a day.\" In older prescriptions, you might even see cc (cubic centimeters), but mL is now the standard. Sometimes, especially with IV fluids, you'll encounter liters (L). For example, \"administer 1L of normal saline over 8 hours.\" Always double-check if unsure of the units.", "normalised": "Firstly, consider liquid medications.

{"unnormalised": "For solid medications, milligrams (mg) and grams (g) are the most common units of mass. A typical paracetamol tablet might be \"500 mg every 6 hours as needed.\" Stronger medications, like certain antibiotics, can be prescribed in grams, like \"1 g IV every 12 hours.\" Micrograms (mcg) are used for very potent drugs, like some hormones. Always be careful with conversions; 1 g equals 1000 mg, and 1 mg equals 1000 mcg.", "normalised": "For solid medications, milligram and gram are the most common units of mass. A typical paracetamol tablet might be \"five hundred milligram every six hours as needed.\" Stronger medications, like certain antibiotics, can be prescribed in grams, like \"one gram I-V every twelve hours.\" Microgram are used for very potent drugs, like some hormones. Always be careful with conversions; one gram equals one thousand milligram, and one milligram equals one thousand microgram."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond medication, body measurements are crucial. Height is generally recorded in cm (centimeters) or inches (in), and weight in kilograms (kg) or pounds (lbs). Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using these measurements. A report might state, \"Patient's height: 175 cm, weight: 70 kg, BMI: 22.9.\" These values are vital for assessing overall health and guiding treatment plans.", "normalised": "Beyond medication, body measurements are crucial. Height is generally recorded in centimeter or inches, and weight in kilogram or pounds. Body Mass Index B-M-I is calculated using these measurements. A report might state, \"Patient's height: one hundred and seventy five centimeter, weight: seventy kilogram, B-M-I: twenty two point nine.\" These values are vital for assessing overall health and guiding treatment plans."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, various tests report measurements in specific units. Blood glucose levels are typically expressed in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) or mmol/L (millimoles per liter). A normal fasting glucose might be \"80 mg/dL.\" Similarly, blood pressure is recorded in mmHg (millimeters of mercury), for example, \"120/80 mmHg.\" Understanding these units helps interpret test results and monitor health conditions effectively. Always ask your doctor if you're unclear about any measurement.", "normalised": "Finally, various tests report measurements in specific units.
