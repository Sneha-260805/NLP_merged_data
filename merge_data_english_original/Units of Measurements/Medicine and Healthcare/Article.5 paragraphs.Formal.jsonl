{"unnormalised": "In the pharmaceutical domain, dosages are meticulously calculated and administered based on weight and volume. Solid medications are commonly prescribed in milligrams (mg) or grams (g), while liquid formulations are measured in milliliters (mL) or liters (L). For instance, a prescription might specify “Amoxicillin 250mg, thrice daily” or “Ibuprofen suspension 5mL every 6 hours”. Conversion between these units must be performed with utmost care, as a miscalculation can lead to under- or over-dosing. Indian pharmacopeia specifies the standards for these measurements and their permissible variations.", "normalised": "In the pharmaceutical domain, dosages are meticulously calculated and administered based on weight and volume.

{"unnormalised": "Physiological parameters also rely heavily on standardized units of measurement. Blood pressure is recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), with a reading of 120/80 mmHg considered normal. Body temperature is typically measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F), where 37°C (98.6°F) is the average normal temperature. Blood glucose levels are expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with a target range of 70-100 mg/dL for fasting blood sugar. These measurements provide vital information about a patient's health status and guide diagnostic and treatment decisions. In critical care, monitoring of urine output in mL/hr is crucial for assessing kidney function.", "normalised": "Physiological parameters also rely heavily on standardized units of measurement. Blood pressure is recorded in millimeters of mercury, with a reading of one hundred and twenty divided by eighty millimeters of mercury considered normal. Body temperature is typically measured in degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit, where thirty seven degrees Celsius (ninety eight point six degrees Fahrenheit) is the average normal temperature. Blood glucose levels are expressed in milligrams per deciliter, with a target range of seventy to one hundred milligrams per deciliter for fasting blood sugar.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures magnetic field strength in Tesla (T), while computed tomography (CT) scans quantify radiation absorption in Hounsfield units (HU). Ultrasound imaging measures the frequency of sound waves in Hertz (Hz). The accurate interpretation of these measurements requires specialized training and expertise.", "normalised": "Furthermore, medical imaging techniques utilize various units of measurement to quantify anatomical structures and physiological processes.
