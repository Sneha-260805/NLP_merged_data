{"unnormalised": "The study, conducted by a team from AIIMS Delhi, examined 150 pharmacies in Delhi-NCR. Researchers discovered that approximately 35% of pharmacies were dispensing liquid medicines using unmarked or inaccurate measuring devices, such as household teaspoons, instead of standardized medical droppers or syringes. This can lead to considerable dosage errors, with some patients receiving up to 20% more or less medication than prescribed.", "normalised": "The study, conducted by a team from A-I-I-M-S Delhi, examined one hundred and fifty pharmacies in Delhi-N-C-R. Researchers discovered that approximately thirty five percent of pharmacies were dispensing liquid medicines using unmarked or inaccurate measuring devices, such as household teaspoons, instead of standardized medical droppers or syringes. This can lead to considerable dosage errors, with some patients receiving up to twenty percent more or less medication than prescribed."}
{"unnormalised": "\"The lack of standardized measurement tools is a serious concern,\" stated Dr. Rajesh Kumar, lead author of the study and Head of Pharmacology at AIIMS. \"While a teaspoon might seem like a common and convenient option, its volume can vary significantly, from as little as 2.5 ml to as much as 7.5 ml. Such variations can have dire consequences, especially when administering medications like antibiotics or cough syrups to children, where precise dosing is crucial.”", "normalised": "\"The lack of standardized measurement tools is a serious concern,\" stated Doctor Rajesh Kumar, lead author of the study and Head of Pharmacology at A-I-I-M-S. \"While a teaspoon might seem like a common and convenient option, its volume can vary significantly, from as little as two point five milliliter to as much as seven point five milliliter. Such variations can have dire consequences, especially when administering medications like antibiotics or cough syrups to children, where precise dosing is crucial.”"}
{"unnormalised": "The research also pointed out that even calibrated measuring devices can lose their accuracy over time with frequent use, cleaning, or exposure to extreme temperatures. A syringe marked for 5 ml might deliver as little as 4.2 ml after some time. The study recommends pharmacies to provide patients with standardized medical droppers/syringes clearly calibrated in ml units along with the liquid medications.", "normalised": "The research also pointed out that even calibrated measuring devices can lose their accuracy over time with frequent use, cleaning, or exposure to extreme temperatures. A syringe marked for five milliliter might deliver as little as four point two milliliter after some time. The study recommends pharmacies to provide patients with standardized medical droppers slash syringes clearly calibrated in milliliter units along with the liquid medications."}
{"unnormalised": "One concerning finding was that nearly 60% of pharmacists surveyed were unaware of the wide variation in volumes that a household teaspoon could hold. Dr. Kumar emphasized the need for enhanced training for pharmacy staff on accurate medication dispensing techniques. The study recommends that the Pharmacy Council of India incorporate a module on dosage measurement accuracy in the pharmacy curriculum.", "normalised": "One concerning finding was that nearly sixty percent of pharmacists surveyed were unaware of the wide variation in volumes that a household teaspoon could hold.

{"unnormalised": "The report further suggested that labeling on liquid medications should include explicit instructions for measuring the dose in ml units, and avoid ambiguous terms like \"teaspoon\" or \"tablespoon\" completely. Some medications even require measurements down to 0.25 ml for infants. A clear illustration of the correct measurement technique on the medication label would also be beneficial.", "normalised": "The report further suggested that labeling on liquid medications should include explicit instructions for measuring the dose in milliliter units, and avoid ambiguous terms like \"teaspoon\" or \"tablespoon\" completely.

The lack of standardized measurement tools and awareness poses a significant risk to public health and highlights the importance of patient education and awareness about medication dosage accuracy.", "normalised": "These findings underscore the urgent need for stricter regulations and guidelines to ensure accurate medication dispensing practices across all pharmacies in India.
