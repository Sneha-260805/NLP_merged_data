{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I’ve been trying to understand something about medicine dosages and I’m hoping someone can shed some light. I keep seeing different units used, and it’s kinda confusing. For example, my doctor prescribed me a syrup in ml (milliliters) but the tablets I take are usually measured in mg (milligrams). Is there any way to easily convert between them? Or is it even possible since they measure different things? My grandma, she only understands tolas, like \"ek tola honey\" for cough, haha!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I’ve been trying to understand something about medicine dosages and I’m hoping someone can shed some light.

{"unnormalised": "I get that ml is for liquid volume, and mg is for the mass of the medicine itself. I guess what I’m really asking is, when you see a doctor recommend \"10 ml of cough syrup,\" how do they know that's the right amount of the active ingredient? And what about those eye drops? They say things like \"1 drop in each eye, 2 times a day.\" How much medicine is actually in \"1 drop\"? Does it depend on the size of the bottle or something?", "normalised": "I get that milliliter is for liquid volume, and milligram is for the mass of the medicine itself.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the question of IV fluids. My uncle was in the hospital, and he was getting like 1000 cc of something through an IV drip. That sounds like a lot! Is cc the same as ml? And how do they decide how many liters someone needs? It all seems so precise and important, yet the units seem so different from what we use every day, like kgs for fruits or meters for cloth.", "normalised": "Then there's the question of I-V fluids.
