{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk weight. You might hear someone say they've lost \"2 kgs\" after a week of dieting. Everyone knows what kgs (kilograms) are, right? It's the standard way we measure weight in India. But then, your grandma might still be using \"seer\" or \"chatak\" for smaller quantities when talking about traditional remedies. Those units are ancient! Though, thankfully, we mostly stick to grams (g) or milligrams (mg) when dealing with medicines.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk weight.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's get to the fun part – medicines! If Dr. Sharma prescribes you Amoxicillin, it will probably be something like \"250 mg\" or \"500mg\" capsules. You'll also encounter terms like \"ml\" (milliliters) for syrups. Dosage is *super* important, guys, so don’t just go eyeballing it! Always follow the doctor's instructions. Also, ever noticed how IV fluids are often measured in \"L\" (liters)? Keep an eye on that bottle!", "normalised": "Now, let's get to the fun part slash medicines!

{"unnormalised": "Then there's blood pressure. You go to the clinic, and they tell you, \"120/80 mmHg\". What does that even mean? The \"mmHg\" part stands for millimeters of mercury and that’s the unit used to measure the pressure of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. It's a bit weird, I know, but that’s the global standard for measuring blood pressure. Understanding the units can actually help ease anxiety around seeing those numbers.", "normalised": "Then there's blood pressure.

{"unnormalised": "Think about body temperature. During fever season, we’re all running around checking our temperatures. We mostly use degrees Celsius (°C) here in India. A normal temperature is around 37°C but if the doc reports you have \"101°F\", that's degrees Fahrenheit, which is still used, mostly by doctors and can mean fever, depending on your baseline.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing to remember is height. Most doctors use cm (centimeters) or m (meters), although older folks will still ask how many \"feet and inches\" tall you are, and the conversion is always a math problem!
