{"unnormalised": "Firstly, understand the basic units. In India, we primarily use the metric system. This means you'll encounter grams (g), milligrams (mg), micrograms (mcg or µg), liters (L), and milliliters (mL) most frequently. For example, a typical Paracetamol tablet might contain 500mg of the active ingredient.", "normalised": "Firstly, understand the basic units. In India, we primarily use the metric system. This means you'll encounter grams (G), milligrams (M-G), micrograms (M-C-G or microgram), liters (L), and milliliters (M-L) most frequently. For example, a typical Paracetamol tablet might contain five hundred milligrams of the active ingredient."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, the conversions. 1g is equal to 1000mg. So, 2g is 2000mg. Similarly, 1mg is equal to 1000mcg. This means if a doctor prescribes 0.5mg of a medicine, that's the same as 500mcg. Dosage calculations are often based on body weight too. You might see something like \"10mcg/kg\" in a prescription, meaning 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. If a child weighs 20kg, they'd need 200mcg of the medicine.", "normalised": "Now, the conversions. One G is equal to one thousand M-G. So, two G is two thousand M-G. Similarly, one M-G is equal to one thousand M-C-G. This means if a doctor prescribes zero point five M-G of a medicine, that's the same as five hundred M-C-G. Dosage calculations are often based on body weight too. You might see something like \"ten M-C-G per K-G\" in a prescription, meaning ten micrograms per kilogram of body weight. If a child weighs twenty K-G, they'd need two hundred M-C-G of the medicine."}
{"unnormalised": "Fluid measurements are similar. 1L is equivalent to 1000mL. IV fluids are commonly measured in liters. A saline drip might be ordered as 1L of normal saline. The rate of administration also matters. You'll see things like \"50mL/hr,\" which means 50 milliliters per hour.", "normalised": "Fluid measurements are similar. One L is equivalent to one thousand M-L. I-V fluids are commonly measured in liters. A saline drip might be ordered as one L of normal saline. The rate of administration also matters. You'll see things like \"fifty M-L per hour,\" which means fifty milliliters per hour."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond these basics, you will also encounter units of measure specific to certain medications. For example, insulin is often measured in \"units\" (U). A typical insulin syringe might be marked in increments of 10 U (e.g. 10 U, 20 U, 30 U and so on). Dosages such as 40 U before meals can be common for patients with type 2 diabetes. With vaccines you might also see something like 0.5 ml administered intramuscularly for the flu.", "normalised": "Beyond these basics, you will also encounter units of measure specific to certain medications.

Dosages such as forty U before meals can be common for patients with type two diabetes. With vaccines you might also see something like zero point five M-L administered intramuscularly for the flu."}
{"unnormalised": "Concentrations are a challenge too. If a solution is labeled as \"10% solution,\" it usually means 10g of the solute per 100mL of solution. Sometimes, they will specify the concentration as 5mg/ml or 100 mg/5 ml to reduce calculation errors. You need to be very careful calculating dosage from solutions when you're using a percent or ratio concentration.", "normalised": "Concentrations are a challenge too. If a solution is labeled as \"ten percent solution,\" it usually means ten G of the solute per one hundred M-L of solution. Sometimes, they will specify the concentration as five M-G per M-L or one hundred M-G per five M-L to reduce calculation errors. You need to be very careful calculating dosage from solutions when you're using a percent or ratio concentration."}
{"unnormalised": "A common mistake I see is confusing micrograms and milligrams. Always double-check the units, especially in pediatric dosages. Also, be mindful of abbreviations. \"cc\" is sometimes used instead of \"mL,\" but it's better to stick with mL to avoid confusion. Always double check if unsure. Errors can happen when writing a prescription.", "normalised": "A common mistake I see is confusing micrograms and milligrams. Always double-check the units, especially in pediatric dosages.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the importance of accurate measuring devices is often overlooked. Using a household teaspoon (which is not a standard unit) to measure medicine is a definite no-no. Always use the measuring spoon or syringe that comes with the medicine, or a calibrated measuring cup. Even with these tools one needs to be accurate as even a few ml difference with small children could prove dangerous.", "normalised": "Finally, the importance of accurate measuring devices is often overlooked.
