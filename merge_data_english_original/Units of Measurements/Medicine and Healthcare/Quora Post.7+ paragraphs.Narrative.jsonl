{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's the generated Quora post, formatted as requested:", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I had a really strange experience at the doctor’s office the other day, and I'm hoping someone here can shed some light on it. It started with what I thought was just a mild fever, you know, feeling a bit under the weather. I checked my temperature at home with one of those digital thermometers, and it read thirty seven point eight degree celsius. Seemed pretty normal, just a slight increase."}

That's when I got a little worried. I called up Doctor Sharma's clinic; she’s my family physician. They told me to come in right away. Now, Doctor Sharma is usually quite thorough, but this time, things felt rushed."}

My B-P was reading one hundred and thirty divided by eighty five millimeter of mercury, which, according to my smart watch, was a bit high for me. Then she measured my height as one hundred and seventy five centimeter and weight as seventy eight kilogram. Then came the part that confused me. The doctor asked me about my fluid intake and started talking about measuring urine output in milliliter. I told her I usually drink about two point five liter of water a day, but she seemed focused on the urine."}

The results came back showing elevated levels of certain enzymes. The report showed things like S-G-P-T at sixty five U per L (I had to Google that!), and creatinine at one point two milligram per deciliter. I didn’t understand what any of it meant, and Doctor Sharma was brief."}

She didn't explain what it was for or what the measurements meant. I am a little worried, and she asked me to follow up after a week, but I have an anxiety as to why all of a sudden my urine has to be measured and what do these numbers mean for me in the long run."}

Should I be concerned about the elevated enzymes? Is it normal to have urine output tracked as medicine dosage is concerned? Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. It's just a bit unsettling when you don't understand what's going on with your own body, especially when these units of measurements are just floating around."}
