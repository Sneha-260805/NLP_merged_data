{"unnormalised": "The primary issue revolves around the inadequate standardization of measurement tools. Many families, particularly in lower-income households, rely on household spoons and cups for administering liquid medications. These utensils, while readily available, exhibit considerable variance in volume, leading to potential overdoses or underdoses. A teaspoon, nominally equivalent to 5 ml, can, in practice, range from 3 ml to 7 ml depending on the specific utensil.", "normalised": "The primary issue revolves around the inadequate standardization of measurement tools.

{"unnormalised": "A survey conducted across 1000 households in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar revealed that only 15% of families utilized calibrated syringes or droppers provided by healthcare professionals. The remaining 85% employed arbitrary methods, such as \"half a capful\" or \"a small spoon,\" which are inherently imprecise. This reliance on inexact measurements poses a significant risk, especially when administering potent drugs with narrow therapeutic windows.", "normalised": "A survey conducted across one thousand households in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar revealed that only fifteen percent of families utilized calibrated syringes or droppers provided by healthcare professionals.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of inaccurate dosing can be severe. Overdoses can lead to adverse reactions, organ damage, or even fatalities, particularly in infants and young children whose bodies are more vulnerable to medication toxicity. Conversely, underdoses can render treatments ineffective, prolonging illness and potentially contributing to antibiotic resistance.", "normalised": "The consequences of inaccurate dosing can be severe.
