Like, \"give your child 5 ml of this syrup, 3 times a day\" – ml stands for milliliters, a measure of volume. If you're admitted to a hospital, your height might be recorded as 170 cms which is centimeters. Things like your blood pressure are measured in mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). I remember my grandma’s BP always hovering around 140/90 mm Hg!", "normalised": "So, you'll often hear about weight in kilograms or grams when it comes to dosages, especially for kids.

If you have a fever, the doctor will ask \"kitna temperature hai?\" and you'll probably say something like \"101°C\"…. well, that would be dangerous! Always double-check if they mean Fahrenheit (°F) or Celsius. Doctors in India generally use Farenheit when talking to patients and Celsius in the prescription.", "normalised": "Another thing you'll see a lot is temperature – usually in degrees Celsius.
