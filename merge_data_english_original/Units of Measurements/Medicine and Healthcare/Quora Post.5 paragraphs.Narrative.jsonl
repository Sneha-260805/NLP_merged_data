{"unnormalised": "Well, as someone who's spent a fair bit of time navigating the Indian healthcare system, I've come across a variety of units, sometimes confusingly so. It's not always as straightforward as you'd think. For instance, blood glucose levels are frequently reported in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). I remember my grandmother’s report showing her glucose at 180 mg/dL and the doctor explaining what that meant in relation to her diabetes.", "normalised": "Well, as someone who's spent a fair bit of time navigating the Indian healthcare system, I've come across a variety of units, sometimes confusingly so. It's not always as straightforward as you'd think. For instance, blood glucose levels are frequently reported in milligram per deciliter. I remember my grandmother’s report showing her glucose at one hundred and eighty milligram per deciliter and the doctor explaining what that meant in relation to her diabetes."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's weight, which is usually recorded in kg (kilograms). My baby’s weight at birth was 3.2 kg, and every visit to the pediatrician involves checking his weight against the standard growth charts. Height, similarly, is documented in cm (centimeters). At his 6-month checkup, he was already 68 cm long! Understanding these basic measurements is crucial for tracking a child’s development.", "normalised": "Then there's weight, which is usually recorded in kilogram. My baby’s weight at birth was three point two kilogram, and every visit to the pediatrician involves checking his weight against the standard growth charts.

Understanding these basic measurements is crucial for tracking a child’s development."}
{"unnormalised": "When it comes to medication, the units can get even more diverse. Dosage is commonly prescribed in mg (milligrams) or mcg (micrograms). My doctor prescribed Amoxicillin 250mg three times a day when I had a throat infection. Intravenous fluids are often measured in mL (milliliters) or L (liters). During my hospitalization, I was administered 1L of saline solution over 8 hrs. Also, one must keep in mind about Units. Insulin doses are measured in units of Insulin.", "normalised": "When it comes to medication, the units can get even more diverse. Dosage is commonly prescribed in milligram or microgram. My doctor prescribed Amoxicillin two hundred and fifty milligram three times a day when I had a throat infection. Intravenous fluids are often measured in milliliter or liter. During my hospitalization, I was administered one liter of saline solution over eight hours. Also, one must keep in mind about Units. Insulin doses are measured in units of Insulin."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond these, vital signs such as blood pressure are measured in mmHg (millimeters of mercury). A normal reading, as my doctor told me, is around 120/80 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is expressed as a percentage (%). During my COVID infection, my SpO2 dropped to 92%, and that's when I knew I needed to get serious medical attention.", "normalised": "Beyond these, vital signs such as blood pressure are measured in millimeter of mercury. A normal reading, as my doctor told me, is around one hundred and twenty divided by eighty millimeter of mercury. Oxygen saturation is expressed as a percentage. During my C-O-V-I-D infection, my S-P-O-two dropped to ninety two percent, and that's when I knew I needed to get serious medical attention."}
{"unnormalised": "So, whether it's tracking blood glucose, measuring medication, or monitoring vital signs, a plethora of units come into play. It's important to have at least a basic understanding of these measurements to actively participate in your healthcare journey. The key is to always clarify any doubts with your doctor and understand what those numbers actually represent for your health.", "normalised": "So, whether it's tracking blood glucose, measuring medication, or monitoring vital signs, a plethora of units come into play.
