{"unnormalised": "In the medical field, precise measurements are crucial for accurate dosages and effective treatment. Medications are often prescribed using various units of measurement, including weight, volume, and concentration. For instance, dosages of solid medications, such as tablets or capsules, are typically expressed in terms of weight, like milligrams (mg) or grams (g). A common prescription might specify \"Paracetamol 500mg\" meaning each tablet contains 500 milligrams of the active ingredient. Similarly, for liquids, volume measurements like milliliters (ml) or liters (L) are employed. A doctor may prescribe \"Amoxicillin 250mg/5ml\" meaning there are 250mg of Amoxicillin in every 5 milliliters of the suspension.", "normalised": "In the medical field, precise measurements are crucial for accurate dosages and effective treatment.

A doctor may prescribe \"Amoxicillin two hundred and fifty m g slash five m l\" meaning there are two hundred and fifty m g of Amoxicillin in every five milliliters of the suspension."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, concentrations play a vital role in solutions and intravenous (IV) fluids. Concentrations can be expressed as a percentage (%), where a certain percentage of the solution is the active ingredient. For example, \"Dextrose 5% in Normal Saline\" indicates that the IV fluid contains 5% dextrose. Also molarity (M) and millimolarity (mM) are used especially in the pharmaceutical and research environments. Prescribing \"NaCl 0.9% solution\" or \"1000 mL of 0.9% NaCl IV\" both indicate the same concentration. It's essential to understand that these different units are often used interchangeably depending on context and the specific medication involved.", "normalised": "Furthermore, concentrations play a vital role in solutions and intravenous (I-V) fluids. Concentrations can be expressed as a percentage (percent), where a certain percentage of the solution is the active ingredient. For example, \"Dextrose five percent in Normal Saline\" indicates that the I-V fluid contains five percent dextrose. Also molarity (M) and millimolarity (m M) are used especially in the pharmaceutical and research environments. Prescribing \"N a C l zero point nine percent solution\" or \"one thousand m L of zero point nine percent N a C l I-V\" both indicate the same concentration. It's essential to understand that these different units are often used interchangeably depending on context and the specific medication involved."}

Consulting with a healthcare professional is always recommended to clarify any doubts regarding dosages or units of measurement in your prescriptions. It is critical to verify medication details with healthcare providers or pharmacists to ensure accuracy and safety in treatment.", "normalised": "Ultimately, understanding the unit of measurement ensures patients are administered the correct dose, maximizing the medication's effectiveness and minimizing potential side effects.
