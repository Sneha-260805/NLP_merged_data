It's vital to understand these to ensure patient safety and avoid errors when taking medicines. Often, we'll see things like \"500 mg\" of paracetamol. The \"mg\" stands for milligram, which is a unit of mass. Another common one is \"ml,\" which means milliliter. This is a unit of volume, used for liquids like cough syrups. Example: Take 10 ml of cough syrup TDS after food.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about dosages and amounts, so let us clear up common units used in medicine.

That means there are 10 grams of the active ingredient in every 100 ml of the solution. Sometimes, \"mcg\" is used which is microgram (one-thousandth of a milligram), often seen in Vitamin B12 injections (like 500 mcg). Doctors might prescribe something with \"IU\" also, meaning International Units, usually for vitamins like Vit D 60000 IU weekly.", "normalised": "Then there are units linked to concentration.
