Imagine giving a kid the wrong dose, things could go south real fast. So, understanding units of measurements becomes super important.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about dosage calculation in medicine.

{"unnormalised": "First off, you gotta know your basics. We're talking milligrams (mg), grams (g), kilograms (kg) for weight. For liquids, it's millilitres (mL) and litres (L). Sometimes you'll see micrograms (mcg or μg) too, especially for potent drugs. Remembering that 1g = 1000mg is fundamental. Just like 1L = 1000mL.

{"unnormalised": "Now, the dosage itself is often prescribed as, say, \"10mg per kg body weight\". So, if a child weighs 20kg, the required dose would be 10mg/kg * 20kg = 200mg.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's concentration to think about. Many liquid medications are not pure. You might have a syrup that's \"125mg per 5mL\". If you need to give 200mg, you'll have to calculate the volume required. It's like this: (200mg / 125mg) * 5mL = 8mL.
