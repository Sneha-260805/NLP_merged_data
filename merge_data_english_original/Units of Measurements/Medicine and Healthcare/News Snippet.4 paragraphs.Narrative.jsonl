{"unnormalised": "A recent study conducted at AIIMS Delhi has revealed inconsistencies in dosage measurements for common pediatric medications across local pharmacies. The study, which analyzed 500 prescriptions and corresponding dispensed medicines, found that in 15% of cases, the administered dosage deviated significantly from the prescribed amount. For instance, a prescription might call for 5ml of a syrup, but the measuring spoon provided could be inaccurately calibrated, delivering as much as 5.5 ml or as little as 4.5 ml.", "normalised": "A recent study conducted at A-I-I-M-S Delhi has revealed inconsistencies in dosage measurements for common pediatric medications across local pharmacies. The study, which analyzed five hundred prescriptions and corresponding dispensed medicines, found that in fifteen percent of cases, the administered dosage deviated significantly from the prescribed amount. For instance, a prescription might call for five milliliter of a syrup, but the measuring spoon provided could be inaccurately calibrated, delivering as much as five point five milliliter or as little as four point five milliliter."}
{"unnormalised": "Dr. Meena Sharma, the lead researcher, highlighted the potential risks, especially for infants and young children. She pointed out that a seemingly small discrepancy of 0.5 ml could be critical for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. They observed variations in measurements across different brands of oral syringes, with some indicating volumes in cc rather than ml, leading to confusion among parents. A parent mentioned in a focus group that they were uncertain if 2.5 cc was the same as 2.5 ml when giving their child cough syrup.", "normalised": "Doctor Meena Sharma, the lead researcher, highlighted the potential risks, especially for infants and young children. She pointed out that a seemingly small discrepancy of zero point five milliliter could be critical for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. They observed variations in measurements across different brands of oral syringes, with some indicating volumes in cubic centimeter rather than milliliter, leading to confusion among parents. A parent mentioned in a focus group that they were uncertain if two point five cubic centimeter was the same as two point five milliliter when giving their child cough syrup."}
{"unnormalised": "The study also found issues with weight-based dosages. Doctors often prescribe medications based on a child's weight in kg. However, many households still use imperial units (lbs) for measuring weight, leading to errors in dosage calculation. The research team documented instances where parents unknowingly administered incorrect doses due to miscalculating the weight conversion, emphasizing the urgent need for clear and standardised dosage instructions, ideally with both metric and imperial equivalents provided.", "normalised": "The study also found issues with weight-based dosages.
