{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's the news snippet about units of measurement in medicine and healthcare, designed to meet all the instructions and constraints:", "normalised": "The healthcare industry in India is undergoing a massive transformation, and one often-overlooked aspect is the standardized use of units of measurement. You wouldn't think it's a big deal, but inconsistent measurements can lead to huge problems, even life-threatening ones. Think about it: a doctor prescribing five milligram of a drug when the nurse thinks it's five microgram – that's a one thousand-fold error! We need to be on the same page, you know?"}

You wouldn't think it's a big deal, but inconsistent measurements can lead to huge problems, even life-threatening ones. Think about it: a doctor prescribing 5 mg of a drug when the nurse thinks it's 5 mcg – that's a 1000-fold error! We need to be on the same page, you know?", "normalised": "Recently, there's been a big push to ensure everyone uses the same language when it comes to measurements. For instance, talking about blood glucose levels, we're moving towards universally using millimole per liter instead of milligram per deciliter. A reading of, say, one hundred and twenty milligram per deciliter can be confusing, especially for patients who are used to the other system. Standardizing to, let's say, six point six millimole per liter eliminates ambiguity."}

For instance, talking about blood glucose levels, we're moving towards universally using mmol/L instead of mg/dL. A reading of, say, 120 mg/dL can be confusing, especially for patients who are used to the other system.

While we still hear readings like one hundred and twenty slash eighty millimeter of mercury, the focus is now also on making sure devices are properly calibrated and reported consistently. Even something as simple as a temperature check can be problematic if some hospitals use Celsius (degree Celsius) and others use Fahrenheit (degree Fahrenheit). A fever of one hundred and two degree Fahrenheit might seem alarming, but that's only thirty eight point nine degree Celsius, which, while still a fever, puts it in perspective."}

While we still hear readings like 120/80 mmHg (millimeters of mercury), the focus is now also on making sure devices are properly calibrated and reported consistently. Even something as simple as a temperature check can be problematic if some hospitals use Celsius (°C) and others use Fahrenheit (°F).

A child weighing fifteen kilogram needs a very different amount of medication than a child weighing twenty five kilogram. These calculations must be precise. Now, a lot of the newer electronic health record systems are incorporating these unit conversions and checks automatically. That helps reduce human error, which is a big win for patient safety."}

In X-rays and C-T scans, exposure is measured in units like millisievert. It's important for doctors to track cumulative exposure over a patient's lifetime, because excessive radiation can increase the risk of cancer. So, consistent and accurate reporting of these measurements is super important."}
