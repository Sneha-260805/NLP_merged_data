For liquid medications, things are often measured in mL (milliliters). For example, your cough syrup might say \"take 5 mL every 4 hours.\" Sometimes you'll see cc's too, which is the same as mL. Injections are frequently measured in mL as well.", "normalised": "Someone asked me what units of measurement are used in medicine, so I thought I'd share some common examples.

Certain vitamins might be measured in mcg (micrograms), which is even smaller than a milligram – 1000 mcg equals 1 mg. And sometimes you'll see things measured in units, especially for insulin (e.g., 10 units of insulin).", "normalised": "For solid medications, you'll typically find things in milligram or gram.
