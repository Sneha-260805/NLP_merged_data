{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. When it comes to medication, dosage is key. A doctor might prescribe 500 mg of Paracetamol for a fever, or 20 ml of cough syrup. The 'mg' stands for milligrams, which is a unit of weight, and 'ml' is milliliters, a unit of volume. Getting the right dose, measured accurately, is super important, otherwise you know, side effects could happen, or the med just might not work at all. Think of it like making chai, too much of one thing, too little of the other, and it just won't taste right!", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics. When it comes to medication, dosage is key.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's body temperature. We all know that normal body temp is around 37°C, right? That's Celsius. If your thermometer reads 39°C, you definitely have a fever. It's the same unit of measurement doctors and hospitals use to track your health. Understanding these basic temperature readings helps you communicate better with your doc and keep tabs on your health from home. No need to feel like a total dumbo when they throw those numbers at you!", "normalised": "Then there's body temperature.

{"unnormalised": "In hospitals, units of measurement are even more critical. IV drips are measured in ml/hr, blood pressure in mmHg, and oxygen levels as a percentage (like 98% SpO2). These precise measurements help healthcare professionals closely monitor a patient's condition and make quick decisions, that can literally be life-saving. Imagine the chaos if everyone just guessed at dosages! Total scene from a Bollywood comedy!", "normalised": "In hospitals, units of measurement are even more critical.

{"unnormalised": "Think about buying health supplements too. Vitamins often come in doses measured in mcg (micrograms) or IU (International Units). Knowing the difference can help you avoid overdosing, which can, believe it or not, happen and can cause health problems.
