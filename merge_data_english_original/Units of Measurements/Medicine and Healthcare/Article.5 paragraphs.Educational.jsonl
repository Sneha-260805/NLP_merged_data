{"unnormalised": "In the Indian healthcare system, precise measurements are crucial for accurate diagnoses and effective treatments. Healthcare professionals routinely use various units of measurement to assess patients' conditions, prescribe medications, and monitor treatment progress. Understanding these units is essential not just for medical personnel, but also for patients to better comprehend their health status and follow medical advice. This article aims to clarify some commonly used units of measurement in the Indian medical context.", "normalised": "In the Indian healthcare system, precise measurements are crucial for accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most frequently encountered measurements is body weight, typically expressed in kilograms (kg). For example, a patient might be described as weighing 75 kg, a key indicator for calculating medication dosages. Height is measured in centimeters (cm) or meters (m). A doctor might record a patient's height as 170 cm. Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated using weight and height (kg/m^2), is another important metric. A BMI of 28 kg/m2 may indicate that a person is overweight. Also vital is recording body temperature, usually measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F). A normal body temp is generally around 37°C.", "normalised": "One of the most frequently encountered measurements is body weight, typically expressed in kilograms. For example, a patient might be described as weighing seventy five kilograms, a key indicator for calculating medication dosages. Height is measured in centimeters or meters. A doctor might record a patient's height as one hundred and seventy centimeter. Body Mass Index (B-M-I), calculated using weight and height (kilograms divided by meter squared), is another important metric. A B-M-I of twenty eight kilograms per meter squared may indicate that a person is overweight. Also vital is recording body temperature, usually measured in degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit. A normal body temperature is generally around thirty seven degree Celsius."}
{"unnormalised": "Blood pressure is another critical parameter, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A reading of 120/80 mmHg is considered normal, while a reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher may indicate hypertension. Blood glucose levels are often measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL can be a warning sign of pre-diabetes. For more accurate diabetes monitoring, HbA1c is measured in percentage (%). An HbA1c of 6.5 % or higher is usually indicative of diabetes. In respiratory care, oxygen saturation, often displayed as SpO2 %, helps determine the effectiveness of lung function.", "normalised": "Blood pressure is another critical parameter, measured in millimeters of mercury. A reading of one hundred and twenty slash eighty millimeters of mercury is considered normal, while a reading of one hundred and forty slash ninety millimeters of mercury or higher may indicate hypertension. Blood glucose levels are often measured in milligrams per deciliter. A fasting blood sugar level of one hundred milligrams per deciliter can be a warning sign of pre-diabetes. For more accurate diabetes monitoring, H-b-A-one-c is measured in percentage. An H-b-A-one-c of six point five percent or higher is usually indicative of diabetes. In respiratory care, oxygen saturation, often displayed as S-p-O-two percent, helps determine the effectiveness of lung function."}
{"unnormalised": "Medication dosages are carefully prescribed in various units such as milligrams (mg), grams (g), and milliliters (mL). For instance, a doctor might prescribe 500 mg of paracetamol for fever or 10 mL of cough syrup. Intravenous (IV) fluids are often administered in liters (L) or milliliters (mL) over a specified time period. Monitoring fluid intake and output is also measured in ml or L, important especially for kidney failure patients. The concentration of electrolytes like sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) in the blood are expressed in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L).", "normalised": "Medication dosages are carefully prescribed in various units such as milligrams, grams, and milliliters. For instance, a doctor might prescribe five hundred milligrams of paracetamol for fever or ten milliliters of cough syrup. Intravenous (I-V) fluids are often administered in liters or milliliters over a specified time period. Monitoring fluid intake and output is also measured in milliliters or liters, important especially for kidney failure patients. The concentration of electrolytes like sodium (N-a plus) and potassium (K plus) in the blood are expressed in milliequivalents per liter."}
{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, familiarity with units like kg, cm, °C, mmHg, mg/dL, %, mL and mEq/L is crucial for both healthcare providers and patients to ensure proper assessment, monitoring and management of health conditions. These units serve as the bedrock for informed decision-making and play a vital role in delivering quality healthcare services across India.", "normalised": "In conclusion, familiarity with units like kilogram, centimeter, degree Celsius, millimeters of mercury, milligrams per deciliter, percent, milliliter and milliequivalents per liter is crucial for both healthcare providers and patients to ensure proper assessment, monitoring and management of health conditions.
