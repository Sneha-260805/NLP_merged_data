It's all about units of measurement, folks, and in medicine, they're not just important – they're hilariously specific. We’re talking about measuring things down to the mcg, or microgram - which, let's be honest, sounds like a tiny, disgruntled elf. Doctors need to know if you’re running a temp of 101°F or feeling just 37°C (because conversions are *fun*, right?). Forget “a pinch of salt”; in the medical world, it's \"2 mg of sodium chloride, stat!\"", "normalised": "Ever wondered why your doctor talks like they're fluent in a secret code filled with fractions and abbreviations?

It's like they’re giving you a fraction where the numerator and denominator both determine if you're having a good day. The ideal reading is 120/80 mmHg (millimeters of mercury), but honestly, trying to remember that number raises my blood pressure! Then there are fluid infusions given at rates like 500 ml/hr – that's a half-liter, folks, coursing through your veins every hour.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of weight, doctors always asking about your kilograms or lbs. Why can't they just ask, \"Do your clothes fit comfortably?\" Isn't that a more relatable measurement of overall well-being? \"Oh yes Doctor, my jeans are getting tight\" sounds much more relatable than \"I have gained 2 kgs since our last check up\".
