{"unnormalised": "First off, you've got your basic measurements. Body weight is usually in kg (kilograms). So, if a doc says \"the patient weighs 75 kg\", that's the standard. Height can be in cm (centimeters) or feet and inches, like \"170 cm\" or \"5'7\". Docs here in India use both! Sometimes they will ask your height in both cm and feet. No idea why they would do that.", "normalised": "First off, you've got your basic measurements. Body weight is usually in kilogram. So, if a doc says \"the patient weighs seventy five kilogram\", that's the standard. Height can be in centimeter or feet and inches, like \"one hundred and seventy centimeter\" or \"five feet seven inches\". Docs here in India use both! Sometimes they will ask your height in both centimeter and feet. No idea why they would do that."}
{"unnormalised": "For liquids, like IV fluids or medications, we're talking mL (milliliters) or L (liters). A typical saline drip might be 500 mL or 1 L. Syringes are usually measured in mL, like \"inject 2 mL of this medication.\" I have seen a few old doctors still use cubic centimetres which are just mL.", "normalised": "For liquids, like I-V fluids or medications, we're talking milliliter or liter. A typical saline drip might be five hundred milliliter or one liter. Syringes are usually measured in milliliter, like \"inject two milliliter of this medication.\" I have seen a few old doctors still use cubic centimeter which are just milliliter."}
{"unnormalised": "Blood pressure readings are in mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Normal BP is around 120/80 mmHg. Glucose levels are often in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). A healthy fasting blood sugar might be 70-100 mg/dL. You often see mmol/L used as well, but mg/dL is way more common here.", "normalised": "Blood pressure readings are in millimeter of mercury. Normal B-P is around one hundred and twenty slash eighty millimeter of mercury. Glucose levels are often in milligram per deciliter. A healthy fasting blood sugar might be seventy to one hundred milligram per deciliter. You often see millimole per liter used as well, but milligram per deciliter is way more common here."}
{"unnormalised": "Medications doses are where it gets a bit more varied. You might see mg (milligrams) for tablets or capsules, like \"take a 500 mg tablet of paracetamol.\" Some antibiotics are dosed in grams (g), like \"1 g of cefixime.\"", "normalised": "Medications doses are where it gets a bit more varied. You might see milligram for tablets or capsules, like \"take a five hundred milligram tablet of paracetamol.\" Some antibiotics are dosed in grams, like \"one gram of cefixime.\""}
{"unnormalised": "For things like inhalers, the dose is often in mcg (micrograms) or puffs. An asthma inhaler might deliver 100 mcg of medication per puff. Dosage calculations can be tricky because children need weight-based doses. You might see \"10 mg/kg of body weight per day\" for an antibiotic. It all depends on your weight in Kg!", "normalised": "For things like inhalers, the dose is often in microgram or puffs. An asthma inhaler might deliver one hundred microgram of medication per puff. Dosage calculations can be tricky because children need weight-based doses. You might see \"ten milligram per kilogram of body weight per day\" for an antibiotic. It all depends on your weight in kilogram!"}
{"unnormalised": "Lab values are also super important. Hemoglobin levels (for anaemia) are in g/dL (grams per deciliter). A normal range might be 12-16 g/dL for women and 14-18 g/dL for men. Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are usually measured in mEq/L (milliequivalents per liter).", "normalised": "Lab values are also super important. Hemoglobin levels (for anaemia) are in gram per deciliter. A normal range might be twelve to sixteen gram per deciliter for women and fourteen to eighteen gram per deciliter for men. Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are usually measured in milliequivalents per liter."}
{"unnormalised": "And finally, don't forget about temperature! In India, we usually use degrees Celsius (°C). Normal body temperature is around 37°C. A fever might be 38°C or higher. Most older folks and traditional healers in more rural areas still only know Farenheit, so you better know both!", "normalised": "And finally, don't forget about temperature!

{"unnormalised": "Hope this helps clear things up a bit! Medicine uses all sorts of units, but these are the most common you'll probably encounter. It's always good to ask your doc or pharmacist if you're unsure about anything. Stay healthy!", "normalised": "Hope this helps clear things up a bit!
