It lasted for 3 weeks, a scratchy, irritating sound that disturbed her sleep. She’d usually take her homemade cough syrup - a concoction of honey, ginger, and tulsi leaves - but this time, it didn’t work. \"It's probably just the change in weather,\" she’d say, downplaying the severity.

Each tablet is 500 mg,” he instructed. A week later, the cough hadn't subsided. In fact, it seemed to worsen. Dadi complained of feeling breathless, even after walking just 10 meters.
