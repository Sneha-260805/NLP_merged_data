{"unnormalised": "First off, volume. You'll often see liquid medications measured in mL (milliliters). For example, a cough syrup might say \"take 5 mL three times a day.\" Sometimes, you'll also encounter cc, which stands for cubic centimeters. Good to remember that 1 mL is equal to 1 cc, so don't get too worked up if you see either one! Doses for injectables are also given in mL (like a vaccine may require 0.5 mL dose).", "normalised": "First off, volume. You will often see liquid medications measured in milliliter.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's weight, primarily used for solid medications like tablets or capsules. Here, mg (milligrams) and g (grams) are your go-to units. A common painkiller, say, Paracetamol, is frequently available in 500 mg tablets. And remember, 1000 mg makes 1 g. Sometimes doctors might prescribe something in mcg (micrograms) like Vitamin B12 - and there are 1,000,000 mcg in 1 g. Conversions become very very important here.", "normalised": "Then there is weight, primarily used for solid medications like tablets or capsules. Here, milligram and gram are your go to units.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basic units, you might hear about \"IU,\" which stands for International Units. These are typically for vitamins and certain hormones where the measurement isn't as straightforward as weight or volume. For example, Vitamin D dosage is often specified in IUs, like \"60,000 IU once a week.\" Don't get it confused with just plain numbers either - those are just counts.", "normalised": "Beyond the basic units, you might hear about \"I U,\" which stands for International Units.
