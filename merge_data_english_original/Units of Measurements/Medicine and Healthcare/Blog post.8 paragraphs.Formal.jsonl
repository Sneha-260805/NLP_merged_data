{"unnormalised": "One of the most commonly encountered units is the milligram (mg), used extensively for quantifying drug dosages. For example, a physician might prescribe Paracetamol 500 mg for fever relief. Similarly, mcg or μg (micrograms) are often utilized for more potent medications, particularly in pediatric care, where precision is paramount. Understanding these units is critical for pharmacists and nurses administering medication. Incorrect dosage calculations, even by a small margin, can have serious consequences, especially for children.", "normalised": "One of the most commonly encountered units is the milligram (mg), used extensively for quantifying drug dosages.

{"unnormalised": "Fluid volume, essential for intravenous (IV) therapy and blood transfusions, is typically measured in milliliters (mL) or liters (L). A standard IV bag often contains 1000 mL of saline solution. Monitoring fluid intake and output is a vital aspect of patient care, particularly in cases of dehydration or renal dysfunction. Accurate recording of fluid balance helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions about fluid replacement and electrolyte management.", "normalised": "Fluid volume, essential for intravenous (I-V) therapy and blood transfusions, is typically measured in milliliters (mL) or liters (L). A standard I-V bag often contains one thousand milliliters of saline solution. Monitoring fluid intake and output is a vital aspect of patient care, particularly in cases of dehydration or renal dysfunction. Accurate recording of fluid balance helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions about fluid replacement and electrolyte management."}
{"unnormalised": "Blood pressure, a critical vital sign, is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A normal blood pressure reading is approximately 120/80 mmHg. Deviations from this range can indicate hypertension or hypotension, both of which require careful management. Doctors often rely on such readings to diagnose and manage conditions like heart failure and kidney disease.", "normalised": "Blood pressure, a critical vital sign, is measured in millimeters of mercury (m-m-H-g). A normal blood pressure reading is approximately one hundred and twenty divided by eighty m-m-H-g. Deviations from this range can indicate hypertension or hypotension, both of which require careful management. Doctors often rely on such readings to diagnose and manage conditions like heart failure and kidney disease."}
{"unnormalised": "Laboratory values, such as blood glucose levels and electrolyte concentrations, are expressed in various units. Blood glucose is often measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Serum sodium, a key electrolyte, is commonly reported in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). These measurements guide diagnosis and treatment for conditions like diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney disorders. For example, a fasting blood glucose level above 126 mg/dL may indicate diabetes.", "normalised": "Laboratory values, such as blood glucose levels and electrolyte concentrations, are expressed in various units. Blood glucose is often measured in milligrams per deciliter (m-g divided by d-L) or millimoles per liter (m-mol divided by L). Serum sodium, a key electrolyte, is commonly reported in milliequivalents per liter (m-E-q divided by L). These measurements guide diagnosis and treatment for conditions like diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney disorders. For example, a fasting blood glucose level above one hundred and twenty six m-g divided by d-L may indicate diabetes."}
{"unnormalised": "In diagnostic imaging, different units of measurement come into play. Radiologists utilize units like Hounsfield Units (HU) in CT scans to quantify the density of tissues. In MRI, signal intensity is assessed qualitatively, although specific parameters like T1 and T2 relaxation times can be quantified in milliseconds (ms). These units assist in the identification and characterization of abnormalities.", "normalised": "In diagnostic imaging, different units of measurement come into play.

These units assist in the identification and characterization of abnormalities."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond these fundamental units, more specialized measurements are used in specific medical fields. For instance, pulmonary function tests involve units like liters per second (L/s) to assess airflow. In cardiology, cardiac output is measured in liters per minute (L/min). Such units provide valuable insights into organ function and overall physiological status.", "normalised": "Beyond these fundamental units, more specialized measurements are used in specific medical fields.
