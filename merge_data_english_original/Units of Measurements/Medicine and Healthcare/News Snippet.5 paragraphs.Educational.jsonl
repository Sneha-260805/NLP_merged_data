A study published on 10/10/2024 underscores that using household spoons, like a \"chai chamach,\" can lead to significant dosage errors.

A study published on tenth October two thousand and twenty four underscores that using household spoons, like a \"chai chamach,\" can lead to significant dosage errors. While a standard teaspoon is supposed to hold approximately five milliliter, researchers found variations ranging from two point five milliliter to seven point eight milliliter depending on the spoon's size and shape."}
{"unnormalised": "This discrepancy can be particularly dangerous when administering liquid medications like antibiotics or cough syrups, where accurate dosing is crucial for efficacy and safety. For instance, giving a child with a weight of 15 kg medication requiring 2.5 ml thrice daily using an oversized spoon could lead to overdosage and potential side effects. Conversely, an undersized spoon may result in under-treatment, prolonging illness or leading to antibiotic resistance.", "normalised": "This discrepancy can be particularly dangerous when administering liquid medications like antibiotics or cough syrups, where accurate dosing is crucial for efficacy and safety.

{"unnormalised": "The study also emphasized the lack of standardization in measuring devices provided with medications. Some syrups come with droppers marked in ml, while others use oral syringes or measuring cups. Even these devices can vary in accuracy; one measuring cup might indicate \"5 ml\" while holding only 4.7 ml when tested with laboratory-grade volumetric pipettes. The margin of error can exceed 6%, which is not permissible.", "normalised": "The study also emphasized the lack of standardization in measuring devices provided with medications.

{"unnormalised": "The researchers recommend that healthcare professionals advise parents to use calibrated oral syringes or measuring cups provided by pharmacies, rather than relying on kitchen spoons. They also suggest that manufacturers prioritize providing standardized measuring tools with all liquid medications. Furthermore, the team suggested clear labeling that is easily comprehensible by the average person of the volume for each increment indicated on the measuring instrument.", "normalised": "The researchers recommend that healthcare professionals advise parents to use calibrated oral syringes or measuring cups provided by pharmacies, rather than relying on kitchen spoons.
