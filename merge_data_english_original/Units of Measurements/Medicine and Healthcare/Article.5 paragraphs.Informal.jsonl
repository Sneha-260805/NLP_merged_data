{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I wanted to chat about something super important, especially these days: measuring your medicines properly at home. I mean, we all know it's crucial, but sometimes, life gets hectic, and we can get a bit lax. But trust me, getting the right dose is key to feeling better and avoiding any unwanted side effects. It's not as complicated as it seems, promise!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I wanted to chat about something super important, especially these days: measuring your medicines properly at home.

{"unnormalised": "One common thing I've seen is people using kitchen spoons to measure liquid meds. Big no-no! A teaspoon, technically 5 mL, can vary wildly depending on your cutlery. One spoon might hold 4 ml, another 6 ml! Imagine giving your child cough syrup and not actually knowing if it’s the right dose. It's worth investing in proper measuring spoons or oral syringes; you can find them at any chemist shop for just Rs. 20-50. Seriously, tiny price for a big difference in accuracy.", "normalised": "One common thing I have seen is people using kitchen spoons to measure liquid meds. Big no-no!

{"unnormalised": "Another point - read the instructions *carefully*. The prescription might say \"10 mg/kg body weight\" – especially for kids’ medicines. This means you need to weigh yourself or your child first. Don't just guess! Those kgs matter. And even if it says \"1 tsp,\" make sure you use a proper measuring spoon. A “pinch of salt” approach simply doesn't fly with medication!", "normalised": "Another point - read the instructions *carefully*.

If your insulin vials aren't kept properly cold, it could mean that each 100 units/ml injection might not be as effective. I always set a reminder on my phone to check them regularly. Small steps like this make a significant change.", "normalised": "And do not forget about storage conditions.

{"unnormalised": "So, in a nutshell: ditch the kitchen spoons, get proper measuring tools, understand the dosage instructions (mg, ml, g – all important!), check your weight (and your kids’ weight if they're taking medication), and make sure you're storing those meds right (especially checking the temp). It might seem tedious, but your health (and your family's health) is worth the extra few minutes. Stay safe and take care!", "normalised": "So, in a nutshell: ditch the kitchen spoons, get proper measuring tools, understand the dosage instructions (milligram, milliliter, gram – all important!), check your weight (and your kids’ weight if they are taking medication), and make sure you are storing those meds right (especially checking the temp).
