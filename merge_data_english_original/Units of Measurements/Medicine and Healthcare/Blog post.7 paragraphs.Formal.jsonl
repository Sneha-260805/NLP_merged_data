{"unnormalised": "Medications are often prescribed in units of weight or volume. For instance, a common pain reliever like Paracetamol is frequently administered in dosages of 500 mg. Antibiotics, on the other hand, may be prescribed at 250 mg or higher, depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's weight. Liquid medications, such as cough syrups or pediatric formulations, are typically measured in milliliters (mL) or teaspoons (tsp). It's crucial to adhere to the prescribed dosage to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize the risk of adverse effects.", "normalised": "Medications are often prescribed in units of weight or volume. For instance, a common pain reliever like Paracetamol is frequently administered in dosages of five hundred milligram. Antibiotics, on the other hand, may be prescribed at two hundred and fifty milligram or higher, depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's weight. Liquid medications, such as cough syrups or pediatric formulations, are typically measured in milliliters or teaspoons. It's crucial to adhere to the prescribed dosage to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize the risk of adverse effects."}
{"unnormalised": "Height and weight measurements are fundamental in assessing a patient's overall health and nutritional status. Height is commonly recorded in centimeters (cm) or inches (in), while weight is measured in kilograms (kg) or pounds (lbs). Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated using height and weight, provides an indication of body fat and can help identify individuals who are underweight, overweight, or obese. For instance, a person with a height of 175 cm and a weight of 80 kg would have a BMI of approximately 26.1, indicating they are overweight.", "normalised": "Height and weight measurements are fundamental in assessing a patient's overall health and nutritional status. Height is commonly recorded in centimeter or inches, while weight is measured in kilograms or pounds. Body Mass Index (B-M-I), calculated using height and weight, provides an indication of body fat and can help identify individuals who are underweight, overweight, or obese. For instance, a person with a height of one hundred and seventy five centimeter and a weight of eighty kilogram would have a B-M-I of approximately twenty six point one, indicating they are overweight."}
{"unnormalised": "Vital signs, such as blood pressure and body temperature, also rely on specific units of measurement. Blood pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), with a normal reading around 120/80 mmHg. Body temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or degrees Fahrenheit (°F), with a normal range of 36.5°C to 37.5°C (or 97.7°F to 99.5°F). Monitoring these vital signs is essential for detecting and managing various medical conditions.", "normalised": "Vital signs, such as blood pressure and body temperature, also rely on specific units of measurement. Blood pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury, with a normal reading around one hundred and twenty slash eighty millimeters of mercury. Body temperature is measured in degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit, with a normal range of thirty six point five degrees Celsius to thirty seven point five degrees Celsius (or ninety seven point seven degrees Fahrenheit to ninety nine point five degrees Fahrenheit). Monitoring these vital signs is essential for detecting and managing various medical conditions."}
{"unnormalised": "Laboratory tests often involve measurements of various substances in blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Glucose levels, for example, are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Electrolyte concentrations, such as sodium and potassium, are typically expressed in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). These measurements are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.", "normalised": "Laboratory tests often involve measurements of various substances in blood, urine, or other bodily fluids.

The size of a tumor, for instance, may be measured in centimeters (cm) to track its growth or response to treatment. Radiation dosages used in radiotherapy are measured in Grays (Gy) or Sieverts (Sv) to ensure safe and effective treatment delivery.", "normalised": "Medical imaging techniques, such as X-rays, C-T scans, and M-R-Is, also utilize measurements to assess anatomical structures and identify abnormalities.
