{"unnormalised": "Often, vendors will quote prices per \"pav\" (250 gms), \"kilo\" (1 kg), or even unconventional units like \"a bunch\" for leafy greens. While these measures are widely understood within the Indian context, the absence of strict adherence to standard metric conversions causes considerable confusion. For instance, what one vendor defines as \"a bunch\" of spinach could vary significantly in weight from another, making it difficult to compare prices accurately. Similarly, the conversion from “ser” (approximately 933 gms) can vary depending on the region.", "normalised": "Often, vendors will quote prices per \"pav\" (two hundred and fifty grams), \"kilo\" (one kilogram), or even unconventional units like \"a bunch\" for leafy greens.

While some vendors employ electronic scales with a precision of 1 gm, others rely on traditional balance scales where the weight is estimated, potentially to the detriment of the consumer. Additionally, the habit of some vendors of weighing with their thumb on the scale can result in a variance of approximately 50-100 gms.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the informal nature of these transactions often leads to inaccuracies in weighing.
