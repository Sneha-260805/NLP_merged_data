{"unnormalised": "Was just thinking about how we talk about veggies and groceries here in India. It's kinda funny how many different measurement systems we juggle, right? Like, sometimes you'll hear \"ek pao\" of something, which is 250 gms, and other times people will just ask for \"aadha kilo\" (0.5 kg). Then, there's the whole \"ser\" thing that my grandma still uses - even though it's definitely not standardized anymore. Does anyone else find this confusing?", "normalised": "Was just thinking about how we talk about veggies and groceries here in India.

{"unnormalised": "And it's not just the traditional stuff. Even in the supermarket, you see a mix. Imported fruits are often sold by the pound (lb) – anyone ever try converting that in their head while comparing prices? It's a brain workout at the local DMart! Seriously, though, why haven’t we just fully adopted the metric system? It would make grocery shopping much easier, especially when comparing prices. Maybe we need a nationwide campaign to switch over or at least clarify the different units.", "normalised": "And it is not just the traditional stuff. Even in the supermarket, you see a mix.

{"unnormalised": "I remember this one time, I went to buy potatoes from a sabziwala near my house. He didn't have a proper weighing scale and just eyeballed it. He said \"approximately 1 kg,\" but when I weighed it later at home, it was more like 1.2 kg. I didn't mind much since potatoes are cheap but imagine if it was something expensive like saffron, measured in grams or even milligrams (mg)!

{"unnormalised": "Also, is it just me, or do vendors sometimes conveniently round up or down? Like, if something weighs 950 g, they'll often just call it 1 kg and charge accordingly. Or if you are only buying something small, you might hear cost quoted per 100 g instead of per kg. It really would be good for folks if prices were standardized and easily compared.", "normalised": "Also, is it just me, or do vendors sometimes conveniently round up or down?
