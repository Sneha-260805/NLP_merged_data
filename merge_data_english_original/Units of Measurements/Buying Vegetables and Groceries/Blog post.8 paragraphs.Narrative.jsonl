{"unnormalised": "So, the weekend rolled around, and as usual, it was time for the dreaded grocery run. Living alone in Mumbai means I have to be super organised, especially with the whole work-from-home situation still ongoing. I decided to hit the local farmer's market this time, hoping for fresher produce and maybe a slightly better deal than the reliance fresh nearby.", "normalised": "So, the weekend rolled around, and as usual, it was time for the dreaded grocery run.

{"unnormalised": "First stop, the veggies. I needed potatoes – at least 2 kg for the week. I usually end up making aloo parathas or some sort of sabzi. The vendor quoted me Rs. 30 per kg, which seemed reasonable enough. Then came the onions. Red onions are a must in every Indian household, right?

{"unnormalised": "Moving on from the veggies, I needed to stock up on some lentils. Moong dal, chana dal, and toor dal are the basics. I bought 1 kg of each, averaging about Rs. 120 per kg.
