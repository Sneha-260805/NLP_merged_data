He throws a vaguely cube-shaped lump on the scale. It reads \"two hundred and seventy five grams\". \"Chalega?\" he asks, with a twinkle in his eye. Of course, it \"chalega\". I am not about to argue over twenty five grams of paneer when I am already sweating in the Delhi heat. It is better to deal with the extra \"twenty five grams\" than to argue over a few rupees."}
