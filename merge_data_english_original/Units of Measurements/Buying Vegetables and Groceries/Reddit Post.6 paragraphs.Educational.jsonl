{"unnormalised": "First off, you’ll often hear vendors using “pao” (pav). 1 pav typically refers to 250 g (grams). So, if someone says they're selling tomatoes at Rs. 20 per pav, you know that's the price for 250 grams. Keep in mind, though, that the actual weight of \"pav\" can vary slightly depending on the vendor, so it's always good to double-check, especially if you're buying in bulk!", "normalised": "First off, you’ll often hear vendors using “pao” (pav). one pav typically refers to two hundred and fifty grams.

{"unnormalised": "Another important thing to keep in mind is the difference between weight and volume. For loose items like rice, dal, or sugar, you’ll generally buy by weight (kgs or grams). But for liquids like oil or milk, you'll buy by volume (liters or milliliters). Sometimes, vendors may try to trick you by using volume measures for items that should be sold by weight, which can result in you getting less for your money.", "normalised": "Another important thing to keep in mind is the difference between weight and volume.
