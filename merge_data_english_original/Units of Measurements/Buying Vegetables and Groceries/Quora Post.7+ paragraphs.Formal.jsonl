{"unnormalised": "The use of units of measurement is fundamental to the process of buying vegetables and groceries in India, ensuring that transactions are standardized, transparent, and fair.

{"unnormalised": "Generally, vegetables and fruits are commonly sold by weight. The kilogram (kg) is the most widely used unit, particularly in urban areas and organized retail settings such as supermarkets and larger grocery stores. You'll frequently see prices displayed as \"Rs. 60/kg for tomatoes\" or \"₹80 per kg for apples\". Smaller quantities are often measured in grams (g), especially for items like spices, herbs, and certain vegetables. For instance, you might buy 250g of coriander leaves or 100g of ginger. At local markets, especially in rural areas, you might encounter older units of weight like the \"seer,\" although its usage is decreasing. Also, the price varies from shop to shop and the farmer's market offers better prices than super markets where you buy the same goods in Rs. 20/20 per Kg.", "normalised": "Generally, vegetables and fruits are commonly sold by weight.

Smaller quantities are often measured in grams (g), especially for items like spices, herbs, and certain vegetables.

At local markets, especially in rural areas, you might encounter older units of weight like the \"seer,\" although its usage is decreasing.

{"unnormalised": "Liquid groceries, such as milk, oil, and ghee, are typically measured by volume. The liter (L) is the standard unit for these products. Milk is almost universally sold in liters, with common packaging sizes including 0.5L and 1L pouches or bottles. Cooking oils are similarly sold, with larger containers often labeled in liters (e.g., 5L cans of sunflower oil). Smaller quantities of specialized oils or ingredients may be sold in milliliters (mL). In many traditional Indian households, the \"pao\" (approximately 250 mL) is still sometimes used informally, particularly when buying milk from local vendors. So, consumers need to be vigilant of volume measurement as well.", "normalised": "Liquid groceries, such as milk, oil, and ghee, are typically measured by volume.

{"unnormalised": "Dry groceries, such as rice, lentils, sugar, and flour, are sold both by weight and, less commonly, by volume. Again, kilograms are the standard unit for larger quantities. You might buy 5kg of rice or 10kg of wheat flour. Smaller quantities are sold in grams, especially in packaged form. For instance, spices are often sold in packets of 50g or 100g. In some regions, volume-based measurements like \"cup\" or \"katori\" may be used informally, especially in smaller transactions or at local markets. But those are non-standard ways of measuring.", "normalised": "Dry groceries, such as rice, lentils, sugar, and flour, are sold both by weight and, less commonly, by volume.

{"unnormalised": "When buying certain items, particularly those sold in bulk or unpackaged, vendors may use scales to measure the quantity. In organized retail, electronic weighing scales are common and are often calibrated to ensure accuracy and compliance with legal metrology standards. At local markets, you may still see traditional balance scales, although digital scales are becoming increasingly prevalent. In either case, it is always a good practice for consumers to verify the accuracy of the scale to ensure they are receiving the correct quantity.", "normalised": "When buying certain items, particularly those sold in bulk or unpackaged, vendors may use scales to measure the quantity.

{"unnormalised": "The choice of measurement unit can also be influenced by regional variations and cultural practices. In some parts of India, you might encounter local units of measurement that are not universally recognized. For example, the \"maund\" (approximately 37 kg) was historically used in some regions, although it is now largely obsolete. Similarly, the \"tola\" (approximately 11.7 grams), traditionally used for precious metals, may occasionally be encountered when buying certain spices or herbs in very small quantities. These traditional units are decreasing in usage due to standardization efforts and the growing influence of modern retail practices.", "normalised": "The choice of measurement unit can also be influenced by regional variations and cultural practices. In some parts of India, you might encounter local units of measurement that are not universally recognized. For example, the \"maund\" (approximately thirty seven k-g) was historically used in some regions, although it is now largely obsolete. Similarly, the \"tola\" (approximately eleven point seven grams), traditionally used for precious metals, may occasionally be encountered when buying certain spices or herbs in very small quantities. These traditional units are decreasing in usage due to standardization efforts and the growing influence of modern retail practices."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the use of standardized units is essential for ensuring fair trade practices and protecting consumers from fraud. The Legal Metrology Act in India mandates the use of standard units of measurement and regulates the calibration and verification of weighing and measuring instruments. This Act helps to ensure that vendors accurately measure and represent the quantity of goods being sold, thereby fostering trust and transparency in transactions. Consumers are encouraged to be aware of their rights and to report any discrepancies or malpractices to the appropriate authorities.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the use of standardized units is essential for ensuring fair trade practices and protecting consumers from fraud.
