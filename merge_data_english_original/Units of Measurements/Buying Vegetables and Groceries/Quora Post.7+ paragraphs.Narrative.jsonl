{"unnormalised": "Then there are the different units they use for different things. Greens like palak or methi are sold by the bunch (gaddi), but what one person considers a “gaddi” can vary wildly. One gaddi can be 100 gms while the other gaddi can be 200 gms. Rice and pulses are sold in kilograms (kg) usually, while some spices are sold in grams. Trying to convert everything in my head on the fly is a workout! I still make mistakes and either end up with way too much of something or have to run back to the store halfway through cooking.
