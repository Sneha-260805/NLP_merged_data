In some places, you might ask for a sher of milk (about nine hundred and thirty three milliliter, though this is getting less common), while in others, it is strictly liters (one liter). Even the definition of a \"small\" or \"large\" size can differ – that \"small\" bag of rice might be two kilograms in one store, and only one point five kilograms in another. Check your bags, folks."}

Simple: be informed and aware. Know your units (one kilogram equals one thousand grams!), compare prices carefully, and do not be afraid to question your vendor if something seems off. Also, learn to eyeball things – with enough practice, you will be able to tell if that \"one kilogram\" bag of potatoes feels suspiciously light! Plus keep a look out for discounts such as ten percent off on two kilograms of sugar and prepone your grocery runs."}
