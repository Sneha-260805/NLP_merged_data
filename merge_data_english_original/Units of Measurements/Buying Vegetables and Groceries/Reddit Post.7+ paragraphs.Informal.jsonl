{"unnormalised": "So, fellow Indians (and anyone else navigating the chaotic world of Indian measurements), am I the only one totally confused by this? Is there some logic to this madness that I'm missing? Are there any other weird weight measurements or units of measurement i should look out for? How does everyone else handle this, especially when you're trying to follow a recipe that uses these units? Any advice or tips for a newbie to the Indian grocery game? Maybe we need a global standard and switch all measurements, it would be so convenient. And why dont they list the prices in per unit metrics? I wish they showed a \"₹ / Kg\" price when trying to decide the quantity to purchase for the amount.", "normalised": "So, fellow Indians (and anyone else navigating the chaotic world of Indian measurements), am I the only one totally confused by this?

{"unnormalised": "Another thing, i noticed when shopping that the weight printed on the packaging does not usually contain decimals, and is rounded to the nearest whole number.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, what's the deal with the plastic bags? They never seem to be strong enough to hold anything, and they charge you ₹5 per bag. Why cant they provide sturdier bags that dont break as soon as you pick them up? Also, what about when buying milk? Its sold by the Liter, but some brands measure differently! Am i the only one experiencing this?", "normalised": "And finally, what's the deal with the plastic bags? They never seem to be strong enough to hold anything, and they charge you rupee five per bag.
