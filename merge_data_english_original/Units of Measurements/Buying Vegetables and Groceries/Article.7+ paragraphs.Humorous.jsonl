{"unnormalised": "Alright folks, let's talk about something near and dear to every Indian's heart (and stomach): buying vegetables. Now, this isn't just a simple \"pick, pay, and peace out\" scenario. Oh no, my friend. It's a delicate dance with units of measurement, a high-stakes negotiation involving grams, kilos, and the occasional bewildered vegetable vendor.", "normalised": "Alright folks, let's talk about something near and dear to every Indian's heart (and stomach): buying vegetables.

{"unnormalised": "It all starts innocently enough. You stroll into the market, visions of a healthy sabzi dancing in your head. You spot some beautiful, bright red tomatoes. \"Bhaiya, how much for these tomatoes?\" you ask, trying to project an air of nonchalance, like you're not desperately trying to figure out the price per kilo in your head. He quotes a price – let's say, ₹60/kg. Now, here's where the fun begins. Do you need 1 kg? Absolutely not. You need exactly enough for your daal and maybe a quick tomato chutney.", "normalised": "It all starts innocently enough. You stroll into the market, visions of a healthy sabzi dancing in your head.

He might even mutter something under his breath about preferring to sell in whole kilos. But fear not! You stand your ground. 250 grams it is! He scoops up a handful of tomatoes, places them on the scale, and… boom! 285 gm. \"Chalta hai?\" he asks with a hopeful look. You sigh inwardly. You know you’re going to end up with more tomatoes than you need, but what can you do? You’re Indian! Bargaining is in your blood, but sometimes, you just gotta surrender to the extra 35 gm.", "normalised": "So, you bravely declare, \"Okay, give me two hundred and fifty gram.\" Now, watch his eyes glaze over for a brief moment.

He scoops up a handful of tomatoes, places them on the scale, and… boom! Two hundred and eighty five gram. \"Chalta hai?\" he asks with a hopeful look. You sigh inwardly.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on trying to buy methi. You want 100 gm for your aloo methi sabzi. The vendor looks at you like you've asked him to calculate the circumference of the Earth. He grabs a massive bunch, chops off a bit (probably more than you need), throws it on the scale, and declares, \"Yeh lo, 150 gm.\" You attempt to reason with him, explaining that you only wanted 100 gm, but he just shrugs and says, \"Thoda zyada se kuch nahi hota. Make extra.\" He's got a point, but your fridge is already overflowing with vegetables from last week’s “250 gm” tomato adventure.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on trying to buy methi.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the eternal question of potatoes and onions. Usually sold together, usually bought in bulk. You ask for \"aadha kilo\" (half a kilo) of each. He piles them on the scale, a chaotic mix of shapes and sizes, like a vegetable jenga tower waiting to collapse. He confidently announces, \"One kilo!\" You raise an eyebrow, questioning his math. He smiles sheepishly and removes a few onions, bringing the total down to 900 gm. Close enough. You give up, pay the man, and trudge home, a triumphant, slightly overwhelmed veggie warrior.", "normalised": "Then there's the eternal question of potatoes and onions.

It's a lesson in approximation, negotiation, and the art of accepting that you will always end up with slightly more (or less) than you intended.
