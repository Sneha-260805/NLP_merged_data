It is never a simple, \"I will take a pound of tomatoes.\" No, no, no. Here, we deal in *kilograms*. And even that is a flexible concept.

It is a gamble, really."}

The answer, my friends, is always \"it depends.\" It depends on the vendor, the day, and probably, the karmic alignment of your chakras. Last week, I swear, my 'bunch' weighed nearly two kilograms! I ended up feeding half the colony *palak paneer*."}

You might get eleven robust, juicy specimens, or thirteen small, slightly bruised ones. The universe is clearly having a laugh at my expense."}

You are buying *toor dal* and you ask for \"two hundred and fifty grams\". Sounds simple, right? Then the vendor pulls out a dusty scale that looks like it was salvaged from a pirate ship and starts piling the *dal* onto it. You watch, mesmerized, as the needle wavers wildly, eventually settling (maybe) around the two hundred and fifty gram mark. You just have to trust the process, or risk questioning the very fabric of reality."}
