{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, Indian households relied heavily on volume-based measurements, particularly when purchasing dry goods like rice, lentils, and spices. Terms like \"a handful\" (a rough estimate of volume, rarely quantified with precision), \"a fistful\" (similarly imprecise), and \"a pinch\" (primarily for spices) were commonplace. While these terms are fading, especially in urban centers, their legacy continues to influence perceptions of quantity and value, sometimes creating discrepancies in consumer expectations. For instance, one might ask for \"thora sa jeera\" (a little cumin) and expect a specific amount based on local norms, potentially leading to misunderstandings with vendors unfamiliar with those norms.", "normalised": "Traditionally, Indian households relied heavily on volume-based measurements, particularly when purchasing dry goods like rice, lentils, and spices.

{"unnormalised": "Weight, conversely, has become the dominant unit of measurement for most vegetables and fruits, particularly in organized retail outlets. Kilograms (kg) and grams (g) are widely understood and employed, though even here, variations persist. The concept of \"ser\" (approximately 933 grams), an older unit of weight, may still be used informally in some rural areas. A customer might ask for “adha ser” (half a ser) of potatoes, requiring the vendor to translate to kilograms for pricing and weighing purposes.", "normalised": "Weight, conversely, has become the dominant unit of measurement for most vegetables and fruits, particularly in organized retail outlets.

{"unnormalised": "The increasing prevalence of packaged goods has further standardized the use of metric measurements. Products are typically labelled with net weights in grams (g) or kilograms (kg), and volumes in milliliters (ml) or liters (l). However, the visual perception of quantity can still influence purchasing decisions. A consumer might choose a 1 kg bag of rice over another, even if the labelled price per kilogram is the same, simply because the bag appears fuller or is packaged more attractively.", "normalised": "The increasing prevalence of packaged goods has further standardized the use of metric measurements.

{"unnormalised": "Pricing strategies often leverage these nuances. For example, a vendor might advertise \"Rs. 20/kg\" for tomatoes but offer smaller quantities at a slightly higher price per unit to cater to customers who only need a limited amount. This price discrimination based on quantity reflects a deep understanding of consumer behavior and their sensitivity to perceived value. Deals such as \"Buy 2 get 1 free\" are often used to move larger quantities of items like biscuit packets listed as \"250 g\".", "normalised": "Pricing strategies often leverage these nuances.

As India continues its journey toward greater economic integration, the interplay between traditional practices and modern standards will undoubtedly shape the future of retail and consumption. A shift from asking for “ek pav” (250g) of peas to “250 grams” reflects this change, although older practices persist especially amongst older generations.", "normalised": "Ultimately, navigating the complexities of units of measurement in the Indian vegetable and grocery market requires cultural awareness, adaptability, and a keen understanding of consumer psychology.
