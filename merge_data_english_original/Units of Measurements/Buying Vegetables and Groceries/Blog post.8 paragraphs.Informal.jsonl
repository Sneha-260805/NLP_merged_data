{"unnormalised": "First things first, forget your fancy digital scales (unless you’re fancy, of course!). In most local markets, you'll find the traditional balance scale. The seller places your veggies on one side, and various weights on the other. These weights are usually in kgs or grams – so get ready to hear things like \"2 kg pyaaz\" (onions) or \"500 gms of adrak\" (ginger).", "normalised": "First things first, forget your fancy digital scales (unless you’re fancy, of course!).

{"unnormalised": "Now, here’s where it gets interesting. You might hear the vendor quoting prices \"per kg\" or even \"per pav.\" What’s a pav, you ask? Well, a 'pav' is essentially 250 gms. So, if tomatoes are Rs. 40/pav, that means they’re costing you Rs. 160 per kilo. Keep those mental calculations sharp! Pro Tip: Always, always, always double-check the balance to make sure you are getting your due kgs and gms.", "normalised": "Now, here’s where it gets interesting. You might hear the vendor quoting prices \"per kilogram\" or even \"per pav.\" What’s a pav, you ask? Well, a 'pav' is essentially two hundred and fifty grams. So, if tomatoes are rupees forty per pav, that means they’re costing you rupees one hundred and sixty per kilo. Keep those mental calculations sharp! Pro Tip: Always, always, always double-check the balance to make sure you are getting your due kilograms and grams."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there are the \"bunches.\" Think spinach (palak), coriander (dhaniya), or methi. These are typically sold by the bunch, not by weight. The size of the bunch can vary wildly. One stall may offer a smaller bunch for ₹20, while another has a massive one for ₹30. Judge it by eye and by feel! Make sure they have not been watered down so that they look bigger.", "normalised": "Then there are the \"bunches.\" Think spinach (palak), coriander (dhaniya), or methi.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the good old \"piece\" or \"number\" system. Corn on the cob (bhutta), lemons (nimbu), bananas (kela), or even single tomatoes are often sold this way. The price is usually quoted per piece (e.g., ₹5 per nimbu). Again, compare between vendors – size and quality can make a big difference. Sometimes vendors sell loose vegetables by ‘dava’ or ‘dhara’ which refers to a set amount of vegetables.", "normalised": "And let's not forget the good old \"piece\" or \"number\" system.

{"unnormalised": "Moving onto groceries - rice, dal, atta, and other staples are mostly sold by the kg. You'll commonly see bags ranging from 1 kg to 25 kgs. Bigger families often buy larger bags of things like atta as they use more. Watch out for \"loose\" items, though. Check the weighing machine carefully to ensure accuracy. Some vendors are known to tamper with them. For example, buying \"2kgs of basmati rice\" may not necessarily mean you get the full weight.", "normalised": "Moving onto groceries - rice, dal, atta, and other staples are mostly sold by the kilogram.

{"unnormalised": "Then you have items that are sold in different units, such as 1 ltr of oil or 500ml of curd. Prices for bottled or packaged food are usually standardized, and they have a Max Retail Price (MRP) printed on them. But at the sabzi mandi, haggling is expected. Don’t be shy to ask for a better price, especially if you're buying in bulk. \"Bhaiya, thoda kam karo na!\" (Brother, reduce the price a bit!) is your mantra.", "normalised": "Then you have items that are sold in different units, such as one liter of oil or five hundred milliliter of curd.
