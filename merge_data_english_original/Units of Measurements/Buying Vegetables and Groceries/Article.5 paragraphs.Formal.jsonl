{"unnormalised": "While the officially mandated system adheres to kilograms (kg) and grams (g) for weight, liters (l) and milliliters (ml) for volume, and meters (m) and centimeters (cm) for length, the informal sector, encompassing a significant portion of vegetable and grocery vendors, frequently employs local units. For instance, vegetables like potatoes and onions may be sold by the \"paav\" (approximately 250g) or the \"ser\" (historically around 933g, though variations exist regionally). Similarly, loose items like spices or pulses are commonly measured using a \"chattak\" (roughly 58g). These units, while deeply ingrained in local customs, present challenges in maintaining consistency and transparency across different markets and regions.", "normalised": "While the officially mandated system adheres to kilograms (k-g) and grams (g) for weight, liters (l) and milliliters (m-l) for volume, and meters (m) and centimeters (c-m) for length, the informal sector, encompassing a significant portion of vegetable and grocery vendors, frequently employs local units. For instance, vegetables like potatoes and onions may be sold by the \"paav\" (approximately two hundred and fifty grams) or the \"ser\" (historically around nine hundred and thirty three grams, though variations exist regionally).

{"unnormalised": "The continued use of these non-standard units stems from several factors. Firstly, habit and familiarity play a crucial role, especially among older generations of vendors and consumers. Secondly, smaller denominations in the metric system may not always be readily available in traditional weighing equipment. For example, accurately measuring small quantities of spices using a standard kilogram scale can be cumbersome. Moreover, the perception of value and affordability often influences the preference for local units. Consumers may perceive a better deal when purchasing a \"paav\" of tomatoes compared to a quarter of a kg, despite the equivalence.", "normalised": "The continued use of these non-standard units stems from several factors.

{"unnormalised": "This reliance on varied measurement systems can lead to inconsistencies in pricing and potential for unfair trade practices. A vendor selling vegetables by the \"ser\" in one market might use a different weight definition compared to another market, creating confusion and potentially exploiting consumers unfamiliar with the local measurement.
