{"unnormalised": "For loose vegetables and fruits, weight is the primary unit. Kilograms (kg) are widely used for larger quantities, like potatoes, onions, and rice. You might ask for \"2 kg aloo\" at your local vendor. Grams (g) are used for smaller quantities of spices, herbs, and more expensive items like cashew nuts or saffron. \"50g haldi\" is a common request. Prices are generally quoted per kg or per 100g, allowing consumers to compare costs effectively. Remember that some vendors might still use tola, especially older ones, where 1 tola is approximately 11.66 grams, but this is decreasingly common.", "normalised": "For loose vegetables and fruits, weight is the primary unit.
