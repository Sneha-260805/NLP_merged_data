You might ask for \"one kilogram of potatoes\" or \"five hundred grams of tomatoes\". \"Grams\" (g-m-s) is a smaller unit, where one thousand grams make one kilogram. But, be careful! Some older vendors might still use \"seer,\" a traditional unit roughly equivalent to nine hundred and thirty three grams. A \"pao\" is generally two hundred and fifty grams, which is one divided by four of a kilo, used more for smaller quantities."}

A \"pao\" is generally 250 g, which is 1/4 of a kilo, used more for smaller quantities.", "normalised": "Volume is another essential aspect, especially when buying liquids or items like lentils and rice in bulk. For milk or oil, you'll typically use \"liters\" (l). So, you might ask for \"two liters of milk\". Smaller quantities might be measured in \"milliliters\" (m-l), where one thousand milliliters equals one liter. But, again, be aware of variations! Some shops might still use measures like \"adholi\" for grains, though these are becoming less common, it holds approximately two kilograms of rice in some regions."}

When buying leafy greens like spinach (palak) or coriander (dhaniya), you'll often hear vendors selling by the \"bunch\" or \"gaddi\". The size of a \"bunch\" can vary, so it’s a good idea to visually compare bunches before buying. Sometimes, you might see a \"dheri,\" which is a small heap of something like chilies or ginger. The weight of a dheri can range from fifty grams to one hundred grams, depending on the vendor."}

Often, you'll see price tags like \"rupees sixty per kilogram\" or \"rupee forty per pao\". This means Rupees sixty per kilogram or Rupees forty per quarter kilogram (two hundred and fifty grams). Always double-check the price per unit before confirming your purchase. Don't hesitate to ask the vendor if they are charging \"rupees ten each\" for lemons, or if that's the price for \"half kilogram\". Also, note that prices may fluctuate depending on the season and the local mandi rates. Always try to buy from vendors who display prices clearly to avoid confusion."}
