The vendor will load it up, declare, “Ek kilo!” (One kilo!) and you're like, \"Okay, looks about right.\" Except, you get home, put it on your fancy digital scale, and it's only 900 gm.

Plus, where else can you get a lecture on the nutritional benefits of *lauki* while simultaneously trying to decipher a rusty old weight?
