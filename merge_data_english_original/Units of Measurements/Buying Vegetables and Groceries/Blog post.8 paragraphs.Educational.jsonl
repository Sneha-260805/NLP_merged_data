{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. When you go to the local sabzi mandi (vegetable market), you'll often hear vendors quoting prices per kg, which is short for kilogram. 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams (gm). So, if potatoes are ₹40/kg, you're essentially paying ₹0.04 per gm. Keep this in mind when comparing prices at different shops. Sometimes, smaller shops might quote per 1/2 kg, so quickly doubling that price gives you the cost per kg for easy comparison. Also, you might see vendors using \"paav\" which is 250 gms (or 1/4 kg).", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to vegetables sold in bunches, like spinach (palak) or coriander (dhaniya). Here, the measurement is less standardized. A \"bunch\" can vary significantly in size, from a small handful to a substantial bundle. It's always a good idea to visually inspect the bunch and ask for a rough weight estimate. For example, you can ask, \"Bhaiya, yeh palak ka gaddi kitne grams ka hai?\" (Brother, how many grams is this bunch of spinach?). Most vendors will give you a reasonable estimate. You can then compare the cost per estimated gram to other vendors.", "normalised": "Moving on to vegetables sold in bunches, like spinach (palak) or coriander (dhaniya).

{"unnormalised": "For fruits, things can be a bit more straightforward. You'll typically encounter prices quoted per piece for individual fruits like apples, oranges, or bananas. But bigger fruits like watermelons are priced per kg, similarly to vegetables. The size of the fruit will influence the overall weight, and therefore the price, so always gauge the size before committing to buying.", "normalised": "For fruits, things can be a bit more straightforward.

{"unnormalised": "When it comes to dry groceries, like rice, lentils (dal), or sugar, most shops use kg or gm. You might also encounter older units of measurement, particularly in smaller towns or villages. For instance, you might hear terms like \"ser\" or \"chatak,\" which are traditional Indian units of weight. 1 ser is approximately equal to 933 grams, while 1 chatak is about 58 grams. These are less common now, but it's good to be aware of them, especially if you're shopping in rural areas.", "normalised": "When it comes to dry groceries, like rice, lentils (dal), or sugar, most shops use kilogram or g-m.

{"unnormalised": "Packaged goods will almost always display the weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Pay attention to the 'net weight', which indicates the weight of the product alone, excluding the packaging. You might also see abbreviations like \"mg\" for milligrams, which is 1/1000th of a gram. For liquids, like oil, you'll see measurements in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). 1 L is equal to 1000 mL.", "normalised": "Packaged goods will almost always display the weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).
