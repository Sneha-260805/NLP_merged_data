{"unnormalised": "One of the most common units you'll encounter is the \"kilo,\" short for kilogram. Most vendors use digital weighing scales that display the weight in kilograms (kg) and grams (g). You might ask for \"1 kg of potatoes\" or \"500 g of tomatoes.\" Understanding that 1 kg equals 1000 g is crucial. Sometimes, vendors, especially in smaller towns, might use older, less precise balance scales. Always double-check the reading to ensure accuracy.", "normalised": "One of the most common units you will encounter is the \"kilo,\" short for kilogram. Most vendors use digital weighing scales that display the weight in kilograms (K-G) and grams (G). You might ask for \"one kilogram of potatoes\" or \"five hundred grams of tomatoes.\" Understanding that one kilogram equals one thousand grams is crucial. Sometimes, vendors, especially in smaller towns, might use older, less precise balance scales. Always double-check the reading to ensure accuracy."}
{"unnormalised": "Another unit you might encounter, especially in rural areas or when buying in bulk, is the \"seer.\" While its exact weight varies regionally, it generally hovers around 933 grams. For example, if a farmer is selling potatoes in seers, asking for \"1 seer\" will get you approximately 933 g of potatoes. Keep in mind that the weight can vary based on region, so it’s worth asking the vendor the exact equivalent if you're unsure.", "normalised": "Another unit you might encounter, especially in rural areas or when buying in bulk, is the \"seer.\" While its exact weight varies regionally, it generally hovers around nine hundred and thirty three grams. For example, if a farmer is selling potatoes in seers, asking for \"one seer\" will get you approximately nine hundred and thirty three grams of potatoes. Keep in mind that the weight can vary based on region, so it is worth asking the vendor the exact equivalent if you are unsure."}
{"unnormalised": "For leafy greens like spinach or coriander, vendors often sell in \"bundles\" or \"gaddis.\" These aren't standardized units and the quantity can vary significantly. A \"gaddi\" of spinach might weigh anywhere from 200 g to 500 g, depending on the vendor and the season. It's best to visually assess the size of the bundle and negotiate the price accordingly. Sometimes, you can ask for a specific weight, like \"Rs. 20 worth of spinach,\" which translates to a certain weight.", "normalised": "For leafy greens like spinach or coriander, vendors often sell in \"bundles\" or \"gaddis.\" These are not standardized units and the quantity can vary significantly.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the concept of volume, particularly relevant for liquids like oil or milk. While pre-packaged items use liters (L) and milliliters (mL), loose oil or milk sold at local dairies or smaller shops might be measured in \"pauas\" or \"adulis.\" A \"paua\" generally refers to 250 mL, while an \"aduli\" is approximately 500 mL. So, if you ask for \"1 aduli of milk,\" you'll receive roughly 0.5 L. Be aware that the accuracy of these measures can vary, especially with older measuring vessels.", "normalised": "Then there is the concept of volume, particularly relevant for liquids like oil or milk. While pre-packaged items use liters (L) and milliliters (M-L), loose oil or milk sold at local dairies or smaller shops might be measured in \"pauas\" or \"adulis.\" A \"paua\" generally refers to two hundred and fifty milliliters, while an \"aduli\" is approximately five hundred milliliters. So, if you ask for \"one aduli of milk,\" you will receive roughly zero point five liters. Be aware that the accuracy of these measures can vary, especially with older measuring vessels."}
{"unnormalised": "When buying grains or pulses, you might encounter terms like \"maund\" or \"kuncham,\" though these are becoming less common in urban areas. A \"maund\" is a traditional unit of weight, equivalent to approximately 37.32 kg. A \"kuncham\" is smaller, often around 5 kg. These units are more prevalent when dealing with large quantities directly from farmers or wholesalers.", "normalised": "When buying grains or pulses, you might encounter terms like \"maund\" or \"kuncham,\" though these are becoming less common in urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Remember the importance of haggling and visual inspection. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on the quantity, especially when dealing with non-standardized units. Visual inspection is key for produce - check for freshness and quality before agreeing to a price. Also, compare prices across different vendors to ensure you're getting a fair deal, especially when you're buying 250g or 100g of something and the vendor tries to round up.", "normalised": "Remember the importance of haggling and visual inspection.
