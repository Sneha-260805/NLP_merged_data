{"unnormalised": "Traditionally, measurements in local markets often rely on approximations and visual estimations. A vendor might loosely weigh out \"1/2 kg\" of tomatoes, relying on a handheld scale that may not always be precisely calibrated. Similarly, leafy greens like spinach or fenugreek are often sold in \"bundles,\" where the weight can vary significantly depending on the vendor and the season. This informal system, while convenient, introduces potential for inconsistencies and disputes, especially when dealing with customers who demand exactness. The stated size might be inaccurate or poorly communicated leading to customer disappointment.", "normalised": "Traditionally, measurements in local markets often rely on approximations and visual estimations.

{"unnormalised": "Modern retail outlets aim to provide greater standardization and accuracy. Packaged goods are meticulously labeled with their net weight or volume, adhering to legal metrology standards. A packet of biscuits will clearly state \"Net Weight: 100g,\" while a bottle of cooking oil will indicate \"Volume: 1L.\" This transparency empowers consumers to make informed decisions and compare prices effectively. Moreover, the widespread adoption of electronic weighing scales, capable of displaying measurements to the nearest gram, has further enhanced the reliability of transactions. Still, challenges remain when it comes to fresh produce.", "normalised": "Modern retail outlets aim to provide greater standardization and accuracy.

{"unnormalised": "However, even in organized retail, unnormalized practices persist. Consider the purchase of loose vegetables. A customer might ask for \"250 gm\" of onions, and the cashier will typically record this in the system without conversion to kilograms. This practice, though seemingly trivial, highlights the coexistence of both metric and informal measurement habits. Furthermore, promotional offers might state \"Buy 2 get 50% off,\" without explicitly mentioning the quantity or weight associated with the offer, leading to potential ambiguity.", "normalised": "However, even in organized retail, unnormalized practices persist.

{"unnormalised": "The use of regional units adds another layer of complexity. In some parts of India, particularly rural areas, traditional units such as \"ser\" or \"tolas\" may still be prevalent. While these units are gradually being phased out in favor of metric units, their lingering presence can create confusion and impede seamless transactions. For instance, a farmer might quote the price of grains per \"quintal\" (100 kg), whereas a local retailer might prefer to deal in smaller quantities measured in kilograms. This discrepancy necessitates constant conversion, adding to the cognitive load for both buyers and sellers.", "normalised": "The use of regional units adds another layer of complexity.
