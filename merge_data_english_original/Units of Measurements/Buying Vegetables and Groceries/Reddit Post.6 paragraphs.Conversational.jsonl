{"unnormalised": "Like, take this tomato fertilizer recipe. It calls for 2 cups of Epsom salt. Okay, cool, but how much is that in grams? My kitchen scale only shows weight in grams and kgs. I saw some online converters showing like 473 ml approx which is equal to 2 cups but I am not sure about the conversions I see. Same with water - some recipes say \"1 gallon,\" but I don't have a gallon container. I usually buy water in 20-liter cans. Is there any standard conversation so I could go ahead?", "normalised": "Like, take this tomato fertilizer recipe. It calls for two cups of Epsom salt. Okay, cool, but how much is that in grams?

{"unnormalised": "What really gets me is the inconsistent units for things like compost. One place sells it by the kg, another by the cubic ft. How does one even compare the value for money?
