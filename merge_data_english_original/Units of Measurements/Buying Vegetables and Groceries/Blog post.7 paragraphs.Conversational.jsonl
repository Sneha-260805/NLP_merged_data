So, if you need roughly 1kg of potatoes, ask for \"char bags, bhaiya.\" Also, many vendors still use the \"tola\" system for spices. Find out what 1 tola equals in grams (it's usually around 11.66g, but ask around!), and you'll be a spice-buying pro.", "normalised": "I’ve learned a few tricks over the years.

A little bit of gyan about \"pao\" versus \"kg\" and \"ml\" versus \"liter\" can go a long way in making your shopping experience a bit smoother.
