{"unnormalised": "In several markets, vegetables like potatoes and onions are commonly sold in \"pao\" (250 gm) or \"adha kilo\" (500 gm) increments, but a “pao” can sometimes be 200 gm or 300 gm depending on the vendor and the buyer's negotiating skills, deviating from the standard. This informal measurement system is especially confusing for new residents and tourists. The study also revealed that pre-packaged groceries often have \"net weight\" markings that don’t accurately reflect the contents, with some packages found to be underweight by as much as 50 grams.", "normalised": "In several markets, vegetables like potatoes and onions are commonly sold in \"pao\" (two hundred and fifty gram) or \"adha kilo\" (five hundred gram) increments, but a “pao” can sometimes be two hundred gram or three hundred gram depending on the vendor and the buyer's negotiating skills, deviating from the standard.

{"unnormalised": "Supermarkets, while generally more reliable, aren't entirely free of discrepancies. Some stores round up the weight of produce significantly, for instance, charging for 1.1 kg when the actual weight is 1.05 kg. This may seem insignificant for individual purchases but adds up over time for regular shoppers. Furthermore, the survey exposed instances of tampered weighing scales, where vendors deliberately alter the readings to overcharge customers. These fraudulent practices often target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those less familiar with local market customs.", "normalised": "Supermarkets, while generally more reliable, aren't entirely free of discrepancies.
