{"unnormalised": "The cornerstone of measuring mass in the Indian grocery landscape is the kilogram (kg). From dal to sugar, most staple items are sold in units of kg, or its subunit, the gram (g). It’s not uncommon to find vendors using abbreviations like \"gm\" interchangeably with \"g\", which, while not strictly adhering to SI units, is widely understood. A savvy shopper should be comfortable converting between these two: 1 kg equals 1000 g or 1000 gm.", "normalised": "The cornerstone of measuring mass in the Indian grocery landscape is the kilogram (k-g). From dal to sugar, most staple items are sold in units of k-g, or its subunit, the gram (g). It’s not uncommon to find vendors using abbreviations like \"g-m\" interchangeably with \"g\", which, while not strictly adhering to S-I units, is widely understood. A savvy shopper should be comfortable converting between these two: one k-g equals one thousand g or one thousand g-m."}
{"unnormalised": "Liquids, such as milk, oil, and juices, are typically measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). A 1 L bottle of milk is a common sight in Indian households. Understanding that 1 L is equivalent to 1000 mL is vital when comparing prices and quantities. One might, for instance, encounter smaller sachets of oil labelled as 200 ml.", "normalised": "Liquids, such as milk, oil, and juices, are typically measured in liters (L) or milliliters (m-L).

{"unnormalised": "Fresh produce often presents its own set of measurement practices. While some vegetables and fruits are sold by weight (kg or g), others are sold by count. Bananas might be sold by the dozen, or individual lemons might be priced per piece. Familiarity with local customs is key here, as practices can vary across different regions and markets.", "normalised": "Fresh produce often presents its own set of measurement practices.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the \"packet\" or \"bottle\" serve as informal, volume-based units of measurement for pre-packaged products. Often the packaging will display the weight or volume of the product in standard units (g, kg, ml, L), but the \"packet\" or \"bottle\" itself, is often used in informal discussion: \"I bought two packets of biscuits yesterday.\"", "normalised": "Furthermore, the \"packet\" or \"bottle\" serve as informal, volume-based units of measurement for pre-packaged products.

{"unnormalised": "Price is, of course, inextricably linked to measurement. Prices are typically quoted per unit of measurement – rupees (Rs.) per kg, Rs. per L, or Rs. per piece. Careful attention to these details is crucial for comparing prices across different vendors and ensuring value for money. For example, one vendor might sell potatoes at Rs. 30/kg, while another offers them at Rs. 16/500g; calculating the equivalent price per kg enables an informed choice.", "normalised": "Price is, of course, inextricably linked to measurement. Prices are typically quoted per unit of measurement – rupees (R-s) per k-g, R-s per L, or R-s per piece. Careful attention to these details is crucial for comparing prices across different vendors and ensuring value for money. For example, one vendor might sell potatoes at rupees thirty per k-g, while another offers them at rupees sixteen per five hundred g; calculating the equivalent price per k-g enables an informed choice."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the basics, awareness of specific product-related measurement conventions is also helpful. For example, rice is often sold in large sacks, weighing 25 kg or 50 kg. Flour (atta) commonly comes in bags of 5 kg or 10 kg. Understanding these common sizes allows consumers to plan their purchases accordingly.", "normalised": "Beyond the basics, awareness of specific product-related measurement conventions is also helpful.
