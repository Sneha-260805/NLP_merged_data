Usually sold by the kilogram, right? But sometimes the vendor's weighing scale is a bit wonky, and he might say \"Ek kilo mein eight hundred grams hai, chalega?\" (There are eight hundred grams in one kilo, is that okay?). Knowing that one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams helps you quickly decide if you are getting a fair deal. Remember that conversion."}

Usually sold by the bunch. But what if you are making saag paneer and the recipe calls for \"two hundred and fifty grams of spinach\"? Time to estimate!
