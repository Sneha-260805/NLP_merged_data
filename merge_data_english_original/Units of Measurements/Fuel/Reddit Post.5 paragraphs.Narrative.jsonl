{"unnormalised": "Anyway, after pushing the bike for what felt like 5 km (the actual distance was probably closer to 2 km, according to Google Maps), I finally found a petrol pump. I asked the attendant to fill it up completely. He started pumping, and I watched as the numbers climbed. The tank took in 11.75 liters of petrol! I was shocked because I knew the fuel tank capacity of my Bajaj Pulsar 150 is supposed to be around 15 litres.

{"unnormalised": "Turns out, I had a small leak in the fuel line. The mechanic at the service station confirmed it. He said it was probably losing a few milliliters every few seconds while riding. Small enough to miss, but over the 200+ km I clock every week, it added up! He fixed it, and now hopefully I'm back to a respectable fuel consumption.", "normalised": "Turns out, I had a small leak in the fuel line. The mechanic at the service station confirmed it.

And keep a close eye on your mileage, especially if you're burning fuel faster than usual.
