I remember my uncle, Sharma ji, would boast his old Maruti 800 gave him 25 kmpl (kilometers per liter) in the city. Of course, this was achieved by driving at a steady 40 km/h (kilometers per hour), windows up, AC off (even in Delhi summer at 40 deg C), and drafting behind DTC buses. Efficiency at its finest (or torture, depending on your perspective).", "normalised": "We Indians, masters of Jugaad, have perfected the art of stretching every drop of petrol to its absolute limit.
