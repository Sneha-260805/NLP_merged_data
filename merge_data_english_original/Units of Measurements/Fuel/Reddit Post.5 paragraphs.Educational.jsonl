{"unnormalised": "Basically, \"kmpl\" is kilometers per liter. So, if your car gives 20 kmpl, it means you can drive 20 kilometers using 1 liter of fuel. Seems simple enough, right? But there's more to it. That \"20 kmpl\" figure you see is often under ideal conditions, like a smooth highway with consistent speed. City driving, with all the starts and stops, will drastically reduce that. You might get closer to \"12-15 kmpl\" in a city like Bangalore because of all the traffic jams. Also, fuel efficiency varies depending on whether you are measuring \"Mileage\" or \"Average Fuel Consumption\" both can be measured in kmpl.", "normalised": "basically, \"kilometer per liter\" is kilometers per liter. so, if your car gives twenty kilometer per liter, it means you can drive twenty kilometers using one liter of fuel. seems simple enough, right? but there's more to it. that \"twenty kilometer per liter\" figure you see is often under ideal conditions, like a smooth highway with consistent speed. city driving, with all the starts and stops, will drastically reduce that. you might get closer to \"twelve to fifteen kilometer per liter\" in a city like Bangalore because of all the traffic jams. also, fuel efficiency varies depending on whether you are measuring \"mileage\" or \"average fuel consumption\" both can be measured in kilometer per liter."}
{"unnormalised": "Another thing to consider is the unit itself. While kmpl is standard in India, some other countries use \"miles per gallon (mpg).\" To convert from kmpl to mpg, you can use the conversion factor: 1 kmpl is roughly equivalent to 2.35 mpg. So, a car giving 20 kmpl is giving about 47 mpg. Helpful if you're comparing cars internationally! You could also use \"liters per 100 km\" (L/100km). If your car gives 20 kmpl, that's the same as saying it consumes 5L/100km (because 100/20 = 5).", "normalised": "another thing to consider is the unit itself. while kilometer per liter is standard in India, some other countries use \"miles per gallon (M-P-G).\" to convert from kilometer per liter to M-P-G, you can use the conversion factor: one kilometer per liter is roughly equivalent to two point three five M-P-G. so, a car giving twenty kilometer per liter is giving about forty seven M-P-G. helpful if you're comparing cars internationally! you could also use \"liters per one hundred kilometer\" (L slash one hundred kilometer). if your car gives twenty kilometer per liter, that's the same as saying it consumes five L slash one hundred kilometer (because one hundred divided by twenty equals five)."}
{"unnormalised": "Also, don't forget fuel costs! Right now, petrol is around \"₹100 per liter\" (prices fluctuate, of course). So, if you drive 100 km and your car gives 20 kmpl, you'll use 5 liters of petrol, costing you ₹500. Compare that to a car giving only 10 kmpl, and you'll use 10 liters costing you ₹1000.
