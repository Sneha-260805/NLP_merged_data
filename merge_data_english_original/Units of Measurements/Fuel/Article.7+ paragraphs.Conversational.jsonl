{"unnormalised": "I remember when petrol used to be, like, Rs. 50 a litre. Now, you're staring at a price tag closer to ₹100 per L, depending on where you are. Delhi might be a bit cheaper than Chennai, and some states have those extra taxes that make your wallet weep a little extra. It’s enough to make you consider switching to an electric scooter, but then you remember the charging time, the initial cost of the scooter, and the nagging range anxiety of whether you can actually make it back home on a single charge.

My car barely manages 15 km/l in the city, stop-start traffic and all. And the sales guy when I bought it promised me 20! That was probably when he was driving downhill with the wind behind him.
