{"unnormalised": "The basic unit of fuel volume is the litre (L). In India, petrol pumps dispense fuel in litres. You might fill your car with 40 L of petrol or your scooter with 5 L. But understanding just the volume isn't enough; we also need to consider the energy content. Different fuels have different energy densities, meaning a litre of one fuel might provide more power than a litre of another. For example, 1 L of diesel typically yields more energy than 1 L of petrol.", "normalised": "The basic unit of fuel volume is the liter (L). In India, petrol pumps dispense fuel in liters.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel consumption is often expressed as kilometres per litre (km/L). This metric tells you how far a vehicle can travel on one litre of fuel. A car with a fuel efficiency of 20 km/L can travel 20 kilometres on 1 litre of petrol. This is a common way to compare the efficiency of different vehicles. Smaller cars and scooters often boast higher km/L figures compared to larger SUVs. Factors such as driving habits, road conditions, and vehicle maintenance significantly impact km/L. Aggressive acceleration and braking, driving in congested areas, and neglecting regular servicing can all reduce fuel efficiency.", "normalised": "Fuel consumption is often expressed as kilometers per liter (kilometer/L). This metric tells you how far a vehicle can travel on one liter of fuel. A car with a fuel efficiency of twenty kilometer/L can travel twenty kilometers on one liter of petrol. This is a common way to compare the efficiency of different vehicles. Smaller cars and scooters often boast higher kilometer/L figures compared to larger S-U-V's. Factors such as driving habits, road conditions, and vehicle maintenance significantly impact kilometer/L. Aggressive acceleration and braking, driving in congested areas, and neglecting regular servicing can all reduce fuel efficiency."}
{"unnormalised": "Another unit, less common in everyday use but important in scientific and engineering contexts, is the British Thermal Unit (BTU). 1 BTU is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. Fuel energy content can be expressed in BTU per gallon or BTU per cubic foot. This is more frequently used when discussing the energy content of natural gas or other fuels used for heating and power generation. For example, natural gas might be rated at 1,000 BTU per cubic foot.", "normalised": "Another unit, less common in everyday use but important in scientific and engineering contexts, is the British Thermal Unit (B-T-U). One B-T-U is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Fuel energy content can be expressed in B-T-U per gallon or B-T-U per cubic foot. This is more frequently used when discussing the energy content of natural gas or other fuels used for heating and power generation. For example, natural gas might be rated at one thousand B-T-U per cubic foot."}
{"unnormalised": "In the context of aviation, fuel consumption is sometimes expressed in gallons per hour (GPH) or litres per hour (L/hr). This indicates the rate at which an aircraft consumes fuel during flight. A commercial airliner might burn thousands of litres of fuel per hour during a long-haul flight. An even less commonly used (but still technically correct) unit is barrels per day (bbl/d), typically when discussing crude oil production or refining capacity. A large refinery might process hundreds of thousands of bbl/d.", "normalised": "In the context of aviation, fuel consumption is sometimes expressed in gallons per hour (G-P-H) or liters per hour (L/hour).

{"unnormalised": "The price of fuel is typically quoted in Rupees per litre (Rs/L). Fuel prices fluctuate based on international crude oil prices, government taxes, and local market conditions. For example, petrol might cost Rs. 105/L in Delhi one day and Rs. 110/L the next, depending on market dynamics. Being mindful of fuel efficiency and adopting fuel-saving practices can help reduce your fuel expenses, especially given these fluctuating prices.", "normalised": "The price of fuel is typically quoted in Rupees per liter (Rupees/L).
