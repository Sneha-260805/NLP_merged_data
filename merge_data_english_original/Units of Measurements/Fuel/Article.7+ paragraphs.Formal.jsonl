{"unnormalised": "The primary unit of measurement for liquid fuels like petrol and diesel in India is the litre (L). This metric unit is universally recognized and serves as the standard for retail transactions at petrol pumps across the country. Consumers purchase fuel based on litres, and prices are prominently displayed per litre. Government regulations and taxation policies also heavily rely on the litre as the fundamental unit for fuel volume. For instance, excise duty is often levied at a specific rate per litre of fuel.", "normalised": "The primary unit of measurement for liquid fuels like petrol and diesel in India is the litre (L).

{"unnormalised": "However, while the litre is the everyday unit, the fuel industry employs additional units for various purposes, including bulk transportation, storage, and refining processes. One such unit is the kilolitre (kL), which is equivalent to 1,000 litres. Kilolitres are frequently used when discussing the capacity of storage tanks at refineries and fuel depots. Reports regarding fuel production and consumption at a national level often cite figures in kilolitres to provide a more manageable scale.", "normalised": "However, while the litre is the everyday unit, the fuel industry employs additional units for various purposes, including bulk transportation, storage, and refining processes.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the fuel industry also employs units of mass, particularly kilograms (kg), and tonnes (t). While litres are convenient for volumetric measurements, mass units are essential for accounting for the density variations in different fuel types and grades. Density, typically measured in kg/L, reflects the mass of fuel contained within a specific volume. A fuel with a higher density will have a greater mass per litre compared to a fuel with a lower density.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the fuel industry also employs units of mass, particularly kilograms (kg), and tonnes (t).

{"unnormalised": "The density of petrol typically ranges from 0.72 to 0.77 kg/L, while diesel density falls within the range of 0.82 to 0.85 kg/L. These density variations are influenced by factors such as the composition of crude oil, refining processes, and the addition of additives. When transporting fuel in large quantities, such as by tankers or pipelines, the volume is often converted to mass using density values for accurate accounting. A tanker with 20 kL of diesel would thus carry approximately 16.4 tonnes (20,000 L * 0.82 kg/L = 16,400 kg = 16.4 t).", "normalised": "The density of petrol typically ranges from zero point seven two to zero point seven seven kilogram per litre, while diesel density falls within the range of zero point eight two to zero point eight five kilogram per litre. These density variations are influenced by factors such as the composition of crude oil, refining processes, and the addition of additives. When transporting fuel in large quantities, such as by tankers or pipelines, the volume is often converted to mass using density values for accurate accounting. A tanker with twenty kilolitres of diesel would thus carry approximately sixteen point four tonnes (twenty thousand litres multiplied by zero point eight two kilogram per litre equals sixteen thousand four hundred kilograms equals sixteen point four tonnes)."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the standard units, specialized units are used in specific contexts. The petroleum industry often references barrels (bbl) of crude oil. While not directly applicable to retail fuel sales in India, understanding the barrel's relevance is essential, as it forms the foundation of global crude oil pricing. One barrel is approximately equivalent to 159 litres. Therefore, fluctuations in crude oil prices, quoted in USD/bbl, indirectly impact the price of petrol and diesel at Indian fuel pumps, given that India imports a significant portion of its crude oil requirements.", "normalised": "Beyond the standard units, specialized units are used in specific contexts.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, while the litre is the primary unit of measurement encountered by Indian consumers at petrol pumps, a broader understanding of units like the kilolitre, kilogram, tonne, and barrel is crucial for gaining a comprehensive perspective on the fuel industry's operations, pricing dynamics, and the impact of global market forces. Awareness of these units and their interrelation empowers consumers and policymakers alike to engage in more informed discussions regarding fuel costs, energy security, and sustainable practices.", "normalised": "In conclusion, while the litre is the primary unit of measurement encountered by Indian consumers at petrol pumps, a broader understanding of units like the kilolitre, kilogram, tonne, and barrel is crucial for gaining a comprehensive perspective on the fuel industry's operations, pricing dynamics, and the impact of global market forces.
