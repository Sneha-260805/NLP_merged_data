{"unnormalised": "Historically, fuel measurements in India have been characterized by regional variations and traditional units. In many rural areas, fuel, particularly firewood and kerosene, might still be measured in localized units such as *bhar* (a headload) or *ser* (a traditional weight measure). These units, though deeply ingrained in local commerce, lack the precision required for large-scale transactions and can lead to discrepancies.", "normalised": "Historically, fuel measurements in India have been characterized by regional variations and traditional units.

Petrol bunks (gas stations) across the country operate on this metric, displaying prices and dispensing fuel in liters. The precision of these dispensers is regulated by the Department of Legal Metrology, ensuring accuracy and preventing fraud. Octane rating, a performance measure of gasoline, is also a critical element; fuels may be referred to as \"Octane 91\" or \"RON91\" indicating Research Octane Number, another important measurement.", "normalised": "However, the formal and standardized unit for measuring liquid fuels like petrol and diesel is the **liter (L)**.

{"unnormalised": "The measurement of gaseous fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), presents a different set of challenges. CNG is typically measured in **kilograms (kg)** or **cubic meters (m³)**, while LPG, used predominantly for domestic cooking, is also sold by weight in kilograms (kg). The energy content of these fuels is often expressed in **British Thermal Units (BTUs)** or **kilojoules (kJ)** per unit volume or mass, allowing for comparisons between different types of gaseous fuels.", "normalised": "The measurement of gaseous fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (C-N-G) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L-P-G), presents a different set of challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The pricing of fuel in India is a complex interplay of international crude oil prices, refining costs, taxes, and transportation expenses. These factors contribute to the final price displayed at petrol pumps, which are prominently displayed in Rupees per liter (Rs/L). Fluctuations in global oil prices directly impact domestic fuel prices, making fuel measurement a critical aspect of economic forecasting and policy making.", "normalised": "The pricing of fuel in India is a complex interplay of international crude oil prices, refining costs, taxes, and transportation expenses.

{"unnormalised": "Environmental considerations are also shaping the way fuel is measured and used. As India transitions towards cleaner fuels, the measurement of emissions becomes increasingly important. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are often expressed in kilograms (kg) or tonnes (t) per unit of fuel consumed, providing a benchmark for assessing the environmental impact of different fuels. Regulatory bodies like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) play a crucial role in monitoring and enforcing emission standards. The density of various fuels, often measured in **kg/m3**, is an important property for emission calculations and storage considerations.", "normalised": "Environmental considerations are also shaping the way fuel is measured and used.
