{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, how does everyone keep track of fuel efficiency? I used to obsess over the mileage – you know, kmpl (kilometres per litre). My old Bajaj scooter, the legendary Chetaks used to give somewhere around 40 kmpl, now its 30 kmpl i guess. Felt like a champion when I squeezed out an extra 0.5 kmpl just by coasting downhill! Those were simpler times, right? Pre-BS6 engines and all that jazz.", "normalised": "Seriously though, how does everyone keep track of fuel efficiency?

{"unnormalised": "The worst part is trying to estimate how much fuel I need for a road trip. Like, I'm planning a drive from Bangalore to Goa next month. Google Maps says it's roughly 600 km. So, if my car gives me, say, 15 kmpl (optimistically!), I'll need about 40 liters of petrol, right? But then you gotta factor in traffic, AC usage, and my heavy foot on the accelerator.
