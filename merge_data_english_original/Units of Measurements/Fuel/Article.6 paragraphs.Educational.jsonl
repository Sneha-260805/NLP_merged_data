{"unnormalised": "Fuel efficiency is a major concern for vehicle owners in India, especially with fluctuating petrol prices. Understanding how fuel consumption is measured is crucial for making informed decisions. Typically, we see mileage figures quoted in kmpl or 'kilometres per litre', which indicates how many kilometres a vehicle can travel on 1 litre of fuel. Some older vehicles may still use the miles per gallon (mpg) system, but kmpl is the standard in India.", "normalised": "fuel efficiency is a major concern for vehicle owners in India, especially with fluctuating petrol prices. understanding how fuel consumption is measured is crucial for making informed decisions. typically, we see mileage figures quoted in kilometer per litre or 'kilometers per litre', which indicates how many kilometers a vehicle can travel on one liter of fuel. some older vehicles may still use the miles per gallon (M-P-G) system, but kilometer per litre is the standard in India."}
{"unnormalised": "For example, if a car has a mileage of 20 kmpl, it means it can travel 20 km on 1 litre of petrol or diesel. This figure is often obtained under ideal test conditions, so real-world fuel efficiency can differ. It is influenced by several factors, like driving habits, traffic conditions, and vehicle maintenance. Always remember to compare kmpl figures within similar vehicle categories, like comparing the kmpl of hatchbacks vs. sedans.", "normalised": "for example, if a car has a mileage of twenty kilometer per litre, it means it can travel twenty kilometer on one liter of petrol or diesel. this figure is often obtained under ideal test conditions, so real-world fuel efficiency can differ. it is influenced by several factors, like driving habits, traffic conditions, and vehicle maintenance. always remember to compare kilometer per litre figures within similar vehicle categories, like comparing the kilometer per litre of hatchbacks versus sedans."}
{"unnormalised": "Another important unit is the 'litre per 100 km' (L/100km). This measurement tells us how many litres of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel 100 kilometers. A lower L/100km figure indicates better fuel efficiency. For instance, a car that consumes 5 L/100km is more fuel-efficient than one consuming 8 L/100km. This measurement is commonly used in Europe and is gaining popularity in some segments in India too.", "normalised": "another important unit is the 'liter per one hundred kilometer' (L slash one hundred kilometer). this measurement tells us how many liters of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel one hundred kilometers. a lower L slash one hundred kilometer figure indicates better fuel efficiency. for instance, a car that consumes five L slash one hundred kilometer is more fuel-efficient than one consuming eight L slash one hundred kilometer. this measurement is commonly used in Europe and is gaining popularity in some segments in India too."}
{"unnormalised": "When considering different fuels, like CNG or LPG, the measurement units may vary. CNG is often measured in 'kilograms', so the mileage may be expressed in 'km per kg' (km/kg). LPG is usually measured in litres, similar to petrol and diesel. For electric vehicles, fuel efficiency is not applicable; instead, energy consumption is measured in 'kWh per 100 km' (kWh/100km).", "normalised": "when considering different fuels, like C-N-G or L-P-G, the measurement units may vary.

{"unnormalised": "In addition to distance-based measures, the energy content of fuel is also a significant factor. This is often expressed in units like megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg) or British thermal units per gallon (BTU/gallon). These units are used to compare the energy density of different fuel types and provide a more comprehensive understanding of their efficiency. A fuel with a higher MJ/kg value contains more energy per unit mass, potentially leading to better performance.", "normalised": "in addition to distance-based measures, the energy content of fuel is also a significant factor. this is often expressed in units like megajoules per kilogram (M-J per kilogram) or British thermal units per gallon (B-T-U per gallon). these units are used to compare the energy density of different fuel types and provide a more comprehensive understanding of their efficiency. a fuel with a higher M-J per kilogram value contains more energy per unit mass, potentially leading to better performance."}
