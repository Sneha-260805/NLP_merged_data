{"unnormalised": "Let’s talk numbers for a sec. Last month, my car guzzled about 50 litres of petrol, costing me a small fortune. And it's not just cars; consider the trucks carrying goods across the country. Each of those monsters probably burns through 200+ litres on a single trip from Delhi to Mumbai. That’s a whole lotta fuel! Imagine the costs for those businesses and how it eventually reflects in the prices of everyday stuff.", "normalised": "Let's talk numbers for a sec.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). Many auto-rickshaws and taxis in cities like Delhi run on CNG. It’s considered a cleaner fuel, and it's generally cheaper than petrol or diesel. You can probably run an auto for a whole day using just 10 kg of CNG, which is pretty efficient. So, that’s a step in the right direction.", "normalised": "Then there's C-N-G (Compressed Natural Gas). Many auto-rickshaws and taxis in cities like Delhi run on C-N-G.
