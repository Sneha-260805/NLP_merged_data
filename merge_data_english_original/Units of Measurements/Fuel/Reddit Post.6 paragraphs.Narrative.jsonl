{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are downsides. The car feels a bit sluggish, especially when accelerating from a standstill. And finding a CNG station that isn't overcrowded is a daily challenge. Sometimes, you're stuck in a queue for 30 mins just to fill up. Also, the mileage has reduced. Earlier it used to give 18 km/l on petrol. Now, on CNG, it's around 15 km/kg.", "normalised": "Of course, there are downsides. The car feels a bit sluggish, especially when accelerating from a standstill.
