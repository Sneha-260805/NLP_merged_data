Inflating the tyres to 35 psi (front & rear, as recommended) nearly made me lose control near the Vakola flyover, but hey, gotta save those precious milliliters, right? Next, I considered switching to those \"mileage booster\" additives they sell at the petrol pumps, but something tells me those are about as effective as homeopathy for a broken leg.", "normalised": "I have tried everything to squeeze out a bit more mileage.

That's like finding a ₹500 note in your old jeans – pure gold, I tell you.
