{"unnormalised": "We often talk about \"mileage\" when it comes to cars, but what does that really mean? It's all about fuel efficiency, measured in different ways depending on where you are. In India, we generally use kmpl, short for kilometers per liter. So, if your bike gives you 60 kmpl, it means you can travel 60 kilometers on just one liter of petrol. Simple, right? But there's more to it than just that single number.", "normalised": "We often talk about \"mileage\" when it comes to cars, but what does that really mean?

{"unnormalised": "Think about filling up your scooter. You might say, \"Bhai, please fill petrol worth Rs. 500.\" That's buying fuel based on cost, not volume. You're getting a certain number of liters, but you're focusing on the price you're paying. A liter might cost ₹105.42 today, but that price fluctuates, affecting how far your money goes. Plus, the fuel tank capacity of a scooty pep is usually around 5 Litres, so you have to consider how far a full tank will get you.", "normalised": "Think about filling up your scooter.

{"unnormalised": "Now, bigger vehicles like trucks don't worry so much about kmpl. They use a different metric – liters per 100 km (l/100km). This tells you how many liters of diesel they need to travel 100 kilometers. A truck hauling goods from Delhi to Mumbai might use, say, 30l/100km. It is also important to consider the density of the fuel for long trips. Density of diesel for example is around 0.832 kg/L.", "normalised": "Now, bigger vehicles like trucks don't worry so much about kilometer per liter. They use a different metric – liters per one hundred kilometer. This tells you how many liters of diesel they need to travel one hundred kilometers.

Density of diesel for example is around zero point eight three two kilogram per liter."}
{"unnormalised": "Internationally, you’ll often hear about miles per gallon (mpg), especially in the US. It is a common metric in Europe as well. It's just another way to say how far you can travel on a specific amount of fuel. Converting between kmpl and mpg can get a little tricky, involving conversions between kilometers and miles, and liters and gallons. One gallon is approximately 3.785 liters. So you can convert litres to gallons and kilometer to miles to figure out the mileage in miles per gallon.", "normalised": "Internationally, you’ll often hear about miles per gallon, especially in the U-S.

Whether you're checking the kmpl of your new car or calculating liters per 100 km for a long-haul journey, knowing these figures allows you to budget, plan, and drive a little smarter and plan fuel stops better.", "normalised": "Ultimately, understanding these different units of measurement helps us make informed decisions about our vehicles and fuel consumption.
