{"unnormalised": "First up, **liters (L)**. This is the standard unit of volume used to measure fuel. Whether it's petrol, diesel, or CNG, you'll find its volume expressed in liters at the petrol pump. Remember filling your tank with exactly 50 L?

{"unnormalised": "Then we have **kilometers per liter (kmpl)**, a critical metric for understanding fuel efficiency. If your car gives you 25 kmpl, it means it can travel 25 kilometers on one liter of fuel. The higher the kmpl, the better the fuel efficiency. A scooter might boast 60 kmpl, while a large SUV might offer a more modest 12 kmpl.", "normalised": "Then we have **kilometers per liter (kilometer per liter)**, a critical metric for understanding fuel efficiency. If your car gives you twenty five kilometer per liter, it means it can travel twenty five kilometers on one liter of fuel. The higher the kilometer per liter, the better the fuel efficiency. A scooter might boast sixty kilometer per liter, while a large S-U-V might offer a more modest twelve kilometer per liter."}
{"unnormalised": "Moving on, we encounter **miles per gallon (mpg)**, a unit commonly used in the US and some other countries. While not as prevalent in India, it’s useful to be aware. Converting from kmpl to mpg isn't straightforward, but a rough conversion factor is 2.35. So, 20 kmpl is approximately 47 mpg.", "normalised": "Moving on, we encounter **miles per gallon (M-P-G)**, a unit commonly used in the U-S and some other countries.

So, twenty kilometer per liter is approximately forty seven M-P-G."}
{"unnormalised": "Sometimes, fuel consumption is also expressed as **liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km)**. This represents how many liters of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel 100 kilometers. It's an inverse measure of fuel efficiency compared to kmpl. A lower L/100km value indicates better efficiency. Think of it this way: 8 L/100km means the car needs 8 liters to travel 100 kilometers.", "normalised": "Sometimes, fuel consumption is also expressed as **liters per one hundred kilometers (L slash one hundred kilometer)**. This represents how many liters of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel one hundred kilometers. It is an inverse measure of fuel efficiency compared to kilometer per liter. A lower L slash one hundred kilometer value indicates better efficiency. Think of it this way: eight L slash one hundred kilometer means the car needs eight liters to travel one hundred kilometers."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let's consider fuel tank capacity, typically expressed in liters. A Maruti Suzuki Alto might have a fuel tank capacity of around 35L, while a Toyota Fortuner can hold upwards of 80 L.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel quality also plays a role. Octane rating, often measured in **Research Octane Number (RON)**, indicates the fuel's resistance to knocking or pre-ignition.
