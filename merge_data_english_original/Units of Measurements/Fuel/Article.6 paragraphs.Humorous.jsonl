Ask any potential car buyer, and the first question after \"kitna deti hai?\" (how much does it give?) is about fuel efficiency. We Indians measure fuel consumption like our ancestors measured distances – in \"kitna duur jaata hai?\" (how far does it go?). Forget liters per 100 km, we want to know how many chai breaks we can squeeze in between refills.

Car manufacturers quote ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) figures, which are achieved in a lab, under ideal conditions, probably with the engine running on fairy dust.

And that, my friends, is a unit of measurement worth celebrating. After all, how else are we going to solve all of India’s problems? Over chai, obviously.", "normalised": "So, the next time someone asks you \"mileage kitna hai?\", just shrug, smile, and say, \"Enough to get me to the next chai stall.\" Because ultimately, in India, fuel efficiency isn't about saving money; it's about maximizing the number of tea breaks per tank.
