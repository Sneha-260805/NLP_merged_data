{"unnormalised": "First off, when we talk about mileage, it's usually measured in kmpl, or kilometers per liter. That basically tells you how many kilometers your vehicle can travel on 1 liter of fuel. But remember, the \"official\" kmpl figures quoted by manufacturers are often achieved under ideal conditions – think smooth roads, no traffic, and gentle acceleration. Real-world kmpl can vary quite a bit.", "normalised": "First off, when we talk about mileage, it's usually measured in K-M-P-L, or kilometers per liter.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing to consider is the difference between liters and gallons. We mostly use liters here, but if you're reading international reviews, they might talk about miles per gallon (mpg). To roughly convert from mpg to kmpl, you can divide by 2.35. So, if a US review says a car gets 30 mpg, that's roughly 12.7 kmpl.", "normalised": "Another thing to consider is the difference between liters and gallons.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about fuel quality. In India, we mostly have petrol rated as 91 octane. Some premium fuels boast higher octane numbers, like 95 octane or even 99 octane. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to knocking, which can improve engine performance and efficiency. However, unless your car specifically requires a higher octane fuel, you might not see a significant difference, and you'll be paying a higher price per liter.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about fuel quality.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's fuel adulteration. Unfortunately, it's a real problem in some areas. Adulterated fuel can damage your engine and drastically reduce your mileage. Try to stick to reputable fuel stations and be wary if you notice a sudden drop in your kmpl. You can also buy fuel testing kits for around Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000 to check for adulteration.", "normalised": "Then there's fuel adulteration. Unfortunately, it's a real problem in some areas.

{"unnormalised": "Tire pressure also plays a big role! Underinflated tires increase rolling resistance, meaning your engine has to work harder, consuming more fuel. Check your owner's manual for the recommended tire pressure, usually given in PSI (pounds per square inch) and maintain it regularly.
