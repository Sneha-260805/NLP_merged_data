{"unnormalised": "One of the most commonly encountered units is the **litre (L)**, a fundamental unit of volume in the metric system. Fuel tank capacities are typically expressed in litres, providing a clear indication of the amount of fuel a vehicle can hold. This measurement directly influences the vehicle's range and refueling frequency. For instance, a car with a 50L tank can travel further than one with a 40L tank, assuming similar fuel consumption rates.", "normalised": "One of the most commonly encountered units is the **liter (L)**, a fundamental unit of volume in the metric system.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel efficiency, a key consideration for consumers and manufacturers, is often expressed in **kilometres per litre (km/L)**. This metric indicates the distance a vehicle can travel on one litre of fuel. A higher km/L value signifies greater fuel efficiency, translating to lower fuel costs and reduced emissions. Manufacturers invest significantly in research and development to improve the km/L performance of their vehicles. Alternatively, in some regions, **miles per gallon (mpg)** is used, requiring conversion for those accustomed to the metric system.", "normalised": "Fuel efficiency, a key consideration for consumers and manufacturers, is often expressed in **kilometers per liter (kilometer slash liter)**.
