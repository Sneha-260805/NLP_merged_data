It was my dad's old Maruti eight hundred, a trusty little vehicle that had seen better days. I was maybe eighteen, just got my license, and Dad, bless his heart, was slowly letting me take the reins. The petrol gauge was blinking – a very insistent blink, I might add. So, off I went, feeling a heady mix of freedom and responsibility."}

I vaguely remembered Dad saying something about \"regular\" versus \"premium,\" but that's where my knowledge ended.

One time, I experimented and filled it to the brim, costing me rupees two thousand seven hundred and fifty, I think. It was a bit of a waste, really, carrying all that extra weight around. Later, I became more careful about fuel efficiency. I even downloaded an app to track my mileage and calculate the average consumption, usually around fifteen kilometers per litre in the city and eighteen kilometers per litre on the highway. The app showed I was spending approximately rupees four thousand per month on fuel."}
