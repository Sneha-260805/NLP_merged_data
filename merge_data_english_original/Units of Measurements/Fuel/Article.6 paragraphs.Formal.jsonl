{"unnormalised": "Fuel efficiency is a critical aspect of the Indian automotive industry, particularly given the fluctuating prices of petrol and diesel. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the kmpl (kilometers per liter) figure when making purchasing decisions. Automakers constantly strive to improve this metric through technological advancements and engine optimization. This focus translates directly into reduced running costs for vehicle owners, a significant advantage in the Indian context where cost-consciousness is paramount. Factors such as traffic congestion in cities like Mumbai and Delhi also influence real-world fuel consumption.", "normalised": "Fuel efficiency is a critical aspect of the Indian automotive industry, particularly given the fluctuating prices of petrol and diesel.

{"unnormalised": "The government plays a role in promoting fuel efficiency through various regulations and initiatives. BS6 (Bharat Stage 6) emission norms, for instance, mandate stricter emission standards for vehicles sold in India, indirectly contributing to improved fuel economy. The promotion of alternative fuels such as CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and electric vehicles is another strategy aimed at reducing dependence on conventional fossil fuels. The implementation of fuel efficiency labeling programs allows consumers to easily compare the fuel consumption of different vehicle models. A lot of auto rickshaws run on CNG to save costs, around 20 rupees/kg in Delhi.", "normalised": "The government plays a role in promoting fuel efficiency through various regulations and initiatives.

{"unnormalised": "Various factors influence a vehicle's fuel efficiency. Engine size, weight, aerodynamics, and tire pressure all play a significant role. Regular maintenance, including oil changes and air filter replacements, can also have a positive impact on kmpl figures. Driving habits, such as avoiding aggressive acceleration and maintaining a consistent speed, are crucial for maximizing fuel economy. Many drivers don't realize their driving style significantly affects how many kms/liter they get.", "normalised": "Various factors influence a vehicle's fuel efficiency.
