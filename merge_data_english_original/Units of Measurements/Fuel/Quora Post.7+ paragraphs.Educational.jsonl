{"unnormalised": "What are the different units used to measure fuel in India? And why does it matter?", "normalised": "Well, that's a great question! In India, like much of the world, we primarily use liters (L) to measure liquid fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel. You'll see prices quoted as rupee one hundred five point fifty per liter for petrol or rupee ninety five per liter for diesel, give or take depending on the city and current taxes. Auto-rickshaw walas and car owners alike are very familiar with the price per liter! You'll also often see smaller quantities like five hundred milliliter or two hundred fifty milliliter referenced, perhaps when discussing additives."}

You'll also often see smaller quantities like 500ml or 250ml referenced, perhaps when discussing additives.", "normalised": "However, understanding how much fuel you're using often requires thinking beyond just liters. For instance, fuel efficiency is typically expressed as kilometers per liter (kilometer slash liter). A bike might give sixty kilometer per liter, while a large S-U-V might only manage ten kilometer per liter. These figures are crucial when comparing vehicle performance and calculating running costs. It's worth noting the kilometer slash liter unit is sometimes abbreviated further to just 'kilometer per liter'. Even though \"kilometer per liter\" isn't technically a standard unit, it's universally understood in the Indian context."}

While C-N-G is still technically a fuel, it’s often measured in kilograms (kilogram). You might see C-N-G being sold at rupee seventy five per kilogram. There's a reason for this. Gases are compressible, so volume is more variable. Mass is a more consistent measure of the amount of energy you are getting. Conversions between kilograms of C-N-G and equivalent liters of petrol can be a bit complex and depend on factors like pressure and temperature, but generally, a kilogram of C-N-G gives you roughly the same energy as one point four liters of petrol."}

While volume in liters is still important, airlines and fuel suppliers also pay close attention to mass in metric tons (tonnes). Factors like density and the specific energy content of the fuel batch are critically important for flight planning. A Boeing seven forty seven might take on board one hundred thousand plus liters or about eighty metric tons of A-T-F for a long-haul flight. These numbers are monitored carefully to ensure safe and efficient operation."}

While volume in litres is still important, airlines and fuel suppliers also pay close attention to mass in *metric tons* (tonnes). Factors like density and the specific energy content of the fuel batch are critically important for flight planning. A Boeing 777 might take on board 100,000+ litres or about 80 metric tons of ATF for a long-haul flight. These numbers are monitored carefully to ensure safe and efficient operation.", "normalised": "Another aspect to consider is the energy content of different fuels. While liters and kilograms tell us the quantity, they don't directly tell us the energy available. This is where units like megajoules per kilogram (M-J slash kilogram) come in. Petrol, diesel, and C-N-G all have different M-J slash kilogram values. Knowing these energy densities is crucial for optimizing engine design and fuel consumption. For example, diesel generally has a higher energy density than petrol (around forty five M-J slash kilogram versus forty two M-J slash kilogram), which contributes to its better fuel economy in many applications."}

You’ll rarely see gallons (gal) used to measure fuel in India – our colonial past notwithstanding. You might see it mentioned when comparing Indian fuel efficiency with those from the U-S. Barrels (bbl) are generally reserved for crude oil rather than refined fuel products. So, while global oil prices might be quoted in U-S-D per barrel (for example, dollar eighty five per barrel), you won’t usually see petrol priced that way at your local petrol pump."}
