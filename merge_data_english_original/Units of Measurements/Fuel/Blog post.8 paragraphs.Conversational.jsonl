{"unnormalised": "First up, tyre pressure. Seems simple, but loads of people ignore it. Check your tyre pressure regularly! Under-inflated tyres increase rolling resistance, which means you're burning extra fuel. Your owner's manual will tell you the correct pressure, usually around 30-32 psi for bikes and 32-35 psi for cars. That's pounds per square inch, okay?", "normalised": "First up, tire pressure.

Highway cruising at 80 kmph is way more efficient than constantly weaving through traffic and slamming on the brakes.

{"unnormalised": "Proper maintenance is key. Get your vehicle serviced regularly. A dirty air filter, clogged fuel injectors, or old spark plugs can significantly reduce fuel efficiency.

{"unnormalised": "Also, plan your route. Avoid peak hour traffic whenever possible. Stop-start traffic is a major fuel killer.

And don’t just fill up the tank when it's almost empty. Keep it topped up to about 3/4 full to minimize fuel evaporation, especially during the hot summer months when the temperature can reach 48°C. Happy driving, and save those rupees!", "normalised": "Finally, fuel quality matters. Use good quality fuel from a reputable petrol pump.
