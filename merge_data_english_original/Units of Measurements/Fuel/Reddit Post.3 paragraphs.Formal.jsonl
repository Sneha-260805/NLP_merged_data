My car, a Maruti Suzuki Alto eight hundred, claims a mileage of twenty two point zero five kilometers per liter as per the company. However, in real world driving conditions in the city, I barely manage sixteen kilometers per liter. I understand traffic and driving style affect this, but the difference seems significant. Is this normal?"}

Are there any simple things, like tire pressure (usually keep mine at thirty two P-S-I), that can noticeably improve fuel economy?"}
