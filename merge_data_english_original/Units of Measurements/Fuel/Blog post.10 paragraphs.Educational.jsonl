{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's understand what kmpl represents. It's a simple ratio: distance traveled (in kilometers) divided by the amount of fuel consumed (in liters). So, a car that gives 20 kmpl means it can travel 20 kilometers on 1 liter of fuel. This is the most common metric, especially for bikes and smaller cars. For bigger vehicles like SUVs and trucks, people might also talk about miles per gallon (mpg), though it's less common here.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's understand what kilometer per liter represents. It's a simple ratio: distance traveled (in kilometers) divided by the amount of fuel consumed (in liters). So, a car that gives twenty kilometer per liter means it can travel twenty kilometers on one liter of fuel. This is the most common metric, especially for bikes and smaller cars. For bigger vehicles like S-U-Vs and trucks, people might also talk about miles per gallon, though it's less common here."}
{"unnormalised": "However, focusing solely on kmpl can be misleading. Several factors influence a vehicle's fuel consumption. Driving style plays a huge role. Aggressive acceleration and braking consume more fuel than smooth, gradual movements. Maintaining a consistent speed on highways, say around 80 km/h, can significantly improve your mileage. Constantly revving the engine burns fuel unnecessarily.", "normalised": "However, focusing solely on kilometer per liter can be misleading. Several factors influence a vehicle's fuel consumption.

{"unnormalised": "Vehicle maintenance is another key factor. Regularly servicing your car, ensuring proper tire inflation (usually measured in psi or pounds per square inch – check your car's manual!), and using the correct grade of engine oil (often specified by weight, like 10W-30) can all contribute to better fuel efficiency. A poorly maintained engine has to work harder, leading to higher fuel consumption.", "normalised": "Vehicle maintenance is another key factor.

{"unnormalised": "Air resistance also matters, especially at higher speeds. Think about the difference between driving with the windows up versus down on the highway. With windows down, the car faces more drag, requiring more fuel to maintain speed. The weight of the car too; hauling around an extra 50 kg in the boot will decrease fuel effeciency.", "normalised": "Air resistance also matters, especially at higher speeds.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the type of driving you do. City driving, with its frequent stops and starts, is generally less fuel-efficient than highway driving. The constant idling at traffic signals eats up fuel. Think of auto-rickshaws (autos) idling at a rate of 1 litre/hour on average during rush hour at junctions.", "normalised": "Then there's the type of driving you do.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond kmpl, consider the overall energy efficiency of the vehicle. This includes factors like the engine's thermal efficiency (how well it converts fuel energy into mechanical energy), the vehicle's weight, and its aerodynamic design. Electric vehicles (EVs), for example, are inherently more energy-efficient than petrol or diesel cars because they convert electrical energy into motion with much less waste. Some EVs can give an equivalent of 40 kmpl, or more, when compared to petrol cars.", "normalised": "Beyond kilometer per liter, consider the overall energy efficiency of the vehicle.

{"unnormalised": "Fuel consumption is also expressed in terms of litres per 100 km (l/100km), which may be a more useful metric for larger commercial vehicles that transport goods across long distances. This helps truck drivers to keep tabs of their fuel consumption over long hauls.", "normalised": "Fuel consumption is also expressed in terms of liters per one hundred kilometer, which may be a more useful metric for larger commercial vehicles that transport goods across long distances.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, improving fuel efficiency is a multi-faceted approach. It's not just about the kmpl figure; it's about understanding the factors that influence fuel consumption and adopting practices that minimize waste. Being mindful of your driving style, maintaining your vehicle properly, and using high-quality fuel can all contribute to significant savings over time. Furthermore, explore alternatives like EVs or hybrid vehicles that offer inherently better fuel efficiency, especially if you are environmentally concious.", "normalised": "Ultimately, improving fuel efficiency is a multi-faceted approach.
