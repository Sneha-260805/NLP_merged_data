We’re constantly obsessed with mileage. “Kitna deti hai?” – the quintessential Indian question, not just for our cars, but also for our relationships, our jobs, and even our weekend getaways. Is this vacation worth the five hundred kilometer drive? Is this relationship worth the emotional fifty liters of stress? Are my Sunday morning aloo parathas worth the extra two hundred grams I’ll gain? These are the questions that plague my existence."}

We've got gallons (thanks, Angrez!), cubic centimeters (c-c for those fancy bike engines), and even, I suspect, some mythical \"bharipet\" measurement that only auto-rickshaw drivers understand. My poor brain short-circuits trying to convert it all! Is one gallon of petrol enough to get me through this Monday? Or do I need to mentally calculate the c-c per kilometer of my emotional resilience?"}

There's always that moment of panic when you see the numbers climbing higher and higher. You start doing mental gymnastics. \"Okay, rupees two thousand… that should be enough… unless inflation has secretly doubled the price of petrol again!\" And then, the pump guy, with his uncanny ability to stop exactly at the predicted amount (or slightly over, just to mess with you), smiles knowingly. Is he psychic? Does he have a degree in fuel-related sorcery? I suspect the latter."}

Or maybe just electricity."}
