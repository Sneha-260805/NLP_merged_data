But what do all those terms and figures actually mean? Let's break it down in simple terms."}
{"unnormalised": "First off, you'll often hear about \"kmpl\" or \"km/l.\" That stands for kilometers per liter. It's the most common way fuel efficiency is measured in India. For instance, if your car gives you 20 kmpl, it means you can drive 20 kilometers on 1 liter of fuel. Simple, right? Some older cars might show mpg (miles per gallon) which is a completely different unit, and generally much larger value!", "normalised": "First off, you'll often hear about \"kilometer per liter\" or \"kilometer per liter.\" That stands for kilometers per liter.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's fuel tank capacity, often quoted in liters (L). Knowing your tank’s capacity, say 45L, helps you estimate the maximum distance you can travel on a full tank. Do the math: 45L x 20 kmpl = 900 km. Of course, this is a theoretical maximum – real-world conditions vary.", "normalised": "Then there's fuel tank capacity, often quoted in liters (L). Knowing your tank’s capacity, say forty five L, helps you estimate the maximum distance you can travel on a full tank. Do the math: forty five L multiplied by twenty kilometer per liter equals nine hundred kilometer. Of course, this is a theoretical maximum – real-world conditions vary."}
{"unnormalised": "Real-world mileage can differ significantly from what manufacturers claim. You might see an \"ARAI-certified\" figure of, say, 25 kmpl. ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) tests cars under controlled conditions. However, city driving with frequent stops and starts, heavy traffic, and AC usage will usually lower that figure. Expect something closer to 15 kmpl in congested cities like Mumbai.", "normalised": "Real-world mileage can differ significantly from what manufacturers claim.

However, city driving with frequent stops and starts, heavy traffic, and A-C usage will usually lower that figure. Expect something closer to fifteen kilometer per liter in congested cities like Mumbai."}
{"unnormalised": "Another factor is tire pressure, measured in PSI (pounds per square inch). Incorrect tire pressure can reduce fuel efficiency. Check your car's manual; it typically recommends a pressure like 32 PSI for the front tires and 30 PSI for the rear. Under-inflated tires increase rolling resistance, forcing the engine to work harder.", "normalised": "Another factor is tire pressure, measured in P-S-I (pounds per square inch). Incorrect tire pressure can reduce fuel efficiency. Check your car's manual; it typically recommends a pressure like thirty two P-S-I for the front tires and thirty P-S-I for the rear. Under-inflated tires increase rolling resistance, forcing the engine to work harder."}
{"unnormalised": "Engine size also plays a role. Smaller engines, like a 1.2L engine, are generally more fuel-efficient than larger ones, say a 2.0L engine. However, if the smaller engine is constantly strained (e.g., when fully loaded or climbing hills), its fuel efficiency might drop considerably. A well-maintained engine, with regular servicing and oil changes (perhaps using 3.5L of oil), will always perform better.", "normalised": "Engine size also plays a role. Smaller engines, like a one point two L engine, are generally more fuel-efficient than larger ones, say a two point zero L engine. However, if the smaller engine is constantly strained (e.g., when fully loaded or climbing hills), its fuel efficiency might drop considerably. A well-maintained engine, with regular servicing and oil changes (perhaps using three point five L of oil), will always perform better."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, driving style makes a huge difference. Aggressive acceleration, hard braking, and speeding all consume more fuel. Smooth, consistent driving at a moderate speed (say, 60 kmph on the highway) will maximize your kmpl. So, drive responsibly, maintain your car well, and understand these basic units to get the most out of every liter!", "normalised": "Finally, driving style makes a huge difference.
