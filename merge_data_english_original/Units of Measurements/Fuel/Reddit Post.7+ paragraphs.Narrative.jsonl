{"unnormalised": "Moral of the story: always factor in the terrain, driving conditions, and your own driving style when estimating fuel consumption. And keep a buffer – it's always better to have a bit of extra fuel than to be stranded on the side of the road, especially during monsoon! Next time, I'm definitely planning more strategically and carrying a spare 5 liters can just in case.
