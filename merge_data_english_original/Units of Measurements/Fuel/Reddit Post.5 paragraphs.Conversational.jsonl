Last month I was getting around 18 kmpl, but now it's barely touching 15 kmpl. Could the recent petrol price hike have something to do with it?

{"unnormalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues? I'm thinking of getting my car serviced soon. Heard from a friend that changing the air filter can improve fuel efficiency. The mechanic at the local garage mentioned something about checking the tire pressure too. He said that under-inflated tires can decrease mileage by like, 0.5-1 kmpl. Is that even possible?", "normalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues? I am thinking of getting my car serviced soon. Heard from a friend that changing the air filter can improve fuel efficiency.

{"unnormalised": "Also, I've been considering switching to premium fuel. Heard it gives better mileage, but it's also significantly more expensive. Is it worth the extra cost? I usually put in about 35 litres of petrol when I fill up. If premium fuel gives, say, 2 kmpl extra, will that offset the increased price? Or am I better off sticking to regular petrol?", "normalised": "Also, I have been considering switching to premium fuel. Heard it gives better mileage, but it is also significantly more expensive.

{"unnormalised": "Someone suggested using fuel additives to clean the engine and improve efficiency. Are those things actually effective, or are they just a waste of money? There are so many brands out there, it's hard to know which ones are legit. Saw one online that claims to improve mileage by 10%, but that seems too good to be true. Anyone have any experience with these additives?", "normalised": "Someone suggested using fuel additives to clean the engine and improve efficiency.
