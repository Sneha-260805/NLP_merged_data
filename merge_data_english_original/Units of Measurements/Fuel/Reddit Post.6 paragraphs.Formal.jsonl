{"unnormalised": "Firstly, I'm seeing petrol prices quoted in Rs. per litre, sometimes as ₹/L. Are these interchangeable? Also, is there a standard conversion rate used when comparing petrol prices in different cities, considering things like taxes and transportation costs? I'm noticing a significant variance, sometimes up to Rs. 5 per litre, which seems substantial.", "normalised": "Firstly, I'm seeing petrol prices quoted in rupees per liter, sometimes as rupee per liter.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, many older vehicles still report fuel efficiency in kmpl, like 15 kmpl, while newer models often use L/100km. Is there a simple way to convert between these two units, or does it depend on the specific fuel type (petrol vs diesel)? A straightforward formula would be very helpful.", "normalised": "Secondly, many older vehicles still report fuel efficiency in kilometer per liter, like fifteen kilometer per liter, while newer models often use liter per one hundred kilometer.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, when discussing bulk fuel purchases for industrial use, I've seen measurements in kiloliters (kL) and cubic meters (m^3). Are these units equivalent (1 kL = 1 m^3)? What about converting these units to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)? Is there a standard factor used in India for this conversion, especially considering the diverse sources of crude oil that we import? I saw one article mentioning that 1 BOE= approximately 0.159 kL. Is this a reliable estimate?", "normalised": "Thirdly, when discussing bulk fuel purchases for industrial use, I've seen measurements in kiloliters and cubic meters.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, I’m seeing fuel tank capacities listed in both liters (L) and gallons (gal). As the US gallon is different from the imperial gallon, which unit is more often used for vehicle specifications in India, if any? The local Maruti dealer stated that the tank capacity is 35L, but another source quoted 9.2 gal. Which one is more appropriate for use in India?", "normalised": "Fourthly, I’m seeing fuel tank capacities listed in both liters and gallons.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, considering the push for alternative fuels, how are measurements standardized for CNG (cubic meters or kg) and electricity (kWh)? If I'm comparing the cost of driving an electric vehicle vs. a petrol car, what's the best way to equate the energy consumption of each vehicle, considering units such as Rs/km or Rs/mile? I hope someone can shed some light on these issues!", "normalised": "Finally, considering the push for alternative fuels, how are measurements standardized for C-N-G, cubic meters or kilogram, and electricity, kilowatt hour?
