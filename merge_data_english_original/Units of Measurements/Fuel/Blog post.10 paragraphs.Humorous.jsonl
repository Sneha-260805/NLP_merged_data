{"unnormalised": "Next, the real shocker: regular servicing. I know, I know, it sounds boring, but apparently, a well-maintained engine runs smoother and uses less fuel. Who would've thought? My mechanic, Raju, told me my air filter was so clogged it looked like it had been collecting dust from the moon. A new filter, some fresh oil, and Bessie was purring like a kitten.
