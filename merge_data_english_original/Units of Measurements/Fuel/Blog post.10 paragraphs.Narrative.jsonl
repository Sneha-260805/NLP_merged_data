Living in Mumbai, where every rupee counts, the increasing cost of petrol was starting to feel like a personal attack. My trusty old scooter, a Bajaj Chetak – yes, I know, it's practically vintage – was suddenly looking less charming and more like a gas-guzzling monster."}

Raju Bhai charged me rupee three hundred and fifty to clean the Carburetor."}

That even small changes in driving habits and regular maintenance can make a big difference in fuel efficiency.
