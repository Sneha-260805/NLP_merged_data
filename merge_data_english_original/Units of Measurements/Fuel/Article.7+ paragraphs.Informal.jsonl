{"unnormalised": "Then there's the efficiency game. \"Kitna deti hai?\" is the quintessential Indian question when buying a vehicle. And the answer is always given in km/L (kilometres per litre). This is all well and good for petrol and diesel, but for CNG? We're back to kg again. So, you have to mentally convert kg to litres to figure out how much you're saving. My head hurts just thinking about it.

Or, maybe just a simple conversion chart readily available at every CNG station. Until then, we'll keep scratching our heads, calculating fuel costs, and trying to make sense of the litres and kilograms dance. And perhaps, that's part of the charm of driving in India.
