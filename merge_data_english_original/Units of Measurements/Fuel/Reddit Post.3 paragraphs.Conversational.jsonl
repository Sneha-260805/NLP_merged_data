{"unnormalised": "So, if my math is right, I'll need about 40 liters of petrol (600km / 15kmpl). What are the current petrol prices on average along that route? Last time I checked it was around ₹105/L in Karnataka, but I'm guessing it might be slightly different in Goa. Any info is appreciated!", "normalised": "So, if my math is right, I will need about forty liters of petrol (six hundred kilometer divided by fifteen kilometers per litre).
