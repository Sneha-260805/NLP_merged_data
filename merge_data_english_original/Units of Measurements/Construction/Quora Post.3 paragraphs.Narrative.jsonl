He initially estimated the built-up area to be around 1000 sq ft, but it ended up being closer to 1200 sq ft because of the verandah he added later. That extra 200 sq ft cost him in materials, especially cement!", "normalised": "Someone asked me how much cement is required for constructing a small house in India.

It's always best to consult a civil engineer who can provide a more accurate estimate based on your specific design, soil conditions, and the type of construction you're planning. My uncle ended up buying an extra 20 bags, which he used later for some minor repairs and landscaping. Better to have a little extra than to run short in the middle of construction, bhai!", "normalised": "Of course, these are rough figures.
