{"unnormalised": "Regarding the proposed construction project, the blueprint specifies using steel rods that are 12mm in diameter and 6m in length. Furthermore, the concrete mix should adhere to a 1:2:4 ratio, ensuring a compressive strength of at least 30 MPa after 28 days. The total land area allocated for the project is approximately 5000 sq ft. Any deviation from these specifications requires written approval from the project engineer.", "normalised": "Regarding the proposed construction project, the blueprint specifies using steel rods that are twelve millimeter in diameter and six meter in length. Furthermore, the concrete mix should adhere to a one to two to four ratio, ensuring a compressive strength of at least thirty M-P-A after twenty eight days. The total land area allocated for the project is approximately five thousand square feet. Any deviation from these specifications requires written approval from the project engineer."}
