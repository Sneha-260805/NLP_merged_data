{"unnormalised": "When planning construction, understanding units is key! Remember, 1 acre equals approx. 43,560 sq ft. Builders often use both sq ft and sq m (1 sq m = roughly 10.76 sq ft) when quoting prices. Also, concrete is usually measured in cubic meters (m^3). Don't confuse linear ft with sq ft when calculating material needs for walls or fencing.
