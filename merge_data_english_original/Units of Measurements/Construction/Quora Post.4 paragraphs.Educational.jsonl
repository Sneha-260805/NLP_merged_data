{"unnormalised": "Well, in India, const sites use a mix of metric and imperial units, though metric is standard. For length, you'll commonly hear things like mm (millimeters) for fine measurements in drawings, cm (centimeters) for smaller dimensions, m (meters) for larger spans and distances, and sometimes even ft (feet) for things like ceiling heights or room dimensions, esp. if older blueprints are involved. A standard brick might be 9 in long, for example.", "normalised": "Well, in India, construction sites use a mix of metric and imperial units, though metric is standard.

{"unnormalised": "For area, sq ft (square feet) is very common for plot sizes and carpet area, even though sq m (square meters) is the official unit. You'll see property ads quoting rates per sq ft. Then there's acres and hectares for larger land parcels, especially in rural areas. Volume, for concrete or aggregates, is typically measured in cubic meters (m^3) or sometimes cft (cubic feet), particularly by older contractors. The amount of cement needed might be spec'd in kgs (kilograms) too.", "normalised": "For area, square feet is very common for plot sizes and carpet area, even though square meters is the official unit.

{"unnormalised": "Weight is usually specified in kgs (kilograms) or tonnes (metric tons) for materials like steel or cement. Rebar is often sold by the weight, priced at Rs. X per kg. Pressure, like for water supply testing, is measured in psi (pounds per square inch) or bars. Even though pascals (Pa) are the SI unit, psi is still frequently used in practice.", "normalised": "Weight is usually specified in kilograms or tonnes for materials like steel or cement. Rebar is often sold by the weight, priced at rupees X per kilogram. Pressure, like for water supply testing, is measured in pounds per square inch or bars. Even though pascals are the S-I unit, pounds per square inch is still frequently used in practice."}
{"unnormalised": "It's important to be conversant with both metric and imperial units, as you'll encounter them both. Understanding the conversions between them is essential to avoid confusion on site. For example, knowing that 1 meter is roughly 3.28 ft is helpful for quick estimations. Also, remember to always double check the units specified in any contract or design document to avoid costly mistakes.", "normalised": "It is important to be conversant with both metric and imperial units, as you will encounter them both.
