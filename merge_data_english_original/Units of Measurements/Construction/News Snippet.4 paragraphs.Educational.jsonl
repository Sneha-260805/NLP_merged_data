{"unnormalised": "The construction industry in India is increasingly adopting advanced measurement techniques to improve efficiency and accuracy. A recent report highlighted the growing use of laser scanners for surveying sites, with some projects requiring measurements down to 1mm precision. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods using measuring tapes, which often have errors of +/- 5cm over longer distances.", "normalised": "The construction industry in India is increasingly adopting advanced measurement techniques to improve efficiency and accuracy.

{"unnormalised": "The use of specific units is crucial for material estimation. For example, calculating the amount of cement needed for a 100 sq ft wall involves understanding the ratio of cement to sand to aggregate. Similarly, steel reinforcement is typically specified in terms of weight per unit length, like 12mm bars at 1.5 kg/m. Miscalculations can lead to significant cost overruns and structural deficiencies.", "normalised": "The use of specific units is crucial for material estimation. For example, calculating the amount of cement needed for a one hundred square feet wall involves understanding the ratio of cement to sand to aggregate. Similarly, steel reinforcement is typically specified in terms of weight per unit length, like twelve millimeter bars at one point five kilogram per meter. Miscalculations can lead to significant cost overruns and structural deficiencies."}
{"unnormalised": "Environmental factors also play a role. Concrete strength is affected by temperature, with curing times varying significantly between 25°C and 40°C. Accurate measurement of humidity, often expressed as a percentage RH, is also important for preventing issues like efflorescence. Building codes specify minimum and maximum allowable levels for various parameters, often in specific units of measure.", "normalised": "Environmental factors also play a role.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the industry faces the challenge of standardizing unit conversions. While metric units are predominantly used, legacy projects sometimes refer to imperial units, like feet and inches. Converting 6 feet to meters requires precision, and errors can have serious consequences. Training programs aimed at educating construction workers on accurate measurement practices are therefore becoming increasingly important.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the industry faces the challenge of standardizing unit conversions.
