{"unnormalised": "So, I was wondering about something related to construction. When folks talk about building a house or something, they throw around terms like \"sq ft\" and \"sq mtrs\" all the time. What's the actual difference and when do you use which? I'm a bit confused, especially when dealing with contractors who sometimes mix 'em up, causing a headache when trying to figure out material costs!", "normalised": "So, I was wondering about something related to construction.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, \"sq ft\" is square feet, which is an imperial unit of measurement. \"Sq mtrs\" or m2, is square meters, a metric unit. In India, we mostly use both. For smaller areas, like room sizes, people might say \"this room is 10x12 ft\". For larger areas, like a plot of land, you might hear something like \"a 1200 sq ft plot\". Sq mtrs are commonly used in official documents, construction blueprints, and by architects. Think of it like this: 1 sq mtr is roughly equal to 10.764 sq ft, which is a pretty big difference when you're calculating costs!", "normalised": "Basically, \"square feet\" is square feet, which is an imperial unit of measurement. \"Square meters\" or m two, is square meters, a metric unit.

{"unnormalised": "And speaking of costs, that's where it gets really important. A contractor quoting you Rs. 2000 per sq ft for construction sounds different than Rs. 2000 per sq mtr, right? The sq mtr price is significantly higher. Always clarify which unit they’re using. And it helps to know your basic conversions. Also, keep in mind that things like \"cent,\" \"acre,\" and \"hectare\" are still used, especially in certain parts of India for agricultural land. 1 acre equals roughly 43,560 sq ft or about 4047 sq mtrs.", "normalised": "And speaking of costs, that is where it gets really important.

{"unnormalised": "Hope this helps! Understanding the difference between sq ft and sq mtrs in construction can save you a lot of money and prevent confusion. It's really important when you are building something in India to understand what is being talked about. Don't be shy to ask for clarification. Good luck with your construction projects!", "normalised": "Hope this helps!
