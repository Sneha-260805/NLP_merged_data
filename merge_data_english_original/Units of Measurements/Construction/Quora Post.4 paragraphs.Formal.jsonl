{"unnormalised": "In India, the construction industry utilizes a diverse range of units for measurement. For linear dimensions, meters (m) and millimeters (mm) are common, often expressed in drawings. Larger areas, such as plot sizes and floor areas, are typically measured in square feet (sq ft) or square meters (sq m). You might also hear older terms like \"cent,\" where 1 cent roughly equals 435.6 sq ft, especially in land dealings.", "normalised": "In India, the construction industry utilizes a diverse range of units for measurement.

{"unnormalised": "For volumes, cubic meters (cu m) or cubic feet (cu ft) are employed, particularly when calculating the quantity of concrete or earthwork. Thickness is often specified in millimeters (mm) for items like slabs or plaster. Weight is usually expressed in kilograms (kg) or tonnes (t), specifically when dealing with materials like steel reinforcement or cement. Rebar sizes often are stated in mm too; e.g., 12mm rebar.", "normalised": "For volumes, cubic meters (cu m) or cubic feet (cu ft) are employed, particularly when calculating the quantity of concrete or earthwork.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding these units is crucial for accurate material estimation, cost calculation, and effective communication with contractors. For instance, quoting cement in bags is common (often 50kg/bag), but calculations still involve converting to tonnes. If your plan says \"aggregate - 3 cu m\" and you ask a vendor for cubic feet, there might be confusion. Always clarify, and ideally, have your structural engineer provide measurements in standard units.", "normalised": "Understanding these units is crucial for accurate material estimation, cost calculation, and effective communication with contractors.
