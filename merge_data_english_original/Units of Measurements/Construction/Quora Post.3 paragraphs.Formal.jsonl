{"unnormalised": "In the Indian construction industry, several units of measurement are frequently employed. Length is typically measured in millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), meters (m), and kilometers (km) for larger distances like road lengths. Area is often expressed in square feet (sq ft), square meters (sq m), acres, and hectares, especially when dealing with land measurement. It is also common to see the use of \"bigha\" in some regions, but this is highly variable from state to state.", "normalised": "In the Indian construction industry, several units of measurement are frequently employed.

{"unnormalised": "For volume, cubic meters (cu m) are standard for concrete, sand, and other bulk materials. Quantities of cement are often specified in kilograms (kg) or metric tons (MT). Rebar (reinforcement bars) are also measured in metric tons (MT) and their lengths in meters (m). When ordering bricks, one should use numbers, such as \"2000 bricks.\" Additionally, thicknesses of materials, such as plywood or metal sheets, can be in mm or gauge (ga.).", "normalised": "For volume, cubic meters are standard for concrete, sand, and other bulk materials.
