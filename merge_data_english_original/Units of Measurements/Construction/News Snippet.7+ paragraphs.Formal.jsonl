{"unnormalised": "One of the key highlights of the updated guidelines is the mandatory adoption of the International System of Units (SI units) as the primary standard for all construction-related measurements. This transition entails the consistent use of meters (m) for length, square meters (m^2) for area, cubic meters (m^3) for volume, and kilograms (kg) for mass. The Ministry is urging construction firms to adhere strictly to these metrics for design, planning, and execution purposes.", "normalised": "One of the key highlights of the updated guidelines is the mandatory adoption of the International System of Units (S-I units) as the primary standard for all construction-related measurements.

{"unnormalised": "\"The standardization of measurement units is crucial for promoting accuracy and consistency in construction projects,\" stated a senior official from the Ministry. \"The updated guidelines will not only facilitate better communication among stakeholders but also enhance the overall efficiency of construction activities nationwide. Using consistent units will allow the entire project to be developed to a better degree of accuracy. For example, it is recommended that the dimensions of residential buildings, measured in sq. ft., should rather be measured in m^2.\"", "normalised": "\"The standardization of measurement units is crucial for promoting accuracy and consistency in construction projects,\" stated a senior official from the Ministry. \"The updated guidelines will not only facilitate better communication among stakeholders but also enhance the overall efficiency of construction activities nationwide.

For instance, the acceptable deviation in concrete mix design is now defined as +/- 2% in terms of mass. Such specifications are designed to reduce errors and ensure adherence to quality standards throughout the construction lifecycle.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the new regulations incorporate specific tolerances and permissible variations for various construction materials and components.
