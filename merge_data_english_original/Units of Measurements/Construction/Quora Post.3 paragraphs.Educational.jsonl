{"unnormalised": "When it comes to construction in India, you'll often hear a mix of metric and imperial units being used, though the move is definitely towards metric. For land measurement, you might still encounter terms like 'Katha' or 'Bigha,' which vary widely depending on the region. For instance, 1 Bigha in Rajasthan is different from 1 Bigha in Bihar. For more standardized measurements, we use square feet (sq ft) or square meters (sq m) for area calculations. A typical 2 BHK flat might be advertised as 900 sq ft, or roughly 83.6 sq m.", "normalised": "When it comes to construction in India, you will often hear a mix of metric and imperial units being used, though the move is definitely towards metric.

{"unnormalised": "For material quantities, things are more uniform. Cement is usually measured in bags of 50 kg each. Steel is often quoted in metric tonnes (MT), where 1 MT equals 1000 kg. Sand and aggregates are typically measured in cubic feet (cu ft) or cubic meters (m3). So, if you’re ordering sand for your construction, you might order 100 cu ft, which is roughly 2.83 m3. Keep in mind that local vendors might use terms like \"tractor trolley,\" which isn't a standard unit but refers to the amount of material a tractor trolley can carry.", "normalised": "For material quantities, things are more uniform. Cement is usually measured in bags of fifty kilogram each. Steel is often quoted in metric tonnes (M-T), where one M-T equals one thousand kilogram. Sand and aggregates are typically measured in cubic feet (cubic feet) or cubic meters (meters cubed). So, if you are ordering sand for your construction, you might order one hundred cubic feet, which is roughly two point eight three meters cubed. Keep in mind that local vendors might use terms like \"tractor trolley,\" which is not a standard unit but refers to the amount of material a tractor trolley can carry."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, lengths are commonly expressed in feet (ft) or meters (m). A standard brick is around 9 inches x 4.5 inches x 3 inches, or roughly 23 cm x 11.4 cm x 7.6 cm. Pipe diameters are often given in inches (e.g., a 4-inch pipe), while the thickness of concrete slabs is usually specified in millimeters (mm) or inches. Always clarify which units the contractor is using to avoid any confusion and ensure accurate measurements during your construction project.", "normalised": "Finally, lengths are commonly expressed in feet (feet) or meters (meters). A standard brick is around nine inches by four point five inches by three inches, or roughly twenty three centimeter by eleven point four centimeter by seven point six centimeter.
