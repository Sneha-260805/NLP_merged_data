Steel bars, crucial for structural integrity, are up to ₹65,000 per metric ton. This is impacting construction timelines, as projects get delayed due to budget overruns.", "normalised": "Builders in Mumbai are facing challenges with rising material costs.

{"unnormalised": "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) requires all new buildings to adhere to strict safety standards, including the use of reinforced concrete with a minimum compressive strength of 30 MPa. The standard height of each floor is typically around 3 m, but this can vary depending on the project's purpose. Incorrect measurements or substandard materials can lead to serious structural failures.", "normalised": "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (B-M-C) requires all new buildings to adhere to strict safety standards, including the use of reinforced concrete with a minimum compressive strength of thirty M-P-A.

{"unnormalised": "Quantity surveyors are advising clients to factor in a wastage allowance of 5% for concrete and 8% for steel during the estimation phase. This helps to account for on-site losses and ensures adequate material is available. Additionally, proper site leveling is essential, with a tolerance of +/- 25 mm for the foundation.", "normalised": "Quantity surveyors are advising clients to factor in a wastage allowance of five percent for concrete and eight percent for steel during the estimation phase.

{"unnormalised": "For large infrastructure projects like bridges and flyovers, precise measurements are even more critical. A deviation of just a few millimeters in the length of a pre-stressed concrete girder can have significant consequences. These projects often require specialized equipment, such as laser levels and total stations, to ensure accuracy.", "normalised": "For large infrastructure projects like bridges and flyovers, precise measurements are even more critical.
