{"unnormalised": "Further complicating matters, different teams were using varying units of measurement. Some used the metric system (meters and kilometers), while others referenced older, local units like *hasta* and *angula*, leading to misinterpretations and errors during conversion. One engineer mentioned that “There were instances when tunnel depth was being planned in feet (ft) instead of meters. 5 ft difference may not look much on paper, but it makes huge differences in tunnel excavation.”", "normalised": "Further complicating matters, different teams were using varying units of measurement.
