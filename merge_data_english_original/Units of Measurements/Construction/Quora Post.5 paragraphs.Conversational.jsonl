{"unnormalised": "For land, in India, we usually talk about area. You’ll hear \"sq ft\" a lot, meaning square feet. Also common is \"sq m\", or square meters. A \"bigha\" is another unit, but it varies wildly depending on which state you're in! Seriously, a bigha in Rajasthan is different from a bigha in Assam. Conversions can get tricky, so always double-check. You also hear of \"acres\", especially when dealing with larger plots, where 1 acre is around 43,560 sq ft.", "normalised": "For land, in India, we usually talk about area.

{"unnormalised": "When it comes to the actual building, things get even more measurement-y. Brick sizes are often given in mm (millimeters). Think something like 230mm x 110mm x 75mm, but this can change depending on the type of brick. Cement and sand? That’s usually in kg (kilograms) or sometimes in cubic feet (cu ft) for larger quantities. Steel rods are measured by their diameter, usually in mm again, and their length, often in meters (m). For instance, 12mm steel bar of 6m length.", "normalised": "When it comes to the actual building, things get even more measurement-y. Brick sizes are often given in millimeters.

Knowing your area and desired thickness (in mm or cm - centimeters) helps you calculate the amount of concrete you'll need.
