{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me how much cement is needed per sq ft of brickwork. Well, it depends on a few things, bhai! Are you talking about 4.5-inch walls or 9-inch walls? That makes a big difference. Also, what ratio are you using? Standard is often 1:6 (cement:sand) but some contractors go for 1:4 if they want extra strength. Generally, for a 4.5-inch wall with a 1:6 mix, you'll need roughly 0.15 bags of cement per 100 sq ft.", "normalised": "Someone asked me how much cement is needed per square foot of brickwork.

Standard is often one to six (cement to sand) but some contractors go for one to four if they want extra strength. Generally, for a four point five inch wall with a one to six mix, you'll need roughly zero point one five bags of cement per one hundred square feet."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, that's just a rough estimate, okay? The actual amount can vary based on the brick size, the joint thickness (usually around 10 mm), and the skill of the mason. A good mason will minimize wastage. Also, remember to factor in the cement needed for the mortar bed. I'd suggest calculating it properly based on your specific project requirements. Don't just blindly follow these numbers!", "normalised": "Now, that's just a rough estimate, okay?

And always check the cement's manufacturing date; old cement loses its strength!
