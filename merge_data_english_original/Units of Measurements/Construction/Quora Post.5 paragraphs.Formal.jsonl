{"unnormalised": "\"Sq ft,\" of course, means square feet. However, builders in some areas still use older units like \"cent,\" \"ground,\" or \"biswa.\" A \"cent\" is usually around 435.6 sq ft, although this can vary regionally.

{"unnormalised": "When planning construction materials, the primary units are often weight and volume. Cement is almost always sold by weight. A standard cement bag weighs 50 kg. You will need to specify the required volume of sand and aggregates, frequently quoted in cubic feet or cubic meters. For example, \"3 cum\" refers to 3 cubic meters. Reinforcement steel is also ordered by weight, usually in tonnes, where 1 tonne is equivalent to 1000 kg.", "normalised": "When planning construction materials, the primary units are often weight and volume.
