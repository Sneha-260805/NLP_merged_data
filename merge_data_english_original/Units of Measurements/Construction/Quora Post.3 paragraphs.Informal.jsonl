{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, newbie builder here! I'm planning a small extension to my house in Bangalore, and I'm getting quotes from contractors. It's all a bit confusing with the units of measurement they're using. One guy quoted Rs. 2500 per sq ft for construction, while another said Rs. 2.8 lakh for the whole thing which he estimated as 100 sq m. How do I even compare these?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, newbie builder here! I am planning a small extension to my house in Bangalore, and I am getting quotes from contractors.

{"unnormalised": "Also, they keep talking about \"cent\" for land area. My property document says my land is 1200 sq ft, but the contractor mentioned something about 2.75 cents. Is there a standard conversion I should know? Plus, I'm seeing different cement bag sizes - some are 50 kg, others say 20 kg. It's like they're deliberately trying to confuse me! Any advice on how to make sense of all this and get a fair deal?", "normalised": "Also, they keep talking about \"cent\" for land area.

It would be great if someone can break down the most common units of measurement used in construction in India so I don’t get ripped off.
