{"unnormalised": "The increase in material costs will likely have a cascading effect on the real estate sector, potentially leading to higher property prices and delays in project completion. The cost of constructing a standard 2BHK flat, measuring approximately 800 sq ft, is estimated to have increased by 8-10%. Smaller contractors and individual home builders are particularly vulnerable to these price fluctuations.", "normalised": "The increase in material costs will likely have a cascading effect on the real estate sector, potentially leading to higher property prices and delays in project completion.
