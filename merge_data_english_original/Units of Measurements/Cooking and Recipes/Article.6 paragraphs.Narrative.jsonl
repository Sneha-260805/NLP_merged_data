{"unnormalised": "Of course, now that I'm trying to recreate her recipes, I realize the challenge. I once tried making her chai, following her verbal instructions. \"Take about 500 ml of water, add 2 tsp of tea leaves, a small piece of ginger maybe around 1 inch, and a good splash of milk, around 1/4 litre\", she had said. The result? A watery, weak concoction that tasted nothing like hers. I learned then that her \"small piece\" of ginger was actually quite generous, and her \"splash\" of milk was more like half a cup.", "normalised": "Of course, now that I'm trying to recreate her recipes, I realize the challenge.

A pinch of turmeric, a dash of garam masala, a \"little\" bit of this and that, judged by the color, the aroma, the texture.

{"unnormalised": "Despite my initial frustrations, I’m beginning to appreciate her method. It’s less about precise scientific formulas and more about connecting with the food, using your intuition.
