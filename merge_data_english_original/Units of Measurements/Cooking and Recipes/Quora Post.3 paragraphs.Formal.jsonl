{"unnormalised": "Scaling recipes can be tricky, but it's mostly about ratios and careful calculations. First, determine the scaling factor. In your case, it's 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3 or approx. 0.67. Multiply each ingredient quantity by this factor. For example, if the original recipe calls for 300g of flour, you'll need approximately 200g (300g * 0.67) for 4 servings. For liquids, convert to ml if needed (e.g., 1 cup of milk = 240ml) before multiplying.", "normalised": "Scaling recipes can be tricky, but it is mostly about ratios and careful calculations. First, determine the scaling factor. In your case, it is four divided by six, which simplifies to two divided by three or approximately zero point six seven. Multiply each ingredient quantity by this factor. For example, if the original recipe calls for three hundred gram of flour, you will need approximately two hundred gram (three hundred gram asterisk zero point six seven) for four servings. For liquids, convert to milliliter if needed (for example, one cup of milk equals two hundred and forty milliliter) before multiplying."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, consider any necessary adjustments. Oven temperature and cooking time might need slight tweaking, especially for baked goods. Generally, a slightly lower temperature might be needed (reducing by maybe 10-15 degrees C) and check for doneness a little earlier than stated in the recipe. Small measurements like 1/4 tsp salt might not need an exact calculation; just use a pinch less. Also, think about the pan size. If the recipe originally calls for a 9-inch pan, scaling down for 4 might require an 8-inch pan, to maintain the correct depth.", "normalised": "Next, consider any necessary adjustments. Oven temperature and cooking time might need slight tweaking, especially for baked goods. Generally, a slightly lower temperature might be needed (reducing by maybe ten to fifteen degree Celsius) and check for doneness a little earlier than stated in the recipe. Small measurements like one divided by four teaspoon salt might not need an exact calculation; just use a pinch less. Also, think about the pan size. If the recipe originally calls for a nine inch pan, scaling down for four might require an eight inch pan, to maintain the correct depth."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember that some aspects of cooking are more art than science. Taste as you go! After scaling, a dish may require minor adjustments to seasoning. For example, adding an extra 1g of chilli powder, or 2 ml of lemon juice can enhance the flavour. Consider starting with slightly less of strong spices and then adjust upwards based on your preference. Always maintain the ratio of dry to wet ingredients.", "normalised": "Finally, remember that some aspects of cooking are more art than science. Taste as you go!
