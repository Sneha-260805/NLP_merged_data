{"unnormalised": "Also, another question. The recipe also says to \"simmer on low heat for 30 mins\". My stove only has settings like \"high,\" \"medium,\" and \"apna time aayega\" (just kidding...mostly!). Which one is closest to low? And what if I use a pressure cooker instead? Will it take only 10 mins then? I'm scared of exploding biryani. BTW, I also forgot to measure the oil, poured like 100 ml straight from the bottle...oops!", "normalised": "Also, another question.
