I’d been putting it off for ages, mostly because the whole deep-frying thing scared me. Plus, all the measurements seemed so...precise. I mean, who actually measures rose water in mL these days?", "normalised": "Okay, so yesterday I decided to try my hand at making Gulab Jamun.

{"unnormalised": "The recipe card, yellowed and slightly stained with what I suspect is saffron (kesar), called for 250 gms of khoya. Finding good quality khoya was the first challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Next, the maida. Dadi’s recipe specified 100 gms of maida. Fine, I thought, relatively straightforward. Then came the baking powder - just 1/2 tsp. See, this is where I start questioning my abilities. What's half a teaspoon even?! I eyeballed it, probably added a bit more than I should have, but hey, what’s life without a little risk, right?", "normalised": "Next, the maida. Dadi's recipe specified one hundred grams of maida.

{"unnormalised": "Mixing everything together was surprisingly therapeutic. Kneading the dough until it reached the right consistency – soft, pliable, not too sticky. Dadi always said the secret was in the kneading. Once the dough was ready, I rolled them into small balls, about 2 cm in diameter.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the dreaded frying part. I heated the oil, carefully maintaining the temperature at around 150°C. Too hot, and the Gulab Jamuns would burn on the outside and stay raw inside. Too cold, and they'd soak up all the oil. It was a delicate balancing act. The first few went in, sizzled gently, and slowly turned a beautiful golden brown. Success! I pulled them out, carefully placing them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. Each batch took approximately 5 mins.", "normalised": "Then came the dreaded frying part. I heated the oil, carefully maintaining the temperature at around one hundred and fifty degree celsius.

{"unnormalised": "While the Gulab Jamuns cooled slightly, I prepared the sugar syrup. The recipe called for 500 gms of sugar dissolved in 2 cups of water, flavored with cardamom pods and a generous splash of rose water (probably around 50 mL, if I had to guess). I simmered it until it reached a slightly sticky consistency, perfect for soaking the Gulab Jamuns.", "normalised": "While the Gulab Jamuns cooled slightly, I prepared the sugar syrup.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the moment of truth. I gently placed the fried Gulab Jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. They bobbed there, soaking up all the sweetness. Dadi always said to let them soak for at least 2 hours, but honestly, who can wait that long? I sneaked one out after 30 minutes. It was heavenly. Soft, spongy, dripping with sweetness. Maybe, just maybe, I’m getting the hang of this whole cooking thing. Now to figure out how many calories each one is.. probably at least 200 cal per piece!
