{"unnormalised": "It all started innocently enough. I decided to tackle dal makhani, because, you know, how hard could it be? Famous last words. I opened the recipe, and the first thing I saw was \"1 cup of urad dal.\" One CUP? What kind of precise nonsense is this? Back in my grandmother's day, they probably just eyeballed it. Still, I dug out my measuring cup, feeling very scientific. Turns out, \"1 cup\" is a lot more dal than I thought.
