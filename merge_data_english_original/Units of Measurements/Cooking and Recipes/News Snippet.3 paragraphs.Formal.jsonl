{"unnormalised": "New Delhi: Concerns have been raised regarding inaccuracies in recipe conversions frequently encountered in online culinary platforms. A recent study highlighted that many recipes listed online suffer from discrepancies in units of measurements. For instance, conversions between grams (g) and ounces (oz), or milliliters (ml) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are often imprecise, leading to inconsistent results for home cooks. Experts at the National Institute of Nutrition emphasize the importance of accurate measurements, especially when baking.", "normalised": "New Delhi: Concerns have been raised regarding inaccuracies in recipe conversions frequently encountered in online culinary platforms.

{"unnormalised": "The study analyzed over 500 online recipes and found that approximately 20% contained at least one unit conversion error. Common errors included equating 1 cup of flour to 150 g in one recipe but to 120 g in another. Similarly, discrepancies were noted in the volume conversions for liquids, where 1 liter (L) was sometimes erroneously converted to values other than 1000 ml. This inconsistency affects the taste and texture of the dishes.", "normalised": "The study analyzed over five hundred online recipes and found that approximately twenty percent contained at least one unit conversion error. Common errors included equating one cup of flour to one hundred and fifty grams in one recipe but to one hundred and twenty grams in another. Similarly, discrepancies were noted in the volume conversions for liquids, where one liter was sometimes erroneously converted to values other than one thousand milliliter. This inconsistency affects the taste and texture of the dishes."}

Cross-referencing measurement guides from trusted sources is also recommended to avoid potential pitfalls arising from misleading online recipe instructions. Moreover, standardization of units in online recipes is needed to improve culinary outcomes for cooks across India.", "normalised": "Authorities are advising cooks to use digital kitchen scales capable of switching between metric (for example, kilogram, gram) and imperial (for example, pound, ounce) units for higher accuracy.
