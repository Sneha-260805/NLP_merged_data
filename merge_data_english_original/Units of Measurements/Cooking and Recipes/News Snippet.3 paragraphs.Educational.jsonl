{"unnormalised": "New research from the National Institute of Nutrition sheds light on common measurement inaccuracies in Indian kitchens. A study published this week highlights that many home cooks often misjudge quantities, particularly when using traditional measuring tools. For instance, a \"katori\" (small bowl) of dal might range from 150 grams to 200 gm depending on its depth and diameter. This variance can significantly impact nutritional intake, especially for those managing specific dietary requirements.", "normalised": "New research from the N-A-T-I-O-N-A-L Institute of Nutrition sheds light on common measurement inaccuracies in Indian kitchens. A study published this week highlights that many home cooks often misjudge quantities, particularly when using traditional measuring tools. For instance, a \"katori\" (small bowl) of dal might range from one hundred and fifty grams to two hundred grams depending on its depth and diameter. This variance can significantly impact nutritional intake, especially for those managing specific dietary requirements."}
{"unnormalised": "The study emphasizes the importance of using standardized measuring cups and spoons, especially for baking and precise cooking. Many Indian recipes call for ingredients in \"chammach\" (spoonfuls) or \"mutthi\" (handfuls), which are inherently inconsistent. A \"tablespoon\" (15 ml) of oil can easily become 20 ml if heaped, adding unnecessary calories. Similarly, using \"one glass\" of rice can be misleading, as glass sizes vary widely. The researchers suggest that converting to standard units of measurement, like grams or milliliters, can improve accuracy and consistency in recipes.", "normalised": "The study emphasizes the importance of using standardized measuring cups and spoons, especially for baking and precise cooking. Many Indian recipes call for ingredients in \"chammach\" (spoonfuls) or \"mutthi\" (handfuls), which are inherently inconsistent. A \"tablespoon\" (fifteen milliliter) of oil can easily become twenty milliliter if heaped, adding unnecessary calories.

{"unnormalised": "The institute also released a free online guide with conversions and tips for using standard measurements in popular Indian recipes. Simple changes, like weighing flour (1 cup ≈ 120 gms) instead of estimating its volume, can lead to more predictable results and healthier meals. Understanding the difference between fluid ounces (fl oz) and weight ounces (oz) when measuring liquids is also crucial. By adopting these practices, home cooks can ensure they are following recipes accurately and managing their family's nutritional needs effectively.", "normalised": "The institute also released a free online guide with conversions and tips for using standard measurements in popular Indian recipes.
