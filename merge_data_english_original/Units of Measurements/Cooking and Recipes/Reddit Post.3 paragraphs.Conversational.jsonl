{"unnormalised": "Guys, I'm trying out this new biryani recipe I found online, and I'm already confused! It says to add 250 gms of basmati rice, but then calls for 750 ml of water. Does that sound right? Seems like a lot of water for that little rice, no? My mom always makes it by 'andaaz' (estimation), never measures anything precisely, but I wanted to try doing it exactly by the recipe this time.", "normalised": "Guys, I am trying out this new biryani recipe I found online, and I am already confused!

{"unnormalised": "Also, another thing – it mentions using 2 tsp of garam masala, but the garam masala I bought from the local store feels super strong. Should I reduce it to 1.5 tsp, or maybe even 1 tsp? Don't want it to overpower the whole dish. The recipe claims it serves 4 people, but looking at the quantities of chicken (500 g) and rice, I'm thinking it might be enough for 6. What are your experiences with recipe serving sizes?", "normalised": "Also, another thing – it mentions using two teaspoon of garam masala, but the garam masala I bought from the local store feels super strong.

{"unnormalised": "Any tips would be appreciated! I'm hoping to get this right for dinner tonight. Wish me luck! Gonna need it, haha. This is way harder than just winging it like my mom does. Oh, and it says to cook it on low heat for 30 mins, but my stove runs kinda hot. Should I check it after 25 mins maybe? Arrey yaar, so many questions!", "normalised": "Any tips would be appreciated!
