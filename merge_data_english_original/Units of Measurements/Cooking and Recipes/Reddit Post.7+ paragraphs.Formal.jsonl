{"unnormalised": "Many recipes call for ingredients in terms of \"tola,\" a traditional unit of weight. I understand that 1 tola is approximately 11.66 grams. Is this conversion universally accepted, or are there regional variations in the value of a tola? Furthermore, I've come across recipes that specify quantities in \"chatak.\" I've found online that 1 chatak is about 58.3 grams, which would be 5 tolas, but confirmation would be greatly appreciated. Beyond grams, how can I convert that to say, ounces if a recipe is being shared internationally?", "normalised": "Many recipes call for ingredients in terms of \"tola,\" a traditional unit of weight.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of difficulty lies in volumetric measurements. Recipes frequently use \"katori\" or \"cup.\" Is there a generally accepted volume for a standard katori? I've seen estimates ranging from 150ml to 200ml. Then there's the ubiquitous \"pinch\" or \"chutki.\" This appears to be subjective. What would be a reasonable approximation in terms of teaspoons or milligrams for a pinch of salt or turmeric? How much does the density of the substance being measure matter? I imagine a \"pinch\" of asafetida would differ greatly from a \"pinch\" of chili powder.", "normalised": "Another area of difficulty lies in volumetric measurements.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to spices, some recipes call for spices in terms of \"masha.\" From what I have gathered, 1 masha is approximately 0.972 grams. How accurate is this generally?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the common direction to cook over \"slow flame\" versus \"high flame.\" How can these instructions be rendered more objectively? Could approximate temperature ranges in Celsius or Fahrenheit be assigned to these terms? For instance, could “slow flame” be reasonably interpreted as 120°C to 150°C?

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, many recipes involving liquids use terms like \"aadha pao.\" My research suggests that 1 pao is around 250 ml, meaning that aadha pao would be roughly 125 ml.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, when it comes to oven temperatures, many older Indian recipes simply state \"bake until golden brown.\" How can I translate this to a more precise temperature and time setting for modern ovens? I also have trouble converting between convection and conventional oven temperatures.
