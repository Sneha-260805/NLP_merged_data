{"unnormalised": "New Delhi: Concerns are mounting amongst culinary professionals regarding the increasing discrepancies observed in ingredient measurements across various online recipe platforms. A recent study conducted by the Indian Institute of Culinary Arts found that nearly 35% of recipes tested exhibited significant variations in quantities specified, leading to inconsistent and often unsatisfactory results. This has raised questions about the standardization of units of measurement in the digital age.", "normalised": "New Delhi: Concerns are mounting amongst culinary professionals regarding the increasing discrepancies observed in ingredient measurements across various online recipe platforms. A recent study conducted by the Indian Institute of Culinary Arts found that nearly thirty five percent of recipes tested exhibited significant variations in quantities specified, leading to inconsistent and often unsatisfactory results. This has raised questions about the standardization of units of measurement in the digital age."}
{"unnormalised": "The research highlighted inconsistencies in the use of cups, teaspoons, and tablespoons, especially when converting between US customary units and the metric system. For example, a recipe calling for \"1 cup\" of flour could result in a variance of up to 20 grams depending on the measuring cup used, which is concerning because 20 gms can mean the difference between great baked goods and poorly baked ones. This issue is exacerbated by the globalization of culinary content, where recipes originally developed using one system of measurement are often translated without proper conversion, the conversion rate of milliliters to fluid ounces being the biggest pain point.", "normalised": "The research highlighted inconsistencies in the use of cups, teaspoons, and tablespoons, especially when converting between U-S customary units and the metric system.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the study pointed out ambiguities in volume measurements for liquids. While \"1 ml\" of water is universally defined, the same cannot be said for thicker liquids like honey or molasses, where density variations can significantly impact the actual quantity used. A standard \"tsp\" of honey is very different from a standard \"tsp\" of water, and this poses great problems. Experts recommend using weight measurements (grams) whenever possible to ensure accuracy and consistency.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the study pointed out ambiguities in volume measurements for liquids.

Many home cooks rely on online resources for their culinary guidance, and the lack of standardized measurements can lead to frustration and food waste.
