{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, I was just on the phone with my Dadi (that's grandma for you non-Hindi speakers!), and we were talking about her amazing aloo parathas. And honestly, trying to follow her recipe is like decoding ancient Sanskrit. Everything is in “a pinch of this” and “a handful of that.” Seriously, a handful to *who*? My giant paws or her petite ones?!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "It got me thinking – how many of us actually understand cooking measurements beyond, like, the standard cup and spoon? Because let’s be real, when Dadi says “add ½ adrak,” she means add half an inch of ginger. I asked her to elaborate! She measured the ginger with a ruler and asked me to note it.", "normalised": "It got me thinking – how many of us actually understand cooking measurements beyond, like, the standard cup and spoon?

I have found that a standard tea cup is about 180 ml, so keep that in mind if you have to guesstimate. I use that when I'm baking cakes. Also, the perfect consistency of Dahi is not too thick and not too watery.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole thing with volume.

{"unnormalised": "The other day, I was making chai and the recipe called for \"1 tsp\" of elaichi powder. Turned out my teaspoon was HUGE! The chai tasted like pure cardamom.

{"unnormalised": "So, the next time you’re tackling a traditional recipe, don’t be afraid to ask for clarifications! Or, you know, just wing it. That’s what I usually do. After all, cooking is all about experimenting… and sometimes ending up with hilariously inedible results. I will give you an updated recipe from Grandma soon!
