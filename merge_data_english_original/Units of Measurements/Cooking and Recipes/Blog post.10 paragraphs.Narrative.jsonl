{"unnormalised": "My early attempts at chai were, let's just say, experiments in culinary disaster. One time, I added 200 ml of milk to what was supposed to be a strong, black tea and ended up with something that resembled dishwater. Another time, I got carried away with the ginger, grating a whole 50 g piece into a small saucepan - it was spicy enough to make a grown man cry!", "normalised": "My early attempts at chai were, let's just say, experiments in culinary disaster.

{"unnormalised": "So, I started experimenting. I began with a base of 1 tsp of tea leaves per cup of water. I found that using 1.5 g of good quality Assam tea gave me the perfect strength. It's amazing how such a small amount can make such a big difference.", "normalised": "So, I started experimenting. I began with a base of one teaspoon of tea leaves per cup of water.

{"unnormalised": "Milk was another challenge. Too much, and the chai became bland. Too little, and it was bitter. Eventually, I settled on a ratio of 1:3, milk to water. So, for every 100 ml of water, I would add 300 ml of milk. It created a creamy, rich texture that was just divine.", "normalised": "Milk was another challenge. Too much, and the chai became bland. Too little, and it was bitter. Eventually, I settled on a ratio of one to three, milk to water. So, for every one hundred milliliter of water, I would add three hundred milliliter of milk. It created a creamy, rich texture that was just divine."}
{"unnormalised": "Sugar was a tricky one, too. I tried using a sugar substitute, but it never tasted quite right. Finally, I decided that a small indulgence was worth it. 1 tbsp of sugar per cup of chai seemed to hit the sweet spot. Although, sometimes, on a particularly sweet-craving day, I'd bump it up to 15g.", "normalised": "Sugar was a tricky one, too. I tried using a sugar substitute, but it never tasted quite right.

{"unnormalised": "For the spices, I discovered that less is more. A small piece of ginger, about 2 cm long, grated finely, was perfect. A pinch of cardamom, around 0.25 tsp, added a subtle aroma that filled the whole kitchen.

{"unnormalised": "Over time, I've adapted my chai recipe depending on my mood and the weather. On a rainy Mumbai morning, I might add an extra 0.5 cm of ginger to warm me up.

And who knows, you might even discover your own secret ingredient, measured just so.
