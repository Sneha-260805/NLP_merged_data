A whole damn tablespoon because my \"thoda sa\" is usually way more than the average person's. Then there’s \"ek chutki\" saffron. Again, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?! My chutki is bigger than my roommate's pinky. Precision is key for a perfect biryani, people. It shouldn't be a guessing game!", "normalised": "So, the recipe calls for \"thoda sa\" garam masala.
