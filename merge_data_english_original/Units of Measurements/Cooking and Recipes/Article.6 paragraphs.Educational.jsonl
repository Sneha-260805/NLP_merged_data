{"unnormalised": "Let's start with volume. \"Ek cup\" is a very common instruction, but what size cup? Generally, a standard measuring cup is considered to be 240 ml. However, you might also encounter \"katori\" (bowl) measurements. A standard \"katori\" usually holds around 150-180 ml. It's important to remember that these are approximate, so using a set of standardized measuring cups from your local store is advisable for consistent results, especially when baking. For liquids like milk or water, older recipes may even specify measurements like \"1 bottle,\" which, depending on the region, might be anywhere from 500 ml to 750 ml.", "normalised": "Let us start with volume. \"Ek cup\" is a very common instruction, but what size cup? Generally, a standard measuring cup is considered to be two hundred and forty milliliter. However, you might also encounter \"katori\" (bowl) measurements.

{"unnormalised": "Weight measurements also have regional variations. While \"gram\" is commonly used, \"tola\" is another historical unit you might find, particularly in older recipes or when discussing gold. 1 tola is approximately equal to 11.66 grams. Another important measure is the \"pav,\" commonly used for buying vegetables and spices. One pav equals 250 grams. For larger quantities, the \"kilogram\" (kg), equivalent to 1000 grams, is standard. Remember, using a digital kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially with baking, where precision is key.", "normalised": "Weight measurements also have regional variations.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to length, you won't often find length measurements directly in recipes, but they are crucial in understanding cooking techniques. For instance, \"roti\" thickness might be described as \"1/4 inch\" or \"as thin as a paper dosa.\" While not a precise measurement, it provides a visual cue for the desired outcome. \"Finger width\" is also sometimes used to describe the size of diced vegetables, providing another relative measure. The size of a pan or pot, often referred to in inches (e.g., a \"9-inch pan\"), can greatly impact the cooking time.", "normalised": "Moving on to length, you will not often find length measurements directly in recipes, but they are crucial in understanding cooking techniques.

{"unnormalised": "Temperature measurements in Indian cooking have become more standardized, with Celsius (°C) being the common unit. Most modern ovens and cooking appliances use Celsius. However, older recipes, particularly those translated from western sources, might still refer to Fahrenheit (°F). For example, a baking recipe might call for an oven temperature of 350°F, which is roughly equivalent to 175°C. So, converting Fahrenheit to Celsius and using a cooking thermometer ensures the best results, when accuracy is important.", "normalised": "Temperature measurements in Indian cooking have become more standardized, with Celsius (degree C) being the common unit.
