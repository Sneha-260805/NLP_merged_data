{"unnormalised": "So, the recipe calls for \"2 handfuls of basmati rice.\" Okay, fine. I went with what *I* thought was a reasonable handful. Which, let's be honest, is probably closer to 3 handfuls by anyone else's standards. Then it says, \"a pinch of saffron.\" A PINCH! Whose pinch are we talking about here? A pinch like my dainty aunties take when they are dieting? or my bear-sized chacha who uses pinches like handfuls. I ended up adding a tiny smidgen. Probably not enough.", "normalised": "So, the recipe calls for \"two handfuls of basmati rice.\" Okay, fine. I went with what I thought was a reasonable handful.

{"unnormalised": "Next, the recipe specified “2 chammach (tablespoons) of ginger-garlic paste”. Now, i thought i had it sorted. Grams, mLs, and the mighty chammach – so far so good. I merrily added 2 heaps of “ginger-garlic paste” as specified in the recipe. Only when it started to taste a little too gingery did I bother checking how big my chammach really was.

Now i am not a physics expert, but can someone please tell me why the oil needed to submerge the sesame seeds to make biryani is a consistent quantity. And does the oil even need to submerge it - wont the seeds come up? And if i am using mustard oil does that make a difference. I mean my brain hurts now trying to think about this so i poured about 100 mL of the oil.", "normalised": "And finally, the amount of oil!
