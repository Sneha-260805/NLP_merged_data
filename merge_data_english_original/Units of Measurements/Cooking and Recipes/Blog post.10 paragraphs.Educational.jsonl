Ever wondered why your grandma’s or nani’s recipes always seem to taste better? A big part of it is her innate understanding of measurements, often without relying on precise tools. But for us modern cooks, getting a handle on units of measurement is key to consistent and delicious Indian dishes. Let's dive into the colorful world of cooking measurements."}
{"unnormalised": "**Cooking Up a Storm: Understanding Measurements in the Indian Kitchen**", "normalised": "First off, let's talk volume. We often see recipes calling for \"one cup\" of dal or \"half cup\" of rice. In the Indian context, this typically refers to a standard measuring cup, which holds approximately two hundred and forty milliliter. However, many home cooks still use their katori, bowl, as a measuring device! So, one katori may not always equal two hundred and forty milliliter; it varies. It's a good idea to standardize your katori sizes or invest in a good measuring cup set. Some older recipes might even use \"one pao\" - an old unit that approximates to about two hundred grams."}
