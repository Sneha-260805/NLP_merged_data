{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, quick question for all the tailors (or aspiring ones) out there! I'm trying to figure out how much fabric I need for a simple salwar kameez. The fabric shop guy was quoting in meters, but my aunt was going on about yards. Total confusion! Anyone got a reliable conversion guide, maybe something in cms or inches too? Like, if I want a 2.5 meter kameez, how many yards is that exactly?", "normalised": "Hey guys, quick question for all the tailors or aspiring ones out there!

{"unnormalised": "Also, any tips on accounting for shrinkage? I'm using cotton, and I've heard horror stories of clothes shrinking by a whole inch or two after the first wash. Should I just buy extra fabric, like another 0.5 meter? Or is there a more scientific way to calculate it? My mom suggested pre-washing, but I'm worried about messing up the fabric before I even start.", "normalised": "Also, any tips on accounting for shrinkage?

Any advice on which system is less prone to errors when measuring and cutting? I’m planning on stitching on my own so any tips will be highly appreciated.
