{"unnormalised": "In the Indian tailoring industry, several units of measurement are frequently employed. The most common unit is the inch (in), used for measuring lengths, widths, and circumferences of fabric and body parts. For larger lengths, the foot (ft) or yard (yd) might be used, especially when calculating the total fabric needed for a garment. While the metric system is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially with younger tailors, the older generation often prefers and uses the traditional imperial units.", "normalised": "In the Indian tailoring industry, several units of measurement are frequently employed.

{"unnormalised": "Another unit of significance is the 'gaj', which is equivalent to one yard. Seam allowances are usually measured in fractions of an inch (e.g., 1/4 in, 1/2 in), ensuring precision in stitching. Furthermore, 'booti' is sometimes used to denote small lengths, though it's less standardized. Tailors are also increasingly incorporating centimeters (cm) and meters (m) into their practice, especially when working with international patterns or designs demanding higher accuracy in metrics.", "normalised": "Another unit of significance is the 'gaj', which is equivalent to one yard.

{"unnormalised": "Therefore, while inches, feet, and yards are the traditional mainstays, centimeters and meters are gradually gaining acceptance. This blend of imperial and metric units is a characteristic feature of contemporary tailoring practices in India. A skilled tailor must be proficient in converting between these measurement systems to effectively cater to diverse client preferences and design specifications, regardless of the measurement specified during consult.", "normalised": "Therefore, while inches, feet, and yards are the traditional mainstays, centimeters and meters are gradually gaining acceptance.
