{"unnormalised": "Ah, tailoring! That ancient art, that delicate dance between fabric, thread, and the existential dread of realizing you’ve eaten too much biryani. As someone who once tried to hem my own saree and ended up with a wearable abstract sculpture, I approach tailoring with a healthy dose of respect… and a fully charged phone for emergency calls to my local darzi.", "normalised": "ah, tailoring! that ancient art, that delicate dance between fabric, thread, and the existential dread of realizing you’ve eaten too much biryani. as someone who once tried to hem my own saree and ended up with a wearable abstract sculpture, I approach tailoring with a healthy dose of respect… and a fully charged phone for emergency calls to my local darzi."}
{"unnormalised": "Let’s talk measurements, shall we? We're dealing with a chaotic symphony of cm and inches, a veritable Tower of Babel for the uninitiated. You walk into the shop, hoping for a well-fitting kurta, only to be bombarded with numbers like: \"Shoulder: 16 inches, Chest: 38 inches, Sleeve length: 24 inches. Wait, what was the question again?” The darzi, a seasoned pro, scribbles these figures with the speed of a formula one racer jotting down lap times, seemingly unaffected by your blank stare.", "normalised": "let’s talk measurements, shall we? we're dealing with a chaotic symphony of centimeter and inches, a veritable tower of babel for the uninitiated. you walk into the shop, hoping for a well-fitting kurta, only to be bombarded with numbers like: \"shoulder: sixteen inches, chest: thirty eight inches, sleeve length: twenty four inches. wait, what was the question again?” the darzi, a seasoned pro, scribbles these figures with the speed of a formula one racer jotting down lap times, seemingly unaffected by your blank stare."}
{"unnormalised": "And then there's the magical transformation. You bring in your favourite pair of jeans, the ones that fit *just* right, and ask for a replica. \"Exactly the same, please!\" you plead. A week later, you return, only to discover that the new jeans, while technically *jeans*, are mysteriously shorter by, say, 2cm and tighter around the waist by a baffling 1 inch. The explanation? A shrug, a smile, and the age-old tailoring mantra: \"Sir, *slightly* different fabric. *Very* difficult to copy perfectly.\" Right.", "normalised": "and then there's the magical transformation. you bring in your favourite pair of jeans, the ones that fit just right, and ask for a replica. \"exactly the same, please!\" you plead. a week later, you return, only to discover that the new jeans, while technically jeans, are mysteriously shorter by, say, two centimeter and tighter around the waist by a baffling one inch. the explanation? a shrug, a smile, and the age-old tailoring mantra: \"sir, slightly different fabric. very difficult to copy perfectly.\" right."}
{"unnormalised": "Speaking of fabric, the sheer variety is enough to make your head spin. You’ve got everything from gossamer-thin chiffon measured in gms to sturdy cotton measured in…well, I’m not entirely sure how cotton is measured, but I’m guessing it involves a scale and a knowing nod. Trying to explain the *exact* drape you want to a tailor is like trying to describe the color of the sky to someone who's never seen it. \"Flowy, but not *too* flowy, you know? Like…water, but on land. Yes! Exactly!\" Good luck with that, bhai.", "normalised": "speaking of fabric, the sheer variety is enough to make your head spin. you’ve got everything from gossamer-thin chiffon measured in grams to sturdy cotton measured in…well, I’m not entirely sure how cotton is measured, but I’m guessing it involves a scale and a knowing nod. trying to explain the exact drape you want to a tailor is like trying to describe the color of the sky to someone who's never seen it. \"flowy, but not too flowy, you know? like…water, but on land. yes! exactly!\" good luck with that, bhai."}

{"unnormalised": "And finally, the fitting room. A cramped space, often dimly lit, where you contort yourself into unnatural positions while the tailor circles you like a hawk, armed with pins and pronouncements. \"A little loose here, a little tight there. We'll fix it, don't worry!\" he declares, before vanishing into the back, leaving you wondering if you'll ever escape the pin-cushioned purgatory. He might ask you your height too. 5'8\", you reply confidently. He looks you up and down, head to toe. \"No, beta, you're 5'6\" only!\". You protest, but he already has the tape measure out, proving you wrong by a whole two inches.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the chaos and the occasional sizing snafu, there’s something deeply satisfying about a well-tailored garment. It's a testament to the skill of the darzi, the patience of the customer, and the enduring power of fabric to transform from a flat piece of cloth into something that flatters the figure. It's like owning a custom work of art! Just remember to bring your sense of humour… and maybe a tape measure of your own. You know, just in case those inches decide to go missing again. Because you might ask for 40\", but in the end, you're just going to get whatever the tailor *wants* to give you.", "normalised": "despite the chaos and the occasional sizing snafu, there’s something deeply satisfying about a well-tailored garment. it's a testament to the skill of the darzi, the patience of the customer, and the enduring power of fabric to transform from a flat piece of cloth into something that flatters the figure. it's like owning a custom work of art! just remember to bring your sense of humour… and maybe a tape measure of your own. you know, just in case those inches decide to go missing again. because you might ask for forty inches, but in the end, you're just going to get whatever the tailor wants to give you."}
