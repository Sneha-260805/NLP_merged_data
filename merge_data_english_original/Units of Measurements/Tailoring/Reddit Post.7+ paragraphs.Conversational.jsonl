{"unnormalised": "I went to a local fabric shop in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, and the shopkeeper was rattling off things like \"3 meters for the kurta, 1.5 meters for the salwar\" – all good, I get that. Then he started talking about the \"shoulder width in inches\" and the \"sleeve length in cms\"… Why can't we just stick to one system? It's so confusing to convert everything on the fly, especially when I’m trying to imagine how the final product will look. My tailor even uses \"haath\" (roughly .5 meter) sometimes!", "normalised": "I went to a local fabric shop in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, and the shopkeeper was rattling off things like \"three meters for the kurta, one point five meters for the salwar\" – all good, I get that.

One uses inches for everything, another mixes inches and centimeters, and a third uses some weird fractions that I haven't seen since 8th grade math class.

{"unnormalised": "It's frustrating because I really want to learn this craft, but all the unit conversions are making it feel like I'm back in school solving physics problems.

{"unnormalised": "Is anyone else facing similar issues? Any tips or tricks for dealing with the madness of tailoring measurements? Should I just stick to using one unit and convert everything else to that? Maybe I should invest in a fancy measuring tape that does all the conversions for me.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, how important are super precise measurements anyway? Like, if I'm off by a millimeter or two, is it going to ruin the whole garment? Or is there some wiggle room for error?
