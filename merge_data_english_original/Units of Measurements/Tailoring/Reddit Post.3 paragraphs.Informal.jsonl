{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, I'm trying to get into tailoring, and I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the different units of measurement! Like, everyone keeps saying \"use inches\" but then I see patterns in \"cm\" and I'm totally lost. Any tips for a newbie? Is it better to just stick to 1 system, like always measuring in mm or is mixing units a part of the game? Plus, my measuring tape only goes up to 60 inches lol, what if I need to measure something bigger, like for a saree blouse which needs about 80 cm just for the waist?", "normalised": "Hey guys, I am trying to get into tailoring, and I am a bit overwhelmed by all the different units of measurement!

{"unnormalised": "Also, what's up with all the different fabric weights? I saw one online that was something like 150 GSM. What does that even mean? And is that heavy or light? I’m trying to make a simple kurta, and the shop guy suggested 2.5 meters of cotton. But the other day I was at my Nani's place and she mentioned using gaz for measuring cloth back in the day. Is gaz still a thing, or am I showing my age by even asking? Feeling like I need a conversion chart tattooed on my arm at this point!", "normalised": "Also, what is up with all the different fabric weights?

{"unnormalised": "Basically, is there a secret tailoring cheat sheet I should know about? Are there any super important units to memorise above the rest, and how much padding do I actually need to consider with regards to things like seam allowance? I’ve watched some tutorials online but they seem to fly over this stuff, so I’d really appreciate any help.
