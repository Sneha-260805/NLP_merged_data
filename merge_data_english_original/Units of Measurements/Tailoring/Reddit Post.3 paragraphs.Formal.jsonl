{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit, I'm seeking some insights on standardized measurement usage within the tailoring industry here in India. My observations suggest a mix of metric and imperial units depending on the tailor’s experience and location. For example, I’ve seen older tailors in Chennai quote measurements in inches (\"36-inch chest\") and yards for fabric (say, \"2.5 yards for a saree blouse\"), whereas some younger professionals primarily use centimeters or meters. Is this a widespread phenomenon?", "normalised": "Hey Reddit, I am seeking some insights on standardized measurement usage within the tailoring industry here in India.
