{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me about the fabric needed for a simple kurta, and honestly, my brain did a little bhangra. It’s like asking how long is a piece of string, bhai! Depends on so many things! Roughly, for an average adult (say, someone who's 5'6\" or around 168 cm tall) you're looking at maybe 2.5 meters if you're buying fabric that's 44 inches (that's about 112 cm, for those playing at home in metric). But that's *if* you’re clever with your layout and minimal waste. I once tried to be economical and ended up with sleeves that were 3 cm too short! Let's just say, my tailor gave me *the look*.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about the fabric needed for a simple kurta, and honestly, my brain did a little bhangra. It is like asking how long is a piece of string, bhai! Depends on so many things! Roughly, for an average adult (say, someone who is five feet six inches or around one hundred and sixty eight centimeter tall) you are looking at maybe two point five meters if you are buying fabric that is forty four inches (that is about one hundred and twelve centimeter, for those playing at home in metric).

{"unnormalised": "Now, if you're going for something fancy, like a Patiala salwar with your kurta, add *at least* another 3 meters. Patiala salwars are basically wearable tents, glorious, swishy tents, but tents nonetheless. Also, if you’re a taller or larger person (no judgment here, more fabric is always fabulous!) bump that number up. Maybe add another 0.5 m for safety. And don't even *think* about matching prints perfectly unless you want to buy enough fabric to clad a small village – that's easily an extra 1.5 m wasted, just getting the flowers lined up nicely!", "normalised": "Now, if you are going for something fancy, like a Patiala salwar with your kurta, add at least another three meters.

{"unnormalised": "So, to summarise: basic kurta, budget-friendly option is 2.5m of 44\" fabric. Want Patiala pyjamas and perfect print matching? Might as well buy the entire *thaan* (fabric roll)! Good luck and may your measurements always be accurate, and your sleeves never too short. You can thank me later over a cup of chai – paid for with the money you saved by not messing up your fabric order!", "normalised": "So, to summarize: basic kurta, budget-friendly option is two point five meter of forty four inch fabric.
