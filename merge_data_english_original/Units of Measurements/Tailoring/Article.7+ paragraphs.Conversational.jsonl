{"unnormalised": "First things first, ditch the idea of absolute precision. This isn't rocket science, though sometimes it feels like it! The key is to understand the ballpark figures. For example, if the darzi writes down \"shoulder: 16 in\", don’t panic if you measured 15.75 inches at home. There’s always some wiggle room (literally!). Tailors work with tape measures, not lasers.", "normalised": "First things first, ditch the idea of absolute precision. This is not rocket science, though sometimes it feels like it!

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of inches, that's mostly what you'll hear – \"in\". But be prepared for some local lingo. Sometimes, older tailors might use \"angul\" (finger-width), especially for small adjustments. Don’t worry, it's usually close to 3/4 of an inch, but confirm it if you're unsure. And remember, everything is usually in fractions of an inch or rounded up to the nearest whole number.", "normalised": "Speaking of inches, that is mostly what you will hear – \"in\".

{"unnormalised": "Now, what measurements are we actually talking about? Well, for a basic salwar kameez, expect measurements like \"bust: 36\", \"waist: 30\", \"hips: 38\". Pay close attention to how the tailor is measuring. Bust is usually taken at the fullest point, with the tape held parallel to the ground. Waist is at the natural waistline, not where your jeans sit! Hips are at the fullest point of your hips. Don't suck in! Breathe normally.", "normalised": "Now, what measurements are we actually talking about?

{"unnormalised": "For blouses, things get a little more complicated. You’ll need \"shoulder width: 14 in\", \"armhole: 16\", and \"sleeve length: 10\". Blouse length is crucial – do you want it cropped or long? And then there’s the neckline. Deep or high, round or square? Communicate clearly! A picture is worth a thousand words here.", "normalised": "For blouses, things get a little more complicated.

{"unnormalised": "For men, a shirt requires measurements like \"chest: 40\", \"shoulder: 18\", \"sleeve length: 33\", and \"collar: 15.5\". Trouser measurements include \"waist: 32\", \"inseam: 30\", and \"outseam: 40\". Again, clarity is key.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, remember the \"lambaai\" or \"length.\" This applies to everything – kameez length, kurta length, pant length. Be very specific about where you want the garment to end. “Knee length” can mean different things to different people. It’s best to point to the exact spot on your leg.", "normalised": "And finally, remember the \"lambaai\" or \"length\". This applies to everything – kameez length, kurta length, pant length.
