{"unnormalised": "Participants learned that inconsistent use of units like inches (\"in\") and centimeters (\"cm\") can lead to significant discrepancies, resulting in ill-fitting garments and customer dissatisfaction. Demonstrations highlighted how a 1-inch difference in a blouse's shoulder width or a 2cm variation in the pant length can affect the overall fit. The workshop stressed that standardized practices would contribute to a more streamlined and professional tailoring sector in the region.", "normalised": "Participants learned that inconsistent use of units like inches (in) and centimeters (c m) can lead to significant discrepancies, resulting in ill-fitting garments and customer dissatisfaction.

Tailors were encouraged to adopt measurement tapes and tools calibrated to the nearest 0.1 cm to ensure accuracy. Resources were also provided to access online conversion tools and measurement charts.", "normalised": "Furthermore, instructors emphasized the need for precise conversions between different measurement systems, particularly when dealing with patterns from international sources which often use measurements in feet (f t) or yards (y d).
