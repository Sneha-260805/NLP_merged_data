{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about measurements in tailoring, right? Well, in India, we mostly use centimetres (cm) and inches (in) when we're talking tailoring. Your tailor will probably have a measuring tape marked in both. For a saree blouse, you're looking at measurements like chest size, usually in inches, say 34in or 36in. Then there’s waist size and sleeve length also in inches. Height of the blouse is crucial too, often given in cm, something like 35cm from shoulder to waist.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about measurements in tailoring, right?

{"unnormalised": "For a salwar kameez, things get a little more detailed. You'll need measurements for shoulder width (maybe 14in), armhole (around 8in), and the length of the kameez, again in cm, like 110cm or 44in depending on the style. The salwar needs measurements for the waist (let's say 32in), hip (maybe 40in) and length, which can be anything from 38in to 40in. Don't forget the bottom width; that's important for getting the right fit!", "normalised": "For a salwar kameez, things get a little more detailed.

{"unnormalised": "And for men's kurtas, you’re again looking at inches for chest (40in), shoulder (17in), and sleeve length (25in). The kurta length will be in cm. Trouser measurements follow a similar pattern as salwars – waist in inches, length in inches, and bottom width. Basically, keep an eye on both units - ask your tailor if you are not sure. It really depends on their preference, but cm and inches are the go-to units for tailoring in India.", "normalised": "And for men's kurtas, you're again looking at inches for chest, forty inches, shoulder, seventeen inches, and sleeve length, twenty five inches.
