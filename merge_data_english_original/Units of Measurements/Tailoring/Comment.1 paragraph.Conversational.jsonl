{"unnormalised": "Arre yaar, the tailor just called. He needs 2.5 meters of fabric for the salwar kameez, and another 1.75 meters for the dupatta. Also, he mentioned the lace I wanted is only available in 2-inch width, so I need to get about 10 meters of it! Hope I can find everything in Chandni Chowk. Otherwise, this saree might need 6.25 meters for blouse, fall and petticoat. And don't forget, he also said to bring 500 grams of lining material. Shopping is going to take forever!", "normalised": "Arre yaar, the tailor just called.
