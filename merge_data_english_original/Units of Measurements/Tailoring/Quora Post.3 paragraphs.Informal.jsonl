{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the right measurements for a kurta? It's not as straightforward as you might think, bhai! You'll need a few things. First, get a good measuring tape, the kind tailors use, marked in both inches and cm (centimeters). Don't try using a regular ruler; you'll end up with a disaster, LOL. You’ll need to measure the chest (around the fullest part), the shoulder width (from one shoulder point to the other – usually around 18 inches for a medium size), and the kurta length (from the shoulder down to where you want it to end – maybe 42 inches?).", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the right measurements for a kurta?

{"unnormalised": "Next up: sleeves! Measure from your shoulder point down to your wrist bone. Most guys go for around 24 inches for a full sleeve, but it depends on your arm length, obviously. Also, consider the \"gera\" (the width at the bottom). This depends on the style, but usually around 44 inches is a safe bet for a comfortable fit. Pro Tip: Always add about 1/2 inch to 1 inch extra to all your measurements for seam allowance. Trust me, you'll thank me later. And don't forget the neck size - usually around 15 inches to 16 inches.", "normalised": "Next up: sleeves! Measure from your shoulder point down to your wrist bone.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember these are just guidelines! The best thing to do is to measure a kurta that already fits you well. Lay it flat on a table and take all the measurements from that. That way, you're guaranteed a good fit. Aur haan, if you're getting it stitched by a tailor, make sure to clearly specify whether you're giving measurements in inches or cm. A little confusion there can result in a major goof-up! Good luck, and happy stitching!", "normalised": "Finally, remember these are just guidelines!
