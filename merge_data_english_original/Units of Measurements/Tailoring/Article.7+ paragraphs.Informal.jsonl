{"unnormalised": "First things first, you'll need a trusty measuring tape. The kind with both centimeters (cm) and inches (in) is ideal, especially if you're working with patterns from different parts of the world. Make sure your measuring tape isn't stretched out or damaged, or you’ll end up with measurements that are way off. Think of it like this: a tape showing 102 cm when it should be 100 cm will cause huge fitting issues!", "normalised": "First things first, you'll need a trusty measuring tape.

{"unnormalised": "Now, for the basics. Grab a friend to help you – it's nearly impossible to get accurate back measurements on your own! Start with the bust. Measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Write that number down! Next up is the waist. Find your natural waistline (usually the narrowest point of your torso) and measure around it. Don’t suck in! You want a realistic measurement. Hips are next. Measure around the fullest part of your hips, again keeping the tape parallel to the floor. For a saree blouse, you’ll also need the shoulder width, measured from the edge of one shoulder to the edge of the other, across your back. It is typically around 14-16 inches. Also include the armhole depth, normally around 6-7 inches.", "normalised": "Now, for the basics. Grab a friend to help you – it's nearly impossible to get accurate back measurements on your own!

{"unnormalised": "Don't forget the details! For sleeve length, measure from the shoulder point down to where you want the sleeve to end. For pants, you'll need the inseam (from crotch to ankle) and the outseam (from waist to ankle). If you’re making a kurta, you’ll want the kurta length, measured from the shoulder down to the desired hemline, usually around 40-45 inches.", "normalised": "Don't forget the details!

{"unnormalised": "Pro Tip: When taking measurements, always add a little extra for ease. What's ease, you ask? It's the extra wiggle room that allows you to, you know, actually *move* in your clothes! For a fitted garment, add about 1-2 cm (0.5-1 in) to your bust, waist, and hip measurements. For something more relaxed, add even more! Imagine trying to sit in a saree blouse made with *zero* ease – not fun!", "normalised": "Pro Tip: When taking measurements, always add a little extra for ease. What's ease, you ask?

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial thing to remember is units! Make sure you're consistent with your units of measurement. Don’t mix cm for your bust and inches for your waist!

{"unnormalised": "Finally, and this is so important, write everything down clearly! I like to create a little chart with labels for each measurement. Bust: ___, Waist: ___, Hips: ___, and so on. This way, you won't get confused later on. Taking accurate measurements might seem like a pain, but it's the key to creating clothes that fit you perfectly. So, take your time, be precise, and happy sewing! Remember that even 0.5 cm can make a world of difference to your overall fit!", "normalised": "Finally, and this is so important, write everything down clearly!
