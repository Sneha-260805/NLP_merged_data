{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I just started learning tailoring from my mom, and it's way harder than it looks! I was trying to make a simple kurta, and measuring the fabric alone was a nightmare. The pattern called for 2.5 m of cloth, but the fabric store only had it in yards. I kept getting confused converting between the two. Plus, my mom kept saying \"1 hath\" which apparently is a traditional unit of measurement in our family, but I have NO IDEA how long MY hath is compared to hers.", "normalised": "Okay, so I just started learning tailoring from my mom, and it's way harder than it looks!

I marked everything according to the pattern - the sleeves needed to be 25 cm long, the neckline was supposed to be 15 cm wide, and the chest was like, 90 cm around. I swear my measuring tape has shrunk, because nothing seemed to line up! And don’t even get me started on the seam allowance – she wanted a “1 inch” seam, but I'm used to metric. I think I accidentally cut one sleeve about 2 cm shorter than the other.", "normalised": "Then came the actual cutting.

I think I'll just stick to ready-made clothes from Westside for now, where everything's already measured and I don't have to worry about converting between cm, inches and moms \"hath\"!
