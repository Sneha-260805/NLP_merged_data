{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I'm trying to make a *slightly* fancy kurta for Diwali this year. I bought this amazing silk fabric, right? The shopkeeper swore it was 4.5 m long, enough for a proper long kurta. Got home, laid it out, and it looks suspiciously short. Measured it myself and it's barely 4.25 m! I feel like I've been robbed of 25 cm of silk! What's a guy supposed to do with a kurta that's only knee-length? Looks like I’ll have to wear pajama with it :(.", "normalised": "Okay, so I'm trying to make a slightly fancy kurta for Diwali this year. I bought this amazing silk fabric, right?

{"unnormalised": "Now I'm wondering if I should just buy another 50 cm or so of fabric. Will the colours match? The tailor (bless his cotton socks) says it might look patchy. Seriously considering using some leftover material from my mom's old saree - she won’t mind, right? It’s like 1.5 m of random, shiny fabric. The kurta is already costing me a small fortune, about Rs. 3500 in stitching alone (that tailor charges by the mm, I swear).", "normalised": "Now I'm wondering if I should just buy another fifty centimeter or so of fabric.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, next time I'm buying fabric by the kg! Or maybe just sticking to readymade stuff. At least then I know the length is what it's supposed to be, and I won't have to deal with losing my mind over a few cm. Anyone else had this tailoring nightmare? Advice greatly appreciated, unless it involves wearing that saree fabric.", "normalised": "Honestly, next time I'm buying fabric by the kilogram! Or maybe just sticking to readymade stuff.
