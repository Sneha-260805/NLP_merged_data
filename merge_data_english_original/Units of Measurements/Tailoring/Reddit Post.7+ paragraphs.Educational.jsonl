{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's talk about lengths. For a standard men's shirt, the sleeve length is crucial. You'd typically measure it in inches (e.g., 33in or 34in). Also remember, the length of the finished shirt will vary depending on whether it's a casual, semi-formal, or formal piece, but on average it might be around 30-32 in. In India, we use inches most often, but occasionally someone might mention cm (centimeters) – just remember 1 inch is roughly 2.54 cm.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's talk about lengths.

{"unnormalised": "Next up is the chest measurement. This is arguably the most important measurement for shirts and jackets. You'll want to measure around the fullest part of the chest, usually under the armpits. This is also given in inches (e.g., 40in, 42in). For ladies blouses the bust measurement is similar, using inches as the primary unit of measure.", "normalised": "Next up is the chest measurement.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the waist. For trousers or salwars, the waist measurement is usually taken at the natural waistline. For men, this is often just below the navel, while for women, it might be at the narrowest part of the torso. Again, this is typically in inches (e.g., 32in, 34in). You'll also want to note the inseam – the length from the crotch to the bottom of the leg – also in inches (e.g., 30in, 32in).", "normalised": "Then there's the waist.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to fabrics, we often deal with meters (m) or yards (yds). A saree, for example, is typically around 5.5m - 6m in length. A standard salwar kameez set might require around 2.5m of fabric. And for lining, you might need anywhere from 1m to 2m, depending on the garment. Be sure to always confirm the width of the fabric, though!", "normalised": "Moving on to fabrics, we often deal with meters (meters) or yards (yards).

{"unnormalised": "For smaller measurements, like button sizes or seam allowances, we often use millimeters (mm). A standard button might be 10mm or 12mm in diameter. Seam allowances might be 10mm - 15mm, or even smaller depending on the project.", "normalised": "For smaller measurements, like button sizes or seam allowances, we often use millimeters (millimeters).

{"unnormalised": "Finally, something that's frequently overlooked is the weight of the fabric. It's usually measured in grams per square meter (gsm). A lightweight cotton might be around 120gsm, while a heavier denim could be 400gsm or more. Understanding fabric weight can help you determine the drape and feel of the garment.", "normalised": "Finally, something that's frequently overlooked is the weight of the fabric.

Understanding fabric weight can help you determine the drape and feel of the garment."}
