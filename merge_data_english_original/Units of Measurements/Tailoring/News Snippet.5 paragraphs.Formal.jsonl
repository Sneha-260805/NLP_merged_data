{"unnormalised": "The primary objective is to address the inconsistencies arising from the prevalent use of varied, often localized, measurement units. Currently, tailors across the country employ a mix of inches, centimeters (cm), and the traditional 'haath' (approximately 1.5 feet), leading to confusion and increased error rates. The new directive advocates for exclusive use of cm and meters (m) in all transactions and documentation related to tailoring.", "normalised": "The primary objective is to address the inconsistencies arising from the prevalent use of varied, often localized, measurement units.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the Ministry is partnering with vocational training institutes to incorporate standardized measurement techniques into tailoring curricula. Workshops are being conducted to educate tailors on accurate measuring practices and the benefits of adopting a uniform system. These programs also cover the calibration and maintenance of measuring instruments, ensuring precise measurements across the board. One key focus is on digital measuring tools and software, which utilize mm precision for pattern design.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the Ministry is partnering with vocational training institutes to incorporate standardized measurement techniques into tailoring curricula.

{"unnormalised": "The implementation of these standards is expected to bring about several positive outcomes. Firstly, it will streamline the fabric purchasing process for both consumers and businesses. Secondly, improved measurement accuracy will minimize material wastage, contributing to sustainability efforts within the textile industry. Initial reports suggest a potential reduction in fabric wastage by as much as 10% post-implementation.", "normalised": "The implementation of these standards is expected to bring about several positive outcomes.
