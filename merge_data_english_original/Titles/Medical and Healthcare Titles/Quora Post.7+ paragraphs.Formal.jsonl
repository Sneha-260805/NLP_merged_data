We now see a rise in specialized practitioners, such as \"Physiotherapist Patel,\" \"Dietician Iyer,\" and \"Nurse Aisha,\" who, while essential to patient care, may not hold a \"Doctor\" of Medicine degree. Furthermore, the growing emphasis on interprofessional collaboration requires healthcare teams to interact on a more equitable footing. In such settings, sticking rigidly to only \"Doctor\" for physicians might inadvertently create a hierarchical divide that hinders communication and teamwork."}

In some hospitals, particularly those with a more modern management style, using first names or professional designations is becoming increasingly acceptable.
