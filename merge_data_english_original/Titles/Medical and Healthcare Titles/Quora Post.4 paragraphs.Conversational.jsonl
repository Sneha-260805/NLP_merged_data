{"unnormalised": "So, I was wondering about something the other day, and thought I'd ask here. What exactly do all the titles in the medical field *really* mean? I mean, you've got everything from \"Dr.\" to \"Prof.\" to \"MD\" to \"BDS,\" and honestly, it's a bit confusing. I'm sure there's a logical explanation, but it's not always clear from just looking at a doctor's nameplate! Especially here in India, where we have ayurvedic doctors (like \"Vaidya\" or \"Dr. (Ayurveda)\") along with allopathic ones.", "normalised": "So, I was wondering about something the other day, and thought I would ask here.

{"unnormalised": "For example, what's the difference between a \"Dr.\" and a \"Prof.\"? Is a \"Prof.\" always a more experienced \"Dr.\"? And what about degrees like \"MBBS\" or \"MS\"? Are they just basic qualifications, or do they signify something more specialized? Then you have these honorifics like \"Padma Shri Dr.\" before a name - what does that even mean in the context of their medical practice? A little clarity would be super helpful.
