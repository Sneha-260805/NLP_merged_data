{"unnormalised": "What I find particularly interesting is how these titles often carry different weights depending on the context. In a big, fancy hospital like Max Healthcare, \"Dr.\" Gupta might be a seasoned consultant, while in a smaller nursing home, a \"Dr.\" Banerjee could be a recent graduate.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are the honorifics. I remember my grandmother always referring to her family physician as \"Vaidya Ji\" even though he had a modern MBBS degree. It was a sign of respect and familiarity, a custom that blended traditional and modern medicine.

{"unnormalised": "We also can't forget the titles of those who are not directly \"doctors,\" but play a critical role. Think about \"Sr. Nurse\" Mary at your local hospital, or \"Pharmacist\" Patel who always knows the right medication for your cough. They are just as important in the healthcare ecosystem and deserve the same amount of respect. I also wonder if titles such as \"Yoga Instructor\" and \"Nutritionist\" need more recognition as preventive healthcare becomes more popular.", "normalised": "We also can't forget the titles of those who are not directly \"doctors,\" but play a critical role.

They all come together to provide the best possible care, and recognizing their contributions is a small but meaningful way to show our gratitude. What are your thoughts on this?
