{"unnormalised": "My wife, Priya Sharma, recently completed her MBBS and MD, specialising in cardiology. It was a gruelling process, years of intense study and practical training.

{"unnormalised": "The issue is, my parents and siblings are having a hard time adjusting to calling her \"Dr. Sharma\". They insist that at home, we're all family, and formal titles feel unnatural and distant. They prefer to call her by her first name, Priya. I understand their point to some extent, but I feel it's a matter of respect. She has earned this title, and it's a recognition of her hard work and achievements. It is a professional title and should be respected.", "normalised": "The issue is, my parents and siblings are having a hard time adjusting to calling her \"Doctor Sharma\".

{"unnormalised": "I've tried explaining to them that using her title, even informally, acknowledges her professional identity. It's not about creating distance but showing appreciation for what she has accomplished. Even outside the home, when speaking about her in a professional context to acquaintances, referring to her as Dr. Sharma is vital. My mother says, \"Beta, she's our bahu (daughter-in-law) first,\" which I get, but it doesn't negate her professional standing.", "normalised": "I have tried explaining to them that using her title, even informally, acknowledges her professional identity.

{"unnormalised": "My wife, while understanding, seems a bit uncomfortable with the whole situation. She doesn't want to cause friction within the family. Still, she secretly admitted to feeling a little deflated when her achievements are overlooked in favour of familiar intimacy. She’s mentioned, in passing, that even her senior colleagues at AIIMS sometimes struggle to consistently use titles, especially with female doctors. I believe this stems from deeply rooted societal norms which should be proactively resisted.", "normalised": "My wife, while understanding, seems a bit uncomfortable with the whole situation.

{"unnormalised": "So, am I the a**hole for insisting on this, even though it's causing some tension? Is it really that important to maintain formality within the family, or am I being overly sensitive and imposing my views? I am really torn about how to handle this, considering my sister just started studying under Dr. Verma at Lady Hardinge Medical College. I would prefer my family to show the same respect to my wife.", "normalised": "So, am I the a-hole for insisting on this, even though it is causing some tension?
