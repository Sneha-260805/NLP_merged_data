Anyone with an MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) degree in India, or an equivalent MD (Doctor of Medicine) or DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) degree from other countries can use “Dr.” before their name. Dr. Sharma might be your general physician at Apollo Clinic, or Dr. Khan could be the pediatrician down the street.

{"unnormalised": "Now, things get a little more interesting. After the MBBS, a lot of doctors go on to specialize.

So, Dr. Gupta might have an MD in Internal Medicine, making him a specialist in diagnosing and treating diseases of the internal organs. Or, Dr. Patel could have an MS in General Surgery, meaning they’re a qualified surgeon. Dr. Iyer might hold a DNB in Cardiology.", "normalised": "Now, things get a little more interesting.
