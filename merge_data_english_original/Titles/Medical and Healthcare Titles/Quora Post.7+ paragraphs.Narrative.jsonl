It’s surreal to think about the journey she took, from prepping for NEET at Allen coaching classes in Kota to finally holding that degree. The respect she commands now is palpable. People address her with utmost deference, always “Dr. Sharma,” even outside the hospital. It's a world away from Sharmaji, isn't it? The weight of those initials, “MD,” is heavy with expectations, responsibilities, and, of course, prestige.", "normalised": "Then there’s my cousin, Priya.

{"unnormalised": "But it got me wondering about all the other titles and roles within the medical hierarchy. You've got the RN, registered nurses, who are often the unsung heroes of patient care. They're the ones spending the most time at the bedside, administering meds and monitoring vitals, and yet they often don't get the same recognition as the physicians. My aunt, for instance, worked as a nurse for over 30 years in a govt. hospital in Kerala. She always felt that “Nurse” was enough, not needing further qualification. Still, it felt a bit…diminishing.", "normalised": "But it got me wondering about all the other titles and roles within the medical hierarchy.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the MBBS, the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. It’s like the entry point for becoming a doctor in India, right?

You also have the paramedical staff – technicians, therapists, assistants.

{"unnormalised": "And what about the honorifics? I've heard older patients address doctors as \"Vaidya ji\" still, a nod to the traditional Ayurvedic practitioners. I’ve even heard “Hakim Saab” in some parts of Old Delhi. Does that mean the formal “Dr.” title is losing its cultural significance? Or are these just remnants of a different time? Maybe it's just a cultural thing that's specific to certain areas.
