{"unnormalised": "MBBS stands for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. It's the basic medical degree in India, the equivalent of a medical degree you'd get in many countries. After completing 5.5 years (including a 1-year internship) of rigorous medical training in a medical college like AIIMS or CMC Vellore, you're awarded the MBBS degree.

{"unnormalised": "MD, which is Doctor of Medicine, is a postgraduate degree. After completing your MBBS, you can pursue an MD in a specific field like General Medicine, Pediatrics, or Radiology. This usually takes 3 years. So, \"Dr. Rajesh Kumar, MD (Medicine)\" means Dr. Kumar has a postgraduate specialization in internal medicine. There's also DM, which is Doctor of Medicine, but is a super-specialization done *after* MD (e.g., DM Cardiology). Confusing, right? Think of it like this: MBBS->MD (Specialization)->DM (Super Specialization).
