{"unnormalised": "Okay, let's break down the common medical titles you'll often encounter in India. It can be a bit confusing, especially given the mix of qualifications and professional roles. The basic degree is MBBS, which stands for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Think of this as your entry ticket into the world of medicine. After completing the MBBS, doctors can start practicing as general physicians or pursue further specialization.", "normalised": "Okay, let us break down the common medical titles you will often encounter in India.

{"unnormalised": "Now, what about \"Dr.\"? \"Dr.\" or Doctor is a general title conferred upon anyone who has successfully completed their MBBS degree. So, even a fresh graduate is addressed as Dr. Sharma, or Dr. Khan. Using Dr. is considered a sign of respect and professional acknowledgement in Indian society. Many MBBS graduates immediately append “Dr.” before their name. This doesn't automatically imply any specialisation. It simply means they are qualified to practice medicine.", "normalised": "Now, what about \"Doctor\"? \"Doctor\" or Doctor is a general title conferred upon anyone who has successfully completed their M-B-B-S degree.

{"unnormalised": "The title \"Prof.\", short for Professor, is a bit different. It indicates an individual who is teaching at a medical college or university. A Prof. is not just a doctor; they are also involved in academic work, research, and mentoring students. To become a professor, a doctor typically needs to have completed their postgraduate degree (MD or MS), gain substantial experience in their field, and then be appointed to a teaching position at a medical institution. Prof. Gupta at AIIMS, for example, would likely be teaching surgery to MBBS and postgraduate students, while also conducting research.", "normalised": "The title \"Professor\", short for Professor, is a bit different.

{"unnormalised": "So, to summarize: all Professors who are medical professionals are also Doctors (they hold an MBBS degree). All Doctors are not necessarily Professors. And MBBS is the fundamental qualification to be either a Dr. or ultimately, a Prof. Hopefully, this clarifies the roles and qualifications associated with these titles in the Indian medical field. Good luck understanding the difference!", "normalised": "So, to summarize: all Professors who are medical professionals are also Doctors (they hold an M-B-B-S degree).
