You've got your standard \"Dr.\" for physicians, of course, but the scene is much richer than that.

You might encounter \"Prof.\" Sharma, a renowned cardiologist leading groundbreaking research, or \"Mrs.\" Iyer, the Head Nurse who practically runs the ICU ward with her calm efficiency.

{"unnormalised": "Even within the same hospital, you'll see a hierarchy reflected in titles. A \"Jr. Resident\" is on a totally different rung than a \"Sr. Consultant.\" \"Ward Boys\" and \"Aayas\" perform essential support roles, and their contributions are just as critical to patient care.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of corporate hospitals has also added another layer. You'll see titles like \"Regional Head - Medical Operations\" or \"VP - Patient Experience,\" reflecting a focus on management and customer service, alongside the traditional medical roles.

A \"Dr.\" with a fancy degree isn't necessarily a better doctor than a \"Vaidya\" with years of experience in a rural clinic. The real measure of a healthcare professional is their compassion, their dedication, and their commitment to their patients.
