{"unnormalised": "First off, \"Dr.\" is pretty straightforward. It's short for \"Doctor,\" and usually means someone's slaved away for years in med school, survived grueling internships (think Grey's Anatomy, but with more chai breaks), and can actually prescribe you something stronger than ginger ale for your cold. We're talking MBBS, MD, DM... the whole shebang. Basically, they've earned the right to scribble indecipherable prescriptions and charge you Rs. 500 for a 5-minute consultation.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a Medical Officer (MO) is where things get a bit... muddled, like trying to navigate Delhi traffic at 5 PM. The term \"Medical Officer\" is an umbrella, like the one you use during Mumbai monsoon season – it covers a lot! An MO can be a Dr. (as in, someone with that MBBS degree), but not always. They often work for the government, in public health, or in organizations where they're responsible for overseeing medical services. Think of them as the administrative types, the guys who make sure there's enough antiseptic lotion and that the ambulances actually have petrol.

{"unnormalised": "The main difference? A Dr. usually deals directly with patients, diagnosing and treating illnesses. They're the ones saying \"Open wide\" and poking you with cold stethoscopes. A Medical Officer may or may not be doing that. They might be managing a hospital wing, implementing health programs, or writing reports about disease outbreaks. They can also work in corporate setups and oversee employee health.", "normalised": "The main difference? A Doctor usually deals directly with patients, diagnosing and treating illnesses.
