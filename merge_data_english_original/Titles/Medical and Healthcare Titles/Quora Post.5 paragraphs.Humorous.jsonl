{"unnormalised": "Well, this could spark a family feud faster than discussing politics at Diwali! But let’s try to clarify things with a touch of humour. Basically, a Vaidya (often abbreviated as Vd.) practices Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine. Think of it as the OG of holistic healing. They use herbs, lifestyle recommendations, and sometimes even a good dose of common sense. My grandma swears by her Vd. Sharma – says he's the only one who can cure her bad knees!", "normalised": "Well, this could spark a family feud faster than discussing politics at Diwali!

{"unnormalised": "Now, a Doctor (often seen as Dr.), usually practices modern medicine, which is all about science, evidence-based treatments, and sometimes, really long medical school terms that sound like they were invented by aliens. They might prescribe antibiotics, perform surgeries, and understand the mysteries of the human body using tools and techniques your grandma probably hasn't even dreamed of.

Think of it like this: A Vaidya is your friendly neighbourhood chaiwala, brewing up traditional remedies, while a Doctor is like a fancy coffee shop, serving up lattes of modern science.
