{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me if Dr. and Prof. are the same thing. Well, not exactly, bhai. Let me try to explain it simply for you. In India, especially when we're talking about medical professionals, there's a bit of a hierarchy and different roles. \"Dr.\" is pretty straightforward – it’s short for Doctor and means someone has earned a doctoral degree, like an MBBS or MD. You'll call pretty much any medical practitioner \"Dr.\" whether they're working in a big hospital like AIIMS or running a small clinic in your mohalla.", "normalised": "Someone asked me if Doctor and Professor are the same thing.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: all Professors are Doctors, but not all Doctors are Professors. You might see Dr. Kumar, a renowned cardiologist, who operates regularly but doesn't teach. He's a fantastic doctor but not a Prof. On the other hand, Dr. Sen, the head of department at CMC Vellore, also teaches and conducts research, so he's rightly called Prof. Sen.

{"unnormalised": "It can get a bit confusing with different specialisations though. You might hear \"Dr.\" used more loosely, even for someone with, say, a PhD in Biochemistry doing research in a hospital lab. That person isn't treating patients directly, but they're still contributing to healthcare.
