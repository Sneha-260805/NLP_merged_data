My prof in the Comp Sci dept, Dr. Verma, keeps calling me by my deadname on the attendance sheet. I corrected him the first day, politely, but he kinda brushed it off, saying “It's just for official records, Beta. Don't worry.” It's been a month, and he still does it. I’ve even emailed him with a copy of my updated Aadhaar card to show the legal name change.", "normalised": "So, I am a trans guy, and I started my first year at I-I-T Delhi this fall.
