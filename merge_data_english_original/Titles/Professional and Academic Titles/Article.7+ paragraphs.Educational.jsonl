{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's consider academic titles. In India, much like elsewhere, individuals who have earned a doctorate degree are correctly addressed as \"Dr.\" For instance, Dr. Meena Patel is appropriate for someone holding a PhD in any field. It's important to note that this is regardless of whether they are actively practicing medicine. A PhD in history or engineering also warrants the \"Dr.\" title. When corresponding in writing, it is always best to use the full title, Dr., rather than assuming informality. This applies to both formal correspondence and initial communications. Subsequent communication may become more informal, depending on the relationship.", "normalised": "Firstly, let us consider academic titles.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, in academic institutions, the titles \"Professor\", \"Associate Professor\", and \"Assistant Professor\" indicate specific ranks within the faculty hierarchy. These titles are usually held for a specific duration, subject to renewals or further promotions. A Professor, often referred to as Prof., holds the highest rank, signifying significant contributions to their field through research, teaching, and service. It’s a recognition of their expertise and impact. Similarly, Associate Prof. and Assistant Prof. represent different stages within the academic career ladder. When addressing faculty, use their highest earned title. For example, Prof. R.K. Sharma or Dr. S. Banerjee if they also hold a doctorate.", "normalised": "Furthermore, in academic institutions, the titles \"Professor\", \"Associate Professor\", and \"Assistant Professor\" indicate specific ranks within the faculty hierarchy.

{"unnormalised": "In the medical field, the lines can sometimes blur. While all medical doctors (MBBS degree holders and above) are addressed as Dr., it's crucial to distinguish between specialists.

Similarly, a consultant at a hospital like AIIMS might be introduced as Dr. A. Sengupta, Consultant, Cardiology Dept.", "normalised": "In the medical field, the lines can sometimes blur.
