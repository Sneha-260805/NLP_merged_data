I work at a small I-T firm in Bangalore, nothing fancy, just your average nine-to-five kinda gig, except it rarely is actually nine-to-five, is it? Anyway, my designation is Senior Software Engineer, which sounds way more impressive than it is, trust me."}

He walks in, all swagger and polished shoes, and starts rattling off his demands. Standard stuff, right? Except, he kept addressing our project lead, Ms. Desai, as \"Madam Project Manager.\" Now, Ms. Desai is brilliant, absolutely top-notch, but she's not a project manager. She's the Lead Architect, completely different role."}

He kept referring to our junior developer, Rohit Sharma, as \"Doctor Sharma.\" Rohit, bless his heart, just finished his Bachelor's degree last year and is probably the furthest thing from a doctor you can imagine.

It's like, titles are just labels to some people, not actual representations of skill and experience."}

How often do we just assume someone's role or expertise based on their name, gender, or ethnicity? This client, this \"Mr. Henderson\" (as I think his name was), he just saw what he expected to see, not what was actually there. It was seriously infuriating and also a little depressing. Anyone else have similar experiences with messed-up titles or assumptions at work? Please share! It would make me feel like I’m not alone in this…"}
