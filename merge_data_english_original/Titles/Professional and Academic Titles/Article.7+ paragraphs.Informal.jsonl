{"unnormalised": "First off, let’s be real – a title like \"Dr.\" or \"Prof.\" does carry weight, especially in India. Whether you're Dr. Sharma at AIIMS or Prof. Banerjee at Jadavpur University, that title instantly gives you credibility. People automatically assume you know your stuff (which, hopefully, you do!). It’s that instant respect factor, you know?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about academic titles. Imagine Dr. Khan, a renowned physicist from TIFR, giving a lecture. Would you listen more attentively if he was just introduced as \"Mr. Khan\"? Probably not. That \"Dr.\" tells you he's spent years researching, publishing papers, and contributing to the field. It's a signal of expertise that can't be ignored.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there's a flip side. Some people get way too hung up on titles, using them as a way to feel superior or to intimidate others.
