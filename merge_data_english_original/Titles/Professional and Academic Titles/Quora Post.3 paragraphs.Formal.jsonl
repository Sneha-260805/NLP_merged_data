{"unnormalised": "Addressing individuals holding multiple titles requires a nuanced approach, especially in formal settings. Generally, it's advisable to use the highest-ranking or most relevant title based on the context of the interaction. For instance, if interacting with someone who is both a \"Dr.\" and a \"Prof.\", you might use \"Prof.\" in an academic environment, highlighting their professorial role. However, in a medical consultation, \"Dr.\" would be the more appropriate form of address. When unsure, defaulting to the highest academic title, such as \"Prof.\" or \"Dr.\", is often a safe and respectful option.", "normalised": "Addressing individuals holding multiple titles requires a nuanced approach, especially in formal settings.

You could politely inquire, \"How would you prefer to be addressed?\" or \"Which title should I use when referring to you?\".
