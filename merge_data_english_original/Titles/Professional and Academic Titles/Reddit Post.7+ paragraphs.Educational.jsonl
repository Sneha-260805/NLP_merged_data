This usually means someone has a doctorate (P-h-D) in a particular field. But remember, in India, sometimes you'll see Doctor used for medical doctors (M-B-B-S, M-D, etcetera) too. So context is key, bhai! For example, Doctor Sharma might be a cardiologist at A-I-I-M-S, or Doctor Patel could be a professor of history at J-N-U. Totally different fields, same title."}

You often see \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" used most of the time, but there are still titles to consider. C-E-O (Chief Executive Officer) is usually the top dog, running the whole company.
