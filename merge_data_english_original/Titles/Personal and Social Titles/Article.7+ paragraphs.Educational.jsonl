{"unnormalised": "One of the most common and versatile titles is \"ji.\" This suffix can be added to a person's name as a sign of respect. For example, addressing a younger person named Priya as \"Priya ji\" adds a touch of formality and politeness. Similarly, addressing someone older, say Mr. Sharma, as \"Sharma ji\" is standard practice. It's a simple yet effective way to convey deference and regard. \"Ji\" can also be used independently, as in \"Haan ji\" (Yes, sir/madam) or \"Nahin ji\" (No, sir/madam), particularly when interacting with elders or those in positions of authority.", "normalised": "one of the most common and versatile titles is \"ji.\" this suffix can be added to a person's name as a sign of respect. for example, addressing a younger person named priya as \"priya ji\" adds a touch of formality and politeness. similarly, addressing someone older, say mister sharma, as \"sharma ji\" is standard practice. it's a simple yet effective way to convey deference and regard. \"ji\" can also be used independently, as in \"haan ji\" (yes, sir/madam) or \"nahin ji\" (no, sir/madam), particularly when interacting with elders or those in positions of authority."}
{"unnormalised": "When referring to elders in general, terms like \"Uncle\" and \"Aunty\" are widely used, even if there's no familial connection. Addressing an older man as \"Uncle\" and an older woman as \"Aunty,\" followed by their name if known (e.g., \"Uncle Rajesh,\" \"Aunty Sunita\") is a respectful way to acknowledge their age and experience. However, it's always wise to gauge the individual's preference. Some people may prefer to be addressed by their name alone, or with \"ji\" appended. For instance, Mrs. Verma may prefer to be called Verma ji rather than Aunty Verma.", "normalised": "when referring to elders in general, terms like \"uncle\" and \"aunty\" are widely used, even if there's no familial connection. addressing an older man as \"uncle\" and an older woman as \"aunty,\" followed by their name if known (e.g., \"uncle rajesh,\" \"aunty sunita\") is a respectful way to acknowledge their age and experience. however, it's always wise to gauge the individual's preference. some people may prefer to be addressed by their name alone, or with \"ji\" appended. for instance, missus verma may prefer to be called verma ji rather than aunty verma."}
{"unnormalised": "Within families, specific titles are used to address different relatives. \"Mata ji\" and \"Pita ji\" are respectful terms for mother and father, respectively. A more informal, affectionate term for father is \"Papa ji.\" Other common familial titles include \"Dada ji\" (grandfather), \"Dadi ji\" (grandmother), \"Chacha ji\" (paternal uncle), \"Chachi ji\" (paternal aunt), \"Mama ji\" (maternal uncle), \"Mami ji\" (maternal aunt), \"Bhai\" or \"Bhaiya\" (elder brother), and \"Didi\" or \"Behen ji\" (elder sister). These titles not only denote the relationship but also convey affection and respect for the family hierarchy. For example, addressing one's elder brother as \"Rohan Bhaiya\" is far more common than simply calling him \"Rohan\".", "normalised": "within families, specific titles are used to address different relatives. \"mata ji\" and \"pita ji\" are respectful terms for mother and father, respectively. a more informal, affectionate term for father is \"papa ji.\" other common familial titles include \"dada ji\" (grandfather), \"dadi ji\" (grandmother), \"chacha ji\" (paternal uncle), \"chachi ji\" (paternal aunt), \"mama ji\" (maternal uncle), \"mami ji\" (maternal aunt), \"bhai\" or \"bhaiya\" (elder brother), and \"didi\" or \"behen ji\" (elder sister). these titles not only denote the relationship but also convey affection and respect for the family hierarchy. for example, addressing one's elder brother as \"rohan bhaiya\" is far more common than simply calling him \"rohan\"."}
{"unnormalised": "For women, the marital status also plays a role in the title used. \"Kumari\" (Km.) is sometimes used before the name of an unmarried woman, though it's becoming less common. \"Smt.\" (Shrimati) is the standard title for a married woman, preceding her name. The use of \"Ms.\" is also becoming more prevalent, especially among younger generations, as a neutral title irrespective of marital status. If unsure, using \"Ms.\" is often a safe and respectful option. For instance, Smt. Iyer would be used for a married woman, while Ms. Kapoor could be used regardless of her marital status.", "normalised": "for women, the marital status also plays a role in the title used. \"kumari\" (k-m) is sometimes used before the name of an unmarried woman, though it's becoming less common. \"s-m-t\" (shrimati) is the standard title for a married woman, preceding her name. the use of \"m-s\" is also becoming more prevalent, especially among younger generations, as a neutral title irrespective of marital status. if unsure, using \"m-s\" is often a safe and respectful option. for instance, s-m-t iyer would be used for a married woman, while m-s kapoor could be used regardless of her marital status."}
