Think of it as similar to \"Sir\" or \"Madam,\" but way more versatile. You can use it for pretty much anyone you respect or want to show a little politeness to. Like, you’d call your elder brother \"Bhai Ji\" or your teacher \"Madam Ji\". It's especially used when you don't know someone's name or want to be extra respectful. So, if you're asking a shopkeeper for the price of something, you'd say \"Kitne ka hai Ji?\"", "normalised": "Someone asked me why we use \"Ji\" after names in India.

It's a cultural thing, and you'll hear it everywhere, from bustling markets to fancy restaurants. It’s a little difficult to explain, but trust me you will pick it up by spending some time in India.
