{"unnormalised": "So, I'm a bit confused. Is it proper to call someone \"Mr.\" even if they're unmarried? My friend, Rakesh, insists I should address his older brother, who's still single, as \"Mr. Sharma\" out of respect. I always thought \"Mr.\" was only for married men, and \"Master\" was for young unmarried boys (though who even uses that anymore, lol). What's the etiquette in India regarding these things? Especially in North India?", "normalised": "So, I am a bit confused. Is it proper to call someone \"Mister\" even if they are unmarried?

{"unnormalised": "My cousin, Aisha, told me it's more of a generational thing. Older folks, like maybe her grandfather, who's addressed as \"Chaudhary Sahib\" in their village, still prefer formal titles. But younger generations are usually cool with just using their first name, or \"Bhai\" if it's a close male friend or relative.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about women? Is \"Ms.\" acceptable for any unmarried woman, or is it considered a bit too Westernized? My aunt, Dr. Patel, always uses \"Ms.\" on official documents, but informally everyone just calls her \"Auntyji.\" Confusing, right? I'd appreciate any insights or personal experiences!", "normalised": "Also, what about women? Is \"Mizz\" acceptable for any unmarried woman, or is it considered a bit too Westernized?
