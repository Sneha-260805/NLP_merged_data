After all, he’s survived countless transfers, dealt with ministers who thought PowerPoint was a new type of spice, and navigated office politics with the finesse of a seasoned diplomat. But missing files, especially ones involving goats and national development, well, that’s a different kettle of fish (or should we say, a different pen of goats?).", "normalised": "Now, J-S Sharma, as he’s fondly (or not so fondly) called, is not easily flustered.
