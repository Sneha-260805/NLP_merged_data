From the humble “Clerk” to the mighty “Principal Secretary,” they echo through the halls of power like Bollywood songs at a wedding – ubiquitous and sometimes deafening. You could practically build a career just collecting honorary titles; I hear \"Supreme Tea Maker\" is highly sought after.", "normalised": "The bureaucratic jungle of India is a sight to behold, a colorful tapestry woven with the threads of countless forms, rubber stamps, and, of course, titles.

They're not just labels; they're keys – sometimes to success, sometimes to endless waiting, and always to a good story. And who knows, maybe one day you’ll earn your own ridiculously long, impossibly important-sounding title. Just be sure to get it printed on a nice, laminated nameplate. After all, in India, a good title is worth its weight in gold... or maybe just a few well-placed chai breaks.", "normalised": "So, next time you find yourself navigating the labyrinthine corridors of Indian bureaucracy, remember the titles.
