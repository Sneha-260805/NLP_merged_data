{"unnormalised": "My chacha, or uncle, Rakesh Sharma always held a certain… gravitas. Not just because he was tall and imposing, but because he carried himself with the weight of responsibility. Growing up in a small village in Bihar, he was always a bright spark, acing his exams and dreaming of bigger things. He wasn’t just aiming for any job; he wanted to be someone who could actually make a difference. That's why he poured over his UPSC books, sacrificing sleep and chai sessions with friends, all to achieve his goal. After what felt like a lifetime of rigorous study, he finally cracked it. He became an IAS officer.", "normalised": "My chacha, or uncle, Rakesh Sharma always held a certain… gravitas.

{"unnormalised": "The day he got his posting as District Magistrate (DM) of Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh, was a day of celebration in our entire extended family. Dadi distributed sweets, and everyone spoke of the prestige and power the position held. Little did we truly understand the weight he carried on his shoulders. His job, as he described it, was akin to being the 'chief everything officer' of the district. From maintaining law and order to overseeing developmental projects, ensuring smooth elections to managing natural disasters, he was the go-to person for everything.", "normalised": "The day he got his posting as District Magistrate (D-M) of Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh, was a day of celebration in our entire extended family.

{"unnormalised": "I remember visiting him in Sitapur sometime in 2018. The DM's office was a bustling hub of activity. Peons scurried about, files piled high, and a constant stream of people waited to meet him. Seeing him in action was an eye-opener. He listened patiently to a distraught farmer complaining about crop damage due to unseasonal rains, assuring him of swift action and compensation. He then dealt with a delegation of school teachers protesting about delayed salaries. He explained the budgetary constraints but promised to look into the matter urgently. His phone rang incessantly – updates about a potential communal disturbance in a neighboring town, requests from politicians, and administrative queries from various departments. He handled each call with a calm composure that I found truly remarkable.", "normalised": "I remember visiting him in Sitapur sometime in two thousand eighteen.

{"unnormalised": "The demands on his time were relentless. One evening, while having dinner, he received a call about a fire in a local market. He immediately rushed to the scene, coordinating the fire brigade and ensuring the safety of the residents. He didn't return home until well after midnight. The next day, he was back in his office, attending meetings and reviewing project proposals. I asked him how he managed to cope with the constant pressure. He smiled wearily and said, \"It's a duty, beta. People depend on us. If we don't work, who will?\"", "normalised": "The demands on his time were relentless.

{"unnormalised": "One instance I recall vividly involved a dispute over land ownership between two influential families in the district. The case had been dragging on for years, fueling animosity and even leading to minor clashes. DM Sharma, or R.K. Sharma, as his full name was, personally intervened, poring over old land records and meeting with both parties. He patiently mediated, working towards a solution that was fair and acceptable to everyone. It took weeks of painstaking effort, but eventually, he managed to broker a settlement, preventing a potentially violent escalation.", "normalised": "One instance I recall vividly involved a dispute over land ownership between two influential families in the district.
