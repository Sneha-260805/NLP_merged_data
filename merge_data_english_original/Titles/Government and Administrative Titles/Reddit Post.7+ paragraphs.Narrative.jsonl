{"unnormalised": "So, a bit of background. My cousin, let's call him Rohan, and I, we're pretty close. Grew up together in the same mohalla in Lucknow. We both went to the same sarkari school and even tried for the IIT entrance exam together (both bombed, lol). Anyway, Rohan has always been… let’s say, enthusiastic about politics. Since school, he was always attending rallies, arguing about policies, the whole nine yards. I was more into coding and computers.", "normalised": "So, a bit of background.

He gets a driver, a govt. allotted Bolero, and the title of \"District Coordinator.\" Cool, but... that’s it? I mean, he’s not really implementing policy or anything. Its more of a supervisor role if you get me.

I mean, yeah, good for him for getting a govt. job, especially in UP, but it just felt…underwhelming?
