{"unnormalised": "Addressing individuals with military ranks in India requires adherence to specific protocols and etiquette. For officers, it's generally appropriate to use \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" followed by their rank. For instance, a Lieutenant General would be addressed as \"Sir, Lieutenant General\" or \"Madam, Lieutenant General.\" In formal written communication, including emails or official documents, always include the full rank and name, such as \"Lt. Gen. R.K. Sharma.\" While interacting with JCOs (Junior Commissioned Officers) like Naib Subedars or Havildars, addressing them respectfully as \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" is acceptable, particularly in a formal setting.", "normalised": "addressing individuals with military ranks in India requires adherence to specific protocols and etiquette. for officers, it is generally appropriate to use \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" followed by their rank. for instance, a Lieutenant General would be addressed as \"Sir, Lieutenant General\" or \"Madam, Lieutenant General.\" in formal written communication, including emails or official documents, always include the full rank and name, such as \"Lieutenant General R.

{"unnormalised": "It's also crucial to consider the context. In a highly formal military setting, strict adherence to rank and protocol is paramount. However, in more informal settings, such as after-duty hours or in casual conversations, the level of formality might be relaxed. Nevertheless, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and show due respect to their position. For example, addressing a \"Brig.\" as \"Brigadier Singh\" is correct, and in certain contexts, \"Sir\" is omitted but not in military functions or at headquarters. Also, remember that veterans who have retired, such as a \"Retd. Col. Joshi\", often appreciate being addressed by their former rank, particularly in gatherings related to the armed forces.", "normalised": "it is also crucial to consider the context. in a highly formal military setting, strict adherence to rank and protocol is paramount. however, in more informal settings, such as after-duty hours or in casual conversations, the level of formality might be relaxed. nevertheless, it is always best to err on the side of caution and show due respect to their position. for example, addressing a \"Brigadier\" as \"Brigadier Singh\" is correct, and in certain contexts, \"Sir\" is omitted but not in military functions or at headquarters. also, remember that veterans who have retired, such as a \"Retired Colonel Joshi\", often appreciate being addressed by their former rank, particularly in gatherings related to the armed forces."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, bear in mind the nuances of direct address versus referring to someone in the third person. While addressing someone directly, using \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" along with their rank is standard practice. When referring to them in conversation with others, use their full rank and name, such as \"Major Khanna\" or \"Air Marshal Verma.\" Avoid using overly casual terms or nicknames, especially in professional settings. Remember that showing respect for rank and position is integral to maintaining discipline and order within the Indian Armed Forces. Showing courtesy to a \"Capt.\" or a \"Sub. Lt.\" goes a long way.", "normalised": "finally, bear in mind the nuances of direct address versus referring to someone in the third person. while addressing someone directly, using \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" along with their rank is standard practice. when referring to them in conversation with others, use their full rank and name, such as \"Major Khanna\" or \"Air Marshal Verma.\" avoid using overly casual terms or nicknames, especially in professional settings. remember that showing respect for rank and position is integral to maintaining discipline and order within the Indian Armed Forces. showing courtesy to a \"Captain\" or a \"Sub Lieutenant\" goes a long way."}
