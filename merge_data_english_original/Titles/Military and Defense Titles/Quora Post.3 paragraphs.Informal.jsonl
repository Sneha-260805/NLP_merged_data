So, like, a Sepoy in the Indian Army is the equivalent of an Aircraftsman in the IAF or a Sailor in the Indian Navy. They are the starting point.

A Major General in the Army is kind of similar to a Vice Admiral in the Navy or an Air Marshal in the IAF, but their actual responsibilities would depend on their branch.
