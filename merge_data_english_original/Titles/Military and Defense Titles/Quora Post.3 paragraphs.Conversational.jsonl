{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me the other day about the difference between ranks like \"Col.\" and \"Brig.\" in the Indian Army. It's a good question! Basically, they are abbreviations for Colonel and Brigadier, respectively. Think of it like this: a Colonel is a senior officer who typically commands a battalion or a regiment, and a Brigadier is even more senior, usually commanding a brigade. You might see \"Lt. Gen.\" too - that's Lieutenant General, a very high-ranking officer.", "normalised": "Someone asked me the other day about the difference between ranks like \"Colonel\" and \"Brigadier\" in the Indian Army.

A Brig., on the other hand, has a broader strategic role. He is responsible for planning and executing operations in a larger area. Also important to remember: ranks like \"Maj. Gen.\" (Major General) and \"Capt.\" (Captain) also indicate specific levels of experience and responsibility within the Armed Forces.", "normalised": "Now, the specific responsibilities differ, of course. a Colonel is really focused on the day-to-day operations and training of the unit under their command. a Brigadier, on the other hand, has a broader strategic role.
