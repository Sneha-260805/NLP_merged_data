{"unnormalised": "Okay, so basically, a Col. is senior to a Lt. Col., and to get there, you gotta put in the years, clear your exams, and show you can lead a battalion effectively. Think of it like climbing a ladder, one step at a time. They're in charge of things at the battalion level, making sure everything runs smoothly. They need to have good people management skills, and a solid understanding of tactics and strategy.", "normalised": "Okay, so basically, a C-o-l-o-n-e-l is senior to a L-t C-o-l-o-n-e-l, and to get there, you got to put in the years, clear your exams, and show you can lead a battalion effectively.

{"unnormalised": "Now, a Brig. is a rank higher than a Col. and is essentially a one-star general. Getting to Brig. is a big deal; it's selection based on performance, experience, and potential. They usually command a brigade, which is a larger formation than a battalion. You're talking thousands of soldiers under their command. Also, they are often seen with the red gorget patches with the star on their collar! It's a pretty prestigious post to hold.", "normalised": "Now, a B-r-i-g-a-d-i-e-r is a rank higher than a C-o-l-o-n-e-l and is essentially a one-star general.

{"unnormalised": "The Brig. will have multiple Cols reporting to them. So, the responsibilities are way different. A Brigadier needs to think strategically, not just tactically.

{"unnormalised": "In short, a Colonel commands a battalion, a Brigadier commands a brigade. The Brig is a selection grade post while the Col is a time scale rank. Think of the Brig. as having more influence on the bigger picture, whereas the Col. is more focused on the day-to-day running of their battalion.
