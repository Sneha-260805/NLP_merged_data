Took science, because obviously, \"engineering is the only option!\" Scored decent marks in Physics, Chem, Maths, etcetera. All thanks to Professor Deshmukh's tuitions after school. Got that one from D.G. Ruparel College in two thousand and ten. Did reasonably well in C-E-T to get into good engineering college."}
