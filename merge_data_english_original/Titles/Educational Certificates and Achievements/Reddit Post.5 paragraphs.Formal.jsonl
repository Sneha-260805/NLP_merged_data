{"unnormalised": "I am especially interested in resources that consider the differences in title usage across different Indian institutions and regions. A “Dr.” in AIIMS might be different from a “Dr.” in a smaller private hospital, or the meaning could be the same but the way it is denoted might be different. Any guidance on how to effectively preprocess and normalize these diverse educational titles would be greatly appreciated.
