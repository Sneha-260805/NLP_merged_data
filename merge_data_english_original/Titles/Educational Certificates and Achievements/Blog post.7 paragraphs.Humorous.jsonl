{"unnormalised": "So, you've survived the gauntlet of Indian education, huh? Congratulations! You’ve earned the right to bore your relatives with tales of late-night study sessions fuelled by chai and existential dread. And what tangible proof do you have to show for it? Not just the crippling anxiety and the ability to sleep anywhere, anytime, but the legendary Indian marksheet! This isn't just a piece of paper; it's a family heirloom, a social barometer, and a potential blackmail tool all rolled into one. Prepare for a journey through the hallowed halls of academic validation… or at least a slightly damp photocopy thereof.", "normalised": "So, you've survived the gauntlet of Indian education, huh?

{"unnormalised": "First, let's talk about the sheer volume of paper we're talking about. From your 10th standard CBSE certificate, boasting a triumphant \"Pass\" (or a more nuanced \"Eligible for Improvement,\" which basically means \"try again, beta!\"), all the way to your Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Tech - alphabet soup for the soul), you’ve accumulated a veritable mountain of parchment. Stored carefully in those large, brown envelopes marked \"Important Documents. Do not fold!\", which invariably get folded anyway. Each marksheet is a snapshot of your past self, a testament to the hours (okay, minutes) you spent actually paying attention in class. And remember that \"Distinction\" you narrowly missed in Maths back in Class 8? Don't worry, your mother never will!", "normalised": "First, let's talk about the sheer volume of paper we're talking about.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the glorious smorgasbord of abbreviations. Forget decoding ancient hieroglyphs; try deciphering the cryptic shorthand on your transcript. What does \"S.G.P.A.\" actually stand for? Some Grandiose Performance Award? Slightly Grudgingly Passed Assessment? And don't even get me started on the electives. Who remembers what \"Environmental Studies 101\" even entailed? Probably something about saving the turtles while simultaneously trying to save your grades. My own marksheet reads like a coded message from another dimension, probably one where procrastination is a highly valued skill.", "normalised": "Then there's the glorious smorgasbord of abbreviations.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the all-important \"percentage.\" Oh, that magical number that dictates your future prospects, determines your worth as a human being (apparently), and sparks heated debates at every family gathering. Did you score 90%? You’re basically Einstein. 60%? Well, at least you’re employable... somewhere. Anything below that, and you’re destined to become a chaiwala, according to your concerned aunties.

{"unnormalised": "But beyond the academic achievements and the anxiety-inducing percentages, these certificates represent something more profound: the culmination of years of hard work (sometimes), sacrifice (mostly your parents'), and the unwavering belief in the power of education (even when you're questioning whether trigonometry will ever be useful in real life). They're a reminder of the friends you made, the lessons you learned (both inside and outside the classroom), and the person you became along the way.

Laugh at the absurdities, cringe at the embarrassing memories, and marvel at how far you've come.

Just be sure to keep them out of reach of your mom during marriage season – you don’t want her flashing your Class 10 marks to potential suitors!", "normalised": "So, the next time you stumble upon your old marksheets, take a moment to appreciate them.
