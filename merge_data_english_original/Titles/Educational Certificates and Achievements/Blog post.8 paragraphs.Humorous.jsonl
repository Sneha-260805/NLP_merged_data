{"unnormalised": "But hey, at least we have those fancy titles, right? All those years of studying for what? So you can sign your name \"Mr. Rakesh Sharma, MBA\" and feel marginally superior at the local chai stall. The chaiwala, bless his heart, probably doesn't care if you have a 'Ph.D. in Quantum Physics', as long as you pay the ₹10.", "normalised": "But hey, at least we have those fancy titles, right?

{"unnormalised": "But jokes aside, getting those degrees takes serious work. '10th standard' and '12th standard' board exams were no cakewalk. You pulled all-nighters, survived endless tuition classes, and probably lived on Maggi for a good portion of your student life. So, own that 'BA (History)' with pride! Even if all it qualifies you to do is argue about Bollywood movies with your friends.", "normalised": "But jokes aside, getting those degrees takes serious work.

{"unnormalised": "So, to all my fellow degree-holders, lets remember that those 'Certificates of Completion' and 'Diplomas in Civil Engineering' represent dedication and perseverance.

Or at least fix the damn TV remote.", "normalised": "So, to all my fellow degree-holders, let's remember that those 'Certificates of Completion' and 'Diplomas in Civil Engineering' represent dedication and perseverance.
