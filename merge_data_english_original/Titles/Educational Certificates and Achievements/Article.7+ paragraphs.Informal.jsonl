Think about it - PMP certification for project management, CCNA for networking, or a digital marketing certification from Google. These add serious value to your resume and can boost your career prospects. For instance, getting a certification from AWS could get you a raise of at least 15%. These can often cost around ₹10,000-₹30,000, give or take, depending on the institute and length of the course.
