{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's talk about degrees. A degree, like a B.A., B.Sc., B.Tech, M.A., or MBA, is typically awarded by a university or a deemed university after you complete a structured program of study lasting 3-4 years (sometimes longer, like for MBBS which is 5.5 yrs incl internship). Degrees often involve a broad curriculum, providing a comprehensive understanding of a subject area. Getting a degree from a recognized institution like IIT-Delhi or JNU really opens doors.", "normalised": "Firstly, let us talk about degrees. A degree, like a B. A., B. S. C., B. Tech, M. A., or M.

{"unnormalised": "Next, we have diplomas. Diplomas, particularly in India, tend to be more vocationally focused. A diploma program is shorter than a degree, usually 1-2 years, and emphasizes practical skills. Think of a Diploma in Engineering, offered by polytechnics, or a Diploma in Hotel Management from IHM. Diplomas are a good option if you want to quickly gain skills for a specific job, like a D. Pharm after 12th. The value lies in its practical application rather than theoretical depth. They’re often offered by institutions other than full-fledged universities, and can be a route to a lateral entry into a degree program later on.", "normalised": "Next, we have diplomas.

{"unnormalised": "Certificates, on the other hand, are generally the shortest and most specialized of the three. Certificate programs focus on a very specific skill or area of knowledge. These can range from a certificate in data science offered by NIIT to a certificate in a particular software from APTECH. These programs might last a few weeks to several months. A certificate demonstrates proficiency in a particular area. You might see professionals with degrees also obtaining certificates to demonstrate expertise, for example, a certificate in Project Management.", "normalised": "Certificates, on the other hand, are generally the shortest and most specialized of the three.
