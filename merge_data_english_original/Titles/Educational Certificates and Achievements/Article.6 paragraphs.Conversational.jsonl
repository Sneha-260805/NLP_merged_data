Earning the \"B.E.\" title after my name after 4 yrs felt great. I even have a separate certificate that mentions “First Class with Honours”! It hangs proudly on my wall, a reminder of all those late nights studying. I also earned a few extra certificates for winning inter-college coding competitions, all adding up to a pretty impressive resume, or so I thought back then.", "normalised": "Talking about college… those degree certificates!
