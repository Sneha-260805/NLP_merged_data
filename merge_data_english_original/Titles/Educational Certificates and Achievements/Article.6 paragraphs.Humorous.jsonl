{"unnormalised": "Ah, the glorious pursuit of higher education! In a country obsessed with marks, securing a \"good\" education is like winning the lottery, but instead of money, you get… more exams! Jokes aside, these days it seems like everyone's got a degree or two, or ten. It's almost as if we’re all competing to see who can collect the most expensive pieces of paper, framed and proudly displayed, silently judging our life choices.

You’ve got your standard B.Com, your MBA from IIM-A, and maybe even a cheeky little diploma in digital marketing from some random institute. But are these titles really the golden ticket to success? Or are we just perpetually stuck in student mode, forever chasing the next certification to avoid the existential dread of a 9-to-5? I remember a friend, Rahul, who proudly displayed \"Certified Excel Expert\" on his LinkedIn profile. Turns out, he only knew how to sum a column of numbers.
