{"unnormalised": "The problem with the modern academic transcript is how much information is crammed in there. Everything from the GPA to the university's official seal is important, but sometimes there are also odd items that somehow make it in there. In a transcript I saw last week, there was an annotation saying, \"attended campus from 2014-2018; please note: student never returned his overdue library book.\" Which really makes you think - did the university really have to include that?", "normalised": "The problem with the modern academic transcript is how much information is crammed in there.
