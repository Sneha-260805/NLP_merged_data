{"unnormalised": "In the realm of education, a student's achievements are often encapsulated in certificates, degrees, and awards. These documents, acting as tangible proof of dedication and skill, carry immense significance in shaping career trajectories. However, the lack of standardized titling across different institutions and regions in India presents a persistent challenge. This discrepancy can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, and even hinder recognition of qualifications, especially in a globalized context.", "normalised": "In the realm of education, a student's achievements are often encapsulated in certificates, degrees, and awards.

{"unnormalised": "The diversity of the Indian education system, while a strength in many respects, also contributes to this problem. From state boards to central boards, autonomous colleges to universities, each entity has its own nomenclature for degrees and certifications. For instance, what one institution might call a \"Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)\" in Computer Science, another might term it a \"B.Tech\" or \"B.S.\" (Bachelor of Science) in Computer Engineering. This seemingly minor difference can create ambiguity when employers or foreign universities evaluate a candidate's credentials.", "normalised": "The diversity of the Indian education system, while a strength in many respects, also contributes to this problem.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the use of abbreviations and acronyms, while convenient, adds another layer of complexity. Consider the common abbreviation \"M.Sc.\" for Master of Science. While widely understood, its meaning can vary slightly depending on the specific program or institution. Furthermore, the inclusion of honorifics like \"Dr.\" before the names of Ph.D. holders, while culturally appropriate, might not be universally recognized or understood in all contexts. Some educational institutions also award titles like \"Prof.\" to faculty who are not actually professors in the traditional sense.", "normalised": "Moreover, the use of abbreviations and acronyms, while convenient, adds another layer of complexity.

{"unnormalised": "The inconsistent use of titles extends beyond degrees to encompass professional certifications as well. A certificate in \"Data Science,\" for example, might be offered under various titles such as \"Certified Data Scientist,\" \"Data Science Professional,\" or simply \"Data Analyst.\" The lack of a universally accepted title makes it difficult to compare the qualifications of individuals holding seemingly similar certifications.

{"unnormalised": "One potential solution is to adopt a system similar to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), which provides a common reference point for comparing qualifications across different European countries.

By adopting a national framework, promoting clear language, and providing detailed program descriptions, we can ensure that the value of every qualification is accurately recognized and respected, both at home and abroad. This, in turn, will empower individuals to achieve their full potential and contribute to the nation's economic and social progress.", "normalised": "In conclusion, the standardization of titles for educational certificates and achievements is a critical step towards creating a more equitable and transparent education system in India.
