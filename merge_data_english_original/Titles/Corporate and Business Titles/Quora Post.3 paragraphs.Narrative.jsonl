Now, Sharmaji, err… Mr. Sharma, is a pretty chill guy, but I could see he wasn’t too impressed.", "normalised": "Someone asked me if it is really necessary to address people by their corporate titles in India.

{"unnormalised": "See, in India, corporate titles aren’t just fancy words; they represent experience, responsibility, and often years of hard work. Addressing someone as \"Mr. [Surname]\" or \"Ms. [Surname]\" when you know their official designation, like \"VP Marketing\" or \"Chief Tech Officer,\" shows a level of respect. It signals that you acknowledge their position and the effort they’ve put in to reach it. It's especially crucial in formal settings like client meetings or presentations. Imagine calling the CFO, Mr. Patel, just \"Patel Bhai\" in front of potential investors!", "normalised": "See, in India, corporate titles are not just fancy words; they represent experience, responsibility, and often years of hard work.

Calling someone \"Director Verma\" or \"Dr. Iyengar, Head of R&D,\" until they tell you otherwise, is always a safe bet. Remember my friend Radhika? She got a job at a multinational corporation and constantly referred to the CEO by his first name. Her manager, Ms. Kapoor, had to pull her aside to explain the company's culture.
