{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about the basics. You'll often hear \"CEO,\" which stands for Chief Executive Officer. They're basically the top boss, responsible for the overall strategic direction and success of the company. Think of them as the captain of the ship, steering the company through choppy waters. Then you have \"CFO,\" or Chief Financial Officer, who manages the company's finances. They're the ones ensuring the books are balanced and the company is making smart financial decisions. \"CTO,\" Chief Technology Officer, is crucial in tech-driven companies; they oversee the technological roadmap.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Now, things start to get interesting when we look at variations and regional adaptations. You might see \"Managing Director,\" especially in older Indian companies or those with a more traditional structure. This title often carries similar weight to CEO, but can sometimes have a more operational focus, particularly within family-owned businesses. Companies founded pre-liberalisation, or those based out of tier 2 cities, still use the \"MD\" title quite frequently.", "normalised": "Now, things start to get interesting when we look at variations and regional adaptations.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole VP (Vice President) landscape. In many multinational corporations (MNCs), the VP role denotes significant responsibilities and often manages multiple departments or large teams. However, in some Indian companies, especially startups, the \"VP\" title might be given more liberally. Someone with 5-7 years of experience could hold the title, even if their scope isn’t as broad as a VP in, say, a Fortune 500 company. Its kind of like seeing that someone with <4 years exp is a \"Manager\" at a small startup, it is not always what it seems like.", "normalised": "Then there is the whole V-P, Vice President, landscape.
