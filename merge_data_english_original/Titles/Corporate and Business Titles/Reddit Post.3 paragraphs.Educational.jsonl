{"unnormalised": "Hey Redditors, let's break down corporate and business titles in India. It can be a bit confusing, especially with the desi twist we often give them. Knowing the hierarchy helps understand who reports to whom and their level of decision-making power. For instance, a \"Sr. Manager\" usually has more experience and authority than just a \"Manager,\" and often manages a team. Understanding these differences can be super helpful when navigating the corporate world, whether you're interviewing, collaborating, or just trying to understand the org chart!", "normalised": "Hey Redditors, let's break down corporate and business titles in India.

{"unnormalised": "Often, you'll see \"Director\" and \"VP\" (Vice President) used somewhat interchangeably, but generally, a VP is a step above a Director. You might encounter someone with the title \"AVP\" (Asst. Vice President) which is a mid-level management role, often overseeing specific projects or functions. Also, remember the \"CxO\" suite! A \"CEO\" (Chief Executive Officer) is the top dog, while \"CFO\" (Chief Financial Officer), \"CTO\" (Chief Technology Officer), and \"CMO\" (Chief Marketing Officer) lead their respective departments. Knowing what these roles entail can help you understand the company's strategy and operations.", "normalised": "Often, you'll see Director and V-P (Vice President) used somewhat interchangeably, but generally, a V-P is a step above a Director.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, let’s touch on some local variations. While standardized titles are common in MNCs, smaller Indian companies may use titles differently. You might find someone called \"Proprietor,\" which is typically the owner of a small business, or \"Partner\" which signifies ownership stake, particularly in firms like law offices (e.g., \"Adv. Sharma & Partners\"). Sometimes, individuals are also addressed as \"CMD\" (Chairman and Managing Director), which shows they hold positions of both chairman and managing director in the company. Understanding these nuances is essential for grasping business etiquette and professional communication in India.
