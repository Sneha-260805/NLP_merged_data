{"unnormalised": "It's a common question and the answer isn't always straightforward, as organizational structures can vary across Indian companies. However, generally speaking, a VP (Vice President) typically reports to a Director. A Director often oversees a broader strategic area of the company, perhaps sitting on the board or directly influencing company policy. The VP, often, will handle a specific division or department within that Director's larger area of responsibility. Think of it as Director Sharma overseeing the entire marketing department, while VP Patel is responsible specifically for digital marketing within that department.", "normalised": "It is a common question and the answer is not always straightforward, as organizational structures can vary across Indian companies.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are exceptions. In some smaller startups or family-owned businesses, the titles might be used somewhat interchangeably or even inflated. You might find someone with the title \"Director\" managing a team of just 2-3 people, a role that might be considered a Manager or Senior Manager in a more structured company. Conversely, a highly specialized VP, say VP (Technology), could hold significant power and autonomy depending on their expertise and importance to the company’s success.
