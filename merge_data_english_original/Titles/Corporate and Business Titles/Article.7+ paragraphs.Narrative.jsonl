He explained, in painstaking detail, the intricacies of the balance sheet, the art of forecasting, and the subtle dance of corporate finance. He was always introduced as Mr. Sharma, never just Sharma, a sign of respect that felt almost old-fashioned in the rapidly modernizing India. He'd often say, \"Learn the basics well, beta.
