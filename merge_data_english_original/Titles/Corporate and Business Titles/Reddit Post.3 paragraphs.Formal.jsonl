{"unnormalised": "Currently, I'm functioning as the \"Head of Strategy\" for a mid-sized startup in Bangalore. Is \"Head of Strategy\" appropriate, or should I use something more formal like \"Chief Strategy Officer\" or \"VP, Strategic Initiatives\"? Also, if I’m corresponding with my CEO, Mr. Rajesh Kumar, should I be addressing him as Mr. Kumar in all instances, or is there an expectation of something less formal once you've been working with someone for 3 yrs+? Thoughts?", "normalised": "Currently, I'm functioning as the \"Head of Strategy\" for a mid-sized startup in Bangalore.

{"unnormalised": "My concern is coming across as too junior. I report directly to the CEO, Mr. R. Kumar, and oversee a team of 15 ppl. My responsibilities include long-term planning, market analysis, and M&A opportunities. Would a more senior title better reflect my responsibilities and level of authority? I'm also wondering if \"Director, Strategic Planning\" would be a good alternative in certain contexts. Any advice from Sr. Managers or VPs would be greatly appreciated.
