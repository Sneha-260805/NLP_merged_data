Let me tell you, as someone who's practically lived on their flights between Mumbai and Delhi for work, I've got some opinions.

{"unnormalised": "But, and this is a big but, once you get past the website woes, the in-flight experience is usually pretty decent. I've flown on the AI301 at 6:00 AM a bunch of times and surprisingly, it's usually on time. Plus, the food! Okay, maybe not Michelin star-worthy, but for airplane grub, it's not bad at all. They always seem to have good old masala chai available and that's a big win in my book. Give me that over some bland coffee any day.", "normalised": "But, and this is a big but, once you get past the website woes, the in-flight experience is usually pretty decent.

{"unnormalised": "The legroom? Well, let's just say if you're over 6 ft (like my colleague Rakesh), you might feel a little cramped.
