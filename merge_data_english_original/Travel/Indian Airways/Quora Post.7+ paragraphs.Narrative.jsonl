{"unnormalised": "Is flying with Indian Airways really worth it? My personal experience.", "normalised": "So, you’re thinking about booking a flight with Indian Airways, huh? I can definitely share my experience. My last trip with them was from Guwahati to Delhi, flight number six E-two hundred and three, scheduled on twentieth October two thousand and twenty three. I was a bit apprehensive, honestly. You hear all sorts of things, right? Delays, cramped seating, the whole shebang. I usually fly with SpiceJet or Air India, but Indian Airways had a way cheaper fare this time around. Like, rupee two thousand cheaper. That’s enough for a nice dinner!"}

There was a bit of a queue, maybe about fifteen minutes, but nothing too crazy. The staff seemed friendly enough, although the guy checking my I-D gave me the side-eye because my Aadhaar card photo is, well, let's just say it's not my best."}

The plane seemed reasonably clean, and the seats weren’t as cramped as I’d feared. Legroom was…sufficient. I’m five feet ten, and I wasn’t *completely* squashed. They didn’t offer complimentary meals, of course. Had to buy a soggy sandwich for rupee one hundred and fifty. Pro-tip: pack your own snacks. Also, the entertainment system was down. So no movies to distract me from the crying baby in twenty three B."}

The air quality was already hitting A-Q-I three hundred and fifty. But that’s not Indian Airways' fault, is it? Baggage claim was the usual circus. Took about thirty minutes for my suitcase to finally appear. I swear, those baggage handlers are playing Tetris with our belongings."}

The flight was delayed by one hour and forty five minutes. I got a notification on my phone about three hours before departure. Luckily, I hadn’t left for the airport yet. This seems to be a common complaint with them, looking at other Quora posts, honestly. If you are going for a really urgent matter like reaching A-I-I-M-S for an appointment at eight A-M, it's better to keep a buffer."}

If you’re on a tight budget and aren’t in a huge rush, then maybe. But if time is money, and you value your sanity, maybe shell out the extra cash for a different airline. Personally, I’d probably fly with them again if the price difference is significant, but I’d definitely prepone my arrival time to avoid any stress due to potential delays. Just manage your expectations, pack your own snacks, and pray for no crying babies."}
