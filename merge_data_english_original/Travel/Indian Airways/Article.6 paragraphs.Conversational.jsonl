Let's talk about Indian Airways, both the good and the slightly chaotic, to help you make an informed choice. I've personally flown with quite a few of them on my many trips, and this is based on my experience.", "normalised": "So, you're planning a trip within India? Awesome!

{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about the popular routes. Flights from Delhi (DEL) to Mumbai (BOM) are a dime a dozen. You can find multiple flights daily, sometimes even hourly, especially with Indigo and Air India. Prices can range from ₹3000 to ₹7000 depending on the time of year and how early you book. The same goes for Bangalore (BLR) to Delhi. These routes are usually well-maintained and have on-time performance. You can usually find a 6E flight or an AI flight easily.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about the popular routes. Flights from Delhi (D-E-L) to Mumbai (B-O-M) are a dime a dozen.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are the slightly more obscure routes. Trying to fly directly from, say, Guwahati (GAU) to Srinagar (SXR)? Good luck! You'll likely have a connecting flight through Delhi or Kolkata (CCU), adding hours to your journey. The flight times are longer, with layovers ranging from 2 hrs to 6 hrs. You’ll likely pay somewhere around Rs 8000- Rs 12000. I once got stuck in Delhi for 7 hrs!", "normalised": "Then there are the slightly more obscure routes.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's address the elephant in the room: delays. Indian Airways, while generally improving, still faces its fair share of delays, especially during monsoon season (June-Sept). It’s always wise to build a buffer, just in case your flight is delayed by 1 hr or 2 hrs. Always check the flight status online, preferably on the airline website itself!", "normalised": "Now, let's address the elephant in the room: delays.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, flying within India offers a vast network connecting even the remotest parts of the country. Just be prepared for potential delays, research your routes carefully, and book in advance, especially during peak season. And hey, maybe pack a book or two – you never know when you might need to kill some time at the airport! Happy travels!", "normalised": "Overall, flying within India offers a vast network connecting even the remotest parts of the country.
