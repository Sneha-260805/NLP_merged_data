{"unnormalised": "So, there I was, finally taking the plunge. After years of train journeys and painstakingly planned road trips across India, I decided to fly. A short hop from Delhi to Lucknow, just a 1.5 hr flight. SpiceJet seemed like a decent option, relatively affordable, and the timings worked.

{"unnormalised": "Gate no. 42 was packed, mostly with families heading home for the festive season. The initial boarding time of 7:00 AM came and went.

{"unnormalised": "Okay, “operational reasons” could mean anything. I grabbed a chai from a nearby stall (Rs. 100 – airport prices, you know) and tried to distract myself with a book. 8:00 AM arrived.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, at 8:30 AM, we started boarding. The plane was a Boeing 737-800, a bit older than I expected. Inside, the seats were…cozy. Let’s just say legroom wasn't a priority.

{"unnormalised": "Take-off was smooth, though. The pilot, Captain Sharma, gave a reassuring announcement, and we were airborne by 9:00 AM. The in-flight service was…minimal.

{"unnormalised": "We landed in Lucknow (LKO) around 10:15 AM, almost 3 hours behind schedule. Stepping off the plane, I felt a mix of relief and slight disappointment.

{"unnormalised": "So, that was my SpiceJet experience. A bit bumpy, a bit delayed, but ultimately, I got to my destination. Would I fly with them again? Maybe. If the price is right and I'm not in a hurry. But for now, I think I'll stick to the reliable old Indian Railways and those scenic 14-hour journeys. They might be longer, but at least they're usually on time (ish!). Plus, the view from the window is free!", "normalised": "so, that was my spice jet experience. a bit bumpy, a bit delayed, but ultimately, i got to my destination. would i fly with them again? maybe. if the price is right and i'm not in a hurry. but for now, i think i'll stick to the reliable old indian railways and those scenic fourteen-hour journeys. they might be longer, but at least they're usually on time (ish!). plus, the view from the window is free!"}
