I'd booked the ticket on 10/07/2024, expecting a reasonably comfortable journey. After all, it was a 9:00 AM flight, giving me the whole day to settle into Mumbai.

The announcement crackled through the Indira Gandhi International Airport at approximately 8:30 AM, informing us that the flight was delayed by 2 hours due to \"operational reasons.\" Of course, no further explanation was given, leaving a sea of frustrated passengers milling around Gate 5B. A quick scan of the departures board confirmed the bad news.

A young lady named Priya Sharma patiently answered everyone's queries, offering apologies for the delay and ensuring we had enough water and blankets.
