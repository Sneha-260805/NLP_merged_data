I swear, boarding an Air India flight is like stepping back in time… to the 1980s. And not in a cool, retro way. More like a “where’s the legroom and why is my seat sticky” kind of way.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let’s talk about Air India.

{"unnormalised": "First of all, the delays. Oh, the delays! I once waited 6 hrs at the Delhi airport for a flight to Bangalore. Six hours! I could’ve taken an auto-rickshaw (maybe). They are pretty good at prepone-ing flights when you're least expecting it. The announcement came over the loudspeaker with the urgency of someone announcing the arrival of chai. No explanation, just a casual \"Flight AI 404 to Bangalore is delayed indefinitely.\" Indefinitely! What does that even mean? Am I going to be stuck here until Diwali?", "normalised": "First of all, the delays. Oh, the delays! I once waited six hours at the Delhi airport for a flight to Bangalore. Six hours!

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the food. Airline food, in general, isn't exactly Michelin-star quality, but Air India takes it to a whole new level. My recent trip saw me served what I'm pretty sure was a slightly warmed-over mystery curry with the texture of wallpaper paste. And the dessert? A single, lonely gulab jamun that looked like it had seen better days. I'm starting to think they need a food taster. The portion size of gulab jamun was definitely smaller than 30 grams.", "normalised": "Then there's the food.

All viewed on a screen the size of a postage stamp.

Just go in prepared, with a sense of humor, a good book, and maybe a few extra snacks. And for the love of all that is holy, avoid the mystery curry. Happy flying! I'll be sure to bring a mask and hand sanitizer, and I'll try to forget I paid Rs. 12,000 for this experience.", "normalised": "So, yeah, Air India. It’s a mess. It’s unpredictable.
