Websites like MakeMyTrip and Yatra often have deals, but always compare with the airline's official site, for example, Air India (airindia dot in) or IndiGo (goindigo dot in). Look for fares listed as rupees two thousand five hundred onwards, but remember that prices fluctuate wildly, especially during peak season like Diwali or summer holidays. Booking forty five days in advance is generally a good idea for domestic routes. Also, keep an eye out for sales like the SpiceJet's \"Mega Monsoon Sale\" they often run, offering tickets as low as rupee nine hundred ninety nine (excluding taxes)."}

Most domestic airlines like Vistara allow fifteen kilogram check-in baggage and seven kilogram cabin baggage. Exceeding this will result in extra charges, typically around rupees three hundred per kilogram. Dimensions matter too! Cabin baggage should usually be less than fifty five centimeter by thirty five centimeter by twenty five centimeter. Always double-check the specific airline's policy on their website before you travel. For example, Alliance Air sometimes has different rules, so confirming is vital."}
