{"unnormalised": "My first flight was with Indigo, from Delhi to Guwahati. The website promised a smooth 2 hr flight. I was already dreaming of momos and Assam tea. Check-in was surprisingly painless, but then came the inevitable “gate change.” Gate 42B? No, wait, now it’s 48C! Classic. Eventually, we boarded at 14:30 IST, a whole 45 mins after the scheduled departure. But hey, who’s counting?

{"unnormalised": "Then there was the Air India flight from Mumbai to Kochi. Booked it months in advance, thinking I was all organised. Got to the airport, only to find out it was delayed by 3 hrs due to \"operational reasons.\" The announcement crackled over the loudspeaker, leaving everyone looking utterly bewildered. Luckily, the airport chai stall was open. Cost me Rs. 20, but it was a life saver.", "normalised": "Then there was the Air India flight from Mumbai to Kochi.

{"unnormalised": "The best (or should I say, most interesting?) part was trying to understand the baggage allowance. Apparently, 15 kg is the magic number for check-in baggage, and anything over that incurs a hefty fine. I swear my suitcase wasn't *that* heavy.

{"unnormalised": "But the real highlight was a tiny little regional carrier called TruJet, flying from Hyderabad to Tirupati. The plane felt like a vintage car, and the legroom was…minimal. The flight attendants were incredibly sweet, though, offering everyone a complimentary packet of Parle-G biscuits.

It's a reminder that travel is not just about the destination, but about the unexpected detours, the friendly faces, and the perfectly brewed cup of chai. Just remember to check your flight status (SG 234 or AI 501 or whatever it is) and keep a positive attitude. And maybe pack your own snacks.", "normalised": "Despite all the delays, gate changes, and questionable geographical claims, I wouldn't trade my Indian Airways adventures for anything.
