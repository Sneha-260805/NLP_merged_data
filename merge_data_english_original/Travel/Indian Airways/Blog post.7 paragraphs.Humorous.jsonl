No explanation, just a clock ticking slower than a government clerk on a Friday afternoon.", "normalised": "My recent trip from Guwahati to Bangalore was a classic Air India experience.

After 3 hrs of nail-biting and endless cups of chai (seriously, that lounge is a lifesaver), we finally boarded. The plane looked like it had seen better decades, but the seat was surprisingly comfy.", "normalised": "Turns out, technical issues.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the in-flight experience. The air hostess, bless her soul, tried her best, but the entertainment system seemed to be stuck in a loop of 90s Bollywood hits. And the food? Let's just say the \"vegetarian meal\" looked suspiciously like the non-vegetarian meal, only with a sadder complexion. But hey, free food is free food!", "normalised": "Then there's the in-flight experience.
