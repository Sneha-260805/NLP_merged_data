High fuel costs, fluctuating exchange rates, and stringent regulatory requirements all contribute to the sector's volatility. Furthermore, infrastructure bottlenecks at major airports like Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM) can lead to delays and congestion, impacting on-time performance. The government's UDAN scheme, aimed at enhancing regional connectivity, provides some support, but its long-term effectiveness remains to be seen.
