However, as I approached the boarding gate, chaos erupted. Apparently, the flight was delayed. No official announcement, just a bunch of confused passengers huddled around the gate agent, who looked like she hadn't slept in seventy two hours."}

Then, the captain announces (in a super casual tone, mind you), that we were experiencing \"slight turbulence\" and to keep our seatbelts fastened. Slight?

My carefully planned trip to Kamakhya temple was completely disrupted. And SpiceJet offered nothing – no apology, no voucher, not even a complimentary samosa! It’s experiences like this that make you question the sanity of early morning flights and also the reliability of some airlines."}
