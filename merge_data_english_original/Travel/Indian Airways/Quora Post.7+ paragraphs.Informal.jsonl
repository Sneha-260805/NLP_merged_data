They're adding new routes, like direct flights from Kochi to Dubai, and are trying to get rid of those ancient planes that feel like they're held together by duct tape and prayer. SpiceJet sometimes has ridiculously cheap fares, like Rs. 999 for a domestic flight (if you book way in advance and travel at 2 AM, maybe), and Vistara offers a slightly more premium experience.", "normalised": "But, to be fair, some Indian airlines are stepping up their game.
