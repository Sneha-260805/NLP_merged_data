{"unnormalised": "First off, the seating. Indigo touts legroom, right? Well, my nanaji's bullock cart had more legroom, okay maybe not, but you get my drift. It's enough that you are not touching the seat in front of you, if that helps. You feel like one of those chickens packed together for transport, but hey, at least you're getting somewhere, right? And instead of bumpy rural roads, you're soaring 30,000 ft in the air. Small mercies.", "normalised": "First off, the seating. Indigo touts legroom, right?

{"unnormalised": "The food, oh the food! You know that stale sandwich you find at the back of your fridge after a week? Indigo's food is… slightly better. Think of it as a culinary adventure, where the adventure is trying to identify what exactly you’re eating. Veggie puff? Chicken wrap? Mysterious substance in bread? Who knows! Embrace the mystery! Bring snacks, lots of them. Like, enough to feed a small village. Trust me on this one. I always bring two packets of lays and a bottle of water.", "normalised": "The food, oh the food!

{"unnormalised": "The on-time performance, they claim is their USP, but the flights are more \"Indian Standard Time\" than punctual. IST as we lovingly call it, is a theoretical time zone where time is merely a suggestion. The pilot might channel his inner Rajinikanth and land early, or you might spend an extra 2 hrs circling over Delhi because of \"technical difficulties.\" Who knows? That's part of the fun!

It's reliable in its own chaotic way. It’s like that friend who is always late, but always shows up in the end. So, is it a fancy auto-rickshaw? Maybe not fancy, but definitely an auto-rickshaw in the sky. So next time you want to travel from Delhi to Mumbai for ₹3000, book a ticket and embrace the chaos.
