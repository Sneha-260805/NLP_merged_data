I was trying to book a flight from BLR to DEL for a business trip next month, specifically on 18/11/2024, and the prices are all over the place. One minute it's Rs. 6500, the next it's bumped up to Rs 8000.

{"unnormalised": "I’ve been a loyal Indigo customer for yrs, primarily because of their extensive domestic network and relatively good on-time performance. However, this inconsistent pricing is making me reconsider my options. I've started checking Air India and SpiceJet as well, but Indigo usually has more convenient flight timings, such as the 6:00 AM or 7:00 AM flights that are perfect for reaching Delhi before noon.", "normalised": "I’ve been a loyal Indigo customer for years, primarily because of their extensive domestic network and relatively good on-time performance.

{"unnormalised": "I’ve heard rumours that the increase in fuel costs and air traffic control issues are to blame. But it seems like Indigo is leveraging its market dominance to exploit the demand. For example, a flight from CCU to BOM on 25/12/2024 is already showing prices starting at Rs 9000, even though it’s still several months away. This seems excessive.", "normalised": "I’ve heard rumors that the increase in fuel costs and air traffic control issues are to blame.

{"unnormalised": "I was hoping that the introduction of Akasa Air would bring some price competition, but so far, it hasn't made a significant difference on the major routes. The whole situation makes planning travel difficult and expensive, especially for business travelers like myself who need to book last-minute flights frequently. I often find myself prepone-ing or postpone-ing travel to grab a lower price.", "normalised": "I was hoping that the introduction of Akasa Air would bring some price competition, but so far, it hasn't made a significant difference on the major routes.
