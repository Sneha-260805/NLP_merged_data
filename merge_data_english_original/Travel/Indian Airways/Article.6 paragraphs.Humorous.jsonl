It's not just A to B; it's more like A to... maybe somewhere near B, possibly involving a detour through a relative's wedding in Nagpur. But hey, at least you'll have a story to tell, right? And maybe a complimentary samosa. Maybe.", "normalised": "Okay, let's be honest. Flying Air India is an experience.

Although, to be fair, you might stumble upon a Bollywood classic you’ve never seen before! Pro tip: pack a fully charged power bank and a good book. Or five. Flight AI 404, scheduled for 3:30 PM, might just leave near dinner time.", "normalised": "Then there's the in-flight entertainment.

{"unnormalised": "The food. Ah, yes, the food. It's either surprisingly delicious or... an adventure for your digestive system. There's no in-between. One time I got a paneer tikka masala that could have won awards, the next time it tasted suspiciously like it had been sitting in the cockpit since the 1970s. Best practice: lower your expectations, and pack some snacks. Preferably things that don't require refrigeration or too much chewing.", "normalised": "The food. Ah, yes, the food.

It's like that slightly eccentric uncle who always forgets your name but still gives you the best Diwali gifts. So next time you're booking a flight, consider the Maharaja.
