{"unnormalised": "Mainly concerned about two things: delays and comfort. Last time I flew AI to Delhi (from BOM), the flight was delayed by 3 hrs! So annoying! Don't want a repeat of that nightmare.

Worth the extra ₹3000, or nah?", "normalised": "Mainly concerned about two things: delays and comfort. Last time I flew A-I to Delhi (from B-O-M), the flight was delayed by three hours! So annoying!
