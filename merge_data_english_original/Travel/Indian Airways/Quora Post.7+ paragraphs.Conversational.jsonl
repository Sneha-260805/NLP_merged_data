{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the best airline for domestic travel in India. It really depends on what you're looking for, right? Like, are you prioritizing cost, comfort, or on-time performance? There's no single \"best\" answer, but I can give you my two cents from my experience.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the best airline for domestic travel in India.

{"unnormalised": "For budget travelers, IndiGo is often the go-to. They usually have the cheapest fares, especially if you book well in advance. I once got a ticket from Delhi to Bangalore for just Rs. 3500 booking 2 months prior! Just be aware that they charge extra for everything – meals, seat selection, even checking in a bag beyond the carry-on limit. Also, sometimes their customer service can be a bit slow, so keep that in mind.", "normalised": "For budget travelers, IndiGo is often the go-to.

{"unnormalised": "SpiceJet is another budget option, and I've found their legroom to be slightly better than IndiGo on some flights. Their deals are pretty good sometimes. I flew from Mumbai to Goa for around ₹4000 during the off-season, which was a steal. They've had some financial troubles in the past, which sometimes affects their on-time performance, so it's worth checking recent reviews before booking.", "normalised": "SpiceJet is another budget option, and I have found their legroom to be slightly better than IndiGo on some flights.

{"unnormalised": "If you're looking for a bit more comfort, Air India might be a better choice. They often have more spacious seating and complimentary meals on board. Plus, they have a wider network, including smaller towns and cities. I remember flying Air India from Kolkata to Guwahati and it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Although they’ve had their share of issues in the past, they're trying to improve their service under the Tata Group.", "normalised": "If you are looking for a bit more comfort, Air India might be a better choice.

I always check multiple websites like MakeMyTrip, Yatra, and the airline's own website before booking to compare prices and flight times.
