{"unnormalised": "One of the primary concerns for Indian Airways is the high cost of operations. Fuel accounts for a significant portion of an airline's expenses, and volatility in global oil prices directly impacts profitability. Moreover, airport charges and taxes contribute to the overall burden. Air India's privatization in Jan 2022 marked a pivotal moment, signaling the government's commitment to streamlining the sector and attracting private investment. Indigo continues to dominate the domestic market, holding approx. 55% market share.", "normalised": "One of the primary concerns for Indian Airways is the high cost of operations.
