{"unnormalised": "So, there I was, finally escaping Delhi's perpetual heat on a much-needed trip to Kerala. I’d booked an Indigo flight, 6E-203, departing IGI airport at 6:00 AM. I was excited to see the backwaters and stuff myself with yummy Kerala food. Little did I know, this journey would quickly devolve into a chaotic mess because of Indigo.", "normalised": "So, there I was, finally escaping Delhi's perpetual heat on a much-needed trip to Kerala.

{"unnormalised": "Check-in was smooth enough, surprisingly. Got my boarding pass, gate no. 52, and waited, sipping chai. The flight itself was fine, typical budget airline experience. But upon arriving at Cochin International Airport around 9:00 AM, the real fun began. My luggage, a bright blue suitcase (easily identifiable, I thought), was nowhere to be seen. The carousel kept churning out bags, but mine was missing.", "normalised": "Check-in was smooth enough, surprisingly. Got my boarding pass, gate number fifty two, and waited, sipping chai.

{"unnormalised": "Panic slowly started to set in. I approached the Indigo baggage claim counter. A tired-looking employee, looking really disinterested, told me to fill out a \"lost luggage report.\" Report number COK/BL/2345. Seriously? Like that would magically make my bag reappear. I did it anyway, of course. My suitcase contained, among other things, my mum's special homemade pickle that I was so looking forward to sharing with my aunt who lives in Kochi, clothes, toiletries, and gifts for my cousins. Basically, half my life.", "normalised": "Panic slowly started to set in. I approached the Indigo baggage claim counter.

{"unnormalised": "The Indigo staff offered little to no help. They were evasive and non-committal, claiming the bag was \"probably delayed\" and would arrive on the next flight, 6E-102, expected at 14:00 hours. Fine, I thought, I'll wait. I killed time wandering around the airport, feeling increasingly frustrated and helpless. 14:00 hours came and went. No luggage. More excuses from the Indigo staff. This time, the bag was \"misplaced\" at Delhi airport and they didn't have any updates.", "normalised": "The Indigo staff offered little to no help.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, after hours of stress and endless phone calls (the Indigo customer care number is a joke, btw – good luck getting through), they offered a measly Rs. 2000 \"compensation\" for the inconvenience. Seriously? Rs. 2000 wouldn't even cover the cost of replacing my basic toiletries. I refused, obviously. I demanded that they trace my bag and provide me with a concrete timeline. They said they'd \"look into it\" and get back to me within 24 hours. It's been 48 hours and counting. I'm still stuck wearing the same clothes I wore on the plane and relying on the kindness of my relatives to borrow things.", "normalised": "Finally, after hours of stress and endless phone calls (the Indigo customer care number is a joke, by the way – good luck getting through), they offered a measly rupee two thousand \"compensation\" for the inconvenience.

{"unnormalised": "Moral of the story? Think twice before flying Indigo, especially if you're checking in luggage. This experience has turned what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation into a logistical nightmare. I'm now seriously considering filing a formal complaint with the DGCA. Has anyone else had similar experiences with Indigo or other airlines? Any advice on how to escalate this further would be greatly appreciated. Learn from my mistake and maybe consider traveling with only a cabin baggage.", "normalised": "Moral of the story? Think twice before flying Indigo, especially if you're checking in luggage.
