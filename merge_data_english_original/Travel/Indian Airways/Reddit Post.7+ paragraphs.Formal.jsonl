{"unnormalised": "I've primarily flown with Indigo (6E) in the past. Their flights are usually on time, and the fares are reasonable. However, their seating can feel a bit cramped, and the overall experience is quite basic. I've heard mixed reviews about Air India (AI). Some people say it's improved a lot recently since the Tata takeover, but others still complain about delays and inconsistent service. Their aircraft, especially on domestic routes, can apparently be quite old. Has anyone flown with them recently and can share their experience?", "normalised": "I've primarily flown with Indigo (six-E) in the past.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's Vistara (UK). I've heard good things about their service and seat comfort, and the fact that they offer premium economy on some routes is tempting. However, their fares are typically higher than Indigo or Air India. Is the extra cost worth it? Also, what about SpiceJet (SG)? I remember reading a few concerning reports about safety incidents a while back. Are they still considered a safe airline to fly with? The last airline on my radar is GoAir (G8), which recently rebranded as Go First. They offer extremely low fares, but I'm a bit skeptical about what compromises they might be making in terms of maintenance or service.
