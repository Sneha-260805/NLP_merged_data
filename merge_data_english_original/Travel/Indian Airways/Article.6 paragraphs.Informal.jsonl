It's becoming easier than ever for folks like us to hop on a plane and explore the country. You can fly from Delhi to Goa for as low as Rs. 3500 sometimes – unbelievable! Of course, that's without the extra baggage or that complimentary sandwich they used to give out. Now, that's a bygone era.", "normalised": "The Indian aviation scene is buzzing, isn't it?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of airlines, SpiceJet's been in the news quite a bit lately. Remember that incident on 12/07/2023 where a flight had to make an emergency landing? Thankfully, everyone was safe. Then there’s Air India, trying to reinvent itself under the Tata banner. Heard they’re planning to add a whole bunch of new routes, maybe even direct flights to some smaller cities. That’ll be a game-changer for sure. Imagine flying direct from Guwahati to Jaipur!", "normalised": "Speaking of airlines, S-P-I-C-E-J-E-T's been in the news quite a bit lately.

{"unnormalised": "IndiGo, of course, remains the king of the skies. They seem to be adding new flights every other day! Their on-time performance is usually pretty good, around 85%, but sometimes you get stuck in a crazy delay at the airport. It’s all part of the charm, I guess. Remember that time I was stuck at the Bengaluru airport for 6 hours due to fog? Nightmare!

While the airline does offer a very comfortable experience, it is not always the most punctual. Additionally, tickets tend to be priced significantly higher than that of competitors like Indigo, often double or more.

There are some things that are infuriating such as a recent Air India flight AI-405 which had 10 hours delay, but generally it has become so affordable to explore different parts of the country.
