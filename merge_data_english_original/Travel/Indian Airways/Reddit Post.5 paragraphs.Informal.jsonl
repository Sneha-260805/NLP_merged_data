{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, anyone flown with Air India recently? Planning a trip from Delhi to Bangalore in Dec, around the 20th-ish. I'm seeing flights for around Rs. 6000, which seems alright, but I’m worried about the usual Air India delays. My last flight with them, AI-505, got delayed by like, 3 hrs! Missed my connecting bus and had to shell out extra for an auto. Total time waste!", "normalised": "Hey guys, anyone flown with Air India recently?

{"unnormalised": "I've heard Indigo is more reliable, but their prices are like, 2k more. Is it worth the extra dough for peace of mind? Also, how is the food on Air India these days? Last time I got something that tasted suspiciously like airplane food from the 80s. Seriously considering packing my own theplas this time around. Plus, their baggage allowance is 25 kg, right? Just wanna make sure I don't end up paying a fortune for extra luggage.", "normalised": "I've heard Indigo is more reliable, but their prices are like, two thousand more.

{"unnormalised": "Thinking of splurging for premium economy, just to avoid the mad rush for overhead bins. Saw a seat on flight AI-808 for around 8.5k, is it actually worth it for a domestic flight? Or am I better off saving the money and dealing with the chaos? I read a review saying their entertainment system is still stuck in 2010, so not expecting much there.", "normalised": "Thinking of splurging for premium economy, just to avoid the mad rush for overhead bins.
