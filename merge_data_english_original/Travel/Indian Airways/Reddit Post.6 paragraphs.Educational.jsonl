{"unnormalised": "First off, you've got the big players like IndiGo, often known for its punctuality. Their flight 6E 203 from Delhi to Mumbai is a super popular route. Then there's Air India, the OG national carrier. Now owned by the Tata group, they're undergoing a serious revamp, and you might snag some good deals on international routes connecting via their domestic network. Plus, they often have better baggage allowances – think 25 kg compared to the standard 15 kg on some budget airlines.", "normalised": "First off, you've got the big players like IndiGo, often known for its punctuality.

{"unnormalised": "SpiceJet is another option, known for its slightly smaller fleet and often serving tier 2 and tier 3 cities. I once flew SpiceJet flight SG 401 from Hyderabad to Vijayawada, and it was a perfectly fine, no-frills experience. Vistara, a Tata-SIA joint venture, positions itself as a premium airline with enhanced services, offering things like wider seats and better meals – their flight UK 991 is a daily from Delhi to Bangalore. They are good if you want a slightly more comfortable experience for long duration flights.", "normalised": "SpiceJet is another option, known for its slightly smaller fleet and often serving tier two and tier three cities.

{"unnormalised": "Now, when comparing prices, remember to factor in extra costs! A ticket on GoAir (now Go First, though they're facing some financial turbulence) might seem super cheap at Rs. 2500, but then you add baggage fees, seat selection (Rs. 200), and maybe even a meal (Rs. 500), and suddenly it's not such a steal anymore. Airlines like AirAsia India (now AIX Connect, and merging with Air India Express) often have attractive base fares. It's all about doing the math!", "normalised": "Now, when comparing prices, remember to factor in extra costs!
