These aggregators allow you to compare prices and schedules across different airlines. Alternatively, you can book directly through the airline's website or mobile app. For example, IndiGo's website, goindigo.in, is quite user-friendly. Always compare prices across multiple platforms before finalizing your booking to snag the best deal.
