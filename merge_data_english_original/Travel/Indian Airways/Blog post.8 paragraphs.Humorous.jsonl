Like, seriously, if you’re planning a trip for Diwali on 01/11, book it now. No, seriously, stop reading and book it now! Otherwise, you’ll be paying Rs. 20,000 for a one-way ticket or, worse, stuck in your in-laws’ house for an extra week.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the check-in. Online check-in? Sure, it *exists*. But will it work? Maybe. Will your seat actually be the one you selected? Probably not. I once “pre-booked” a window seat only to find myself sandwiched between a snoring uncle and a baby who thought my armrest was a teething toy. Good times! Allow at least 2 hrs at the airport, esp at DEL or BOM. You'll need it.", "normalised": "Then comes the check-in. Online check-in? Sure, it exists. But will it work? Maybe.

And if you happen to be on a budget airline, be prepared to pay for everything. Like, even air. Okay, I’m exaggerating. But not by much. You might get a complimentary glass of water or maybe a biscuit, but that’s about it. Upgrade to Air India if you value your knees.", "normalised": "Now, the flight itself. Legroom? What legroom?

{"unnormalised": "Food. Airline food. Enough said. But seriously, pack your own snacks. Because even if you pre-ordered that gourmet meal (for an extra Rs. 500, mind you), there’s a 50/50 chance they’ll have “forgotten” to load it. Or they'll give you something totally different. One time, I ordered a vegetarian meal and got chicken. Chicken! The horror! Thank goodness for my emergency stash of Parle-G biscuits.", "normalised": "Food. Airline food. Enough said.

{"unnormalised": "But despite all the chaos, the questionable food, and the existential dread of delayed flights, there’s something undeniably charming about flying Indian Airways. Maybe it’s the sheer absurdity of it all. Maybe it's the fact that you’ll inevitably have a story to tell. Or maybe it's just the relief of finally reaching your destination in one piece. Whatever it is, flying Indian Airways is an experience you won't soon forget. Just remember to pack your snacks, your patience, and maybe a good book. And try to find the humour in it all.
