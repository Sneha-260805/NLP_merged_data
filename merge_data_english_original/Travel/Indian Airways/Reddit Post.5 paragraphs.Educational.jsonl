{"unnormalised": "First off, you've got the big players. Air India, now back with Tata, is kinda the OG. They often have good connections and fly to tons of domestic locations, but sometimes their planes are a bit older, and the service can be hit or miss. Think of them as the reliable uncle who sometimes forgets your birthday. Then there's IndiGo, which is usually the cheapest. They're super punctual, like 90% on time (maybe I'm exaggerating but they're really good). Good for short hops, Mumbai to Bangalore, that kinda thing.", "normalised": "First off, you have got the big players. Air India, now back with Tata, is kind of the O-G.

{"unnormalised": "SpiceJet is another option, often with decent prices, but they've had some financial turbulence lately, so keep an eye on the news before booking. Vistara is often positioned as a premium option, with a bit more legroom and generally better service – a good option if you're flying from Delhi to Goa and want a slightly more comfortable experience. Consider the fare differences though - is paying Rs. 2000 extra worth it for that legroom?", "normalised": "SpiceJet is another option, often with decent prices, but they have had some financial turbulence lately, so keep an eye on the news before booking.

{"unnormalised": "Remember to always check baggage allowances! IndiGo might lure you in with a cheap base fare of Rs. 3500, but then charge extra for everything else. Most airlines allow 15 kg check-in baggage in economy. Also, keep an eye out for sales. Airlines like to have flash sales around holidays like Diwali and Holi. Booking 2-3 months in advance can often snag you a better deal.", "normalised": "Remember to always check baggage allowances!

{"unnormalised": "Finally, a quick tip: download the airline's app. Makes check-in and boarding a whole lot easier. Many also provide real-time flight status updates, so you'll know if your 6:00 AM flight is delayed or not. Happy flying, and remember to book your tickets well in advance, especially if you're travelling around peak season like summer vacation!", "normalised": "Finally, a quick tip: download the airline's app. Makes check-in and boarding a whole lot easier.
