{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, flying Air India is a rite of passage for any true Indian. It's a masterclass in patience, a test of your faith in the concept of \"on-time performance,\" and a guaranteed conversation starter with anyone who's ever dared to book a ticket. My own experience with flight AI-301 from Delhi to Guwahati on 23/07/2023 comes to mind, delayed by a mere 6 hours, they said, because of “technical difficulties”. Which, I suspect, is Air India’s polite way of saying, “We misplaced a crucial part of the plane, probably somewhere near a chai stall.”", "normalised": "Let's be honest, flying Air India is a rite of passage for any true Indian.

{"unnormalised": "One could write an entire saga on the sheer artistry of Air India's delays. They’re not just late; they're conceptually late. Like, the plane leaves tomorrow, but still feels like it should’ve left yesterday kind of late. The gate announcements sound like they're being delivered by someone reading a haiku, leaving you to decipher whether the flight is actually boarding, delayed, or has simply ascended to another dimension. I’ve spent more time in airports thanks to Air India than I’ve spent actually flying, which, at this point, qualifies me as an honorary terminal resident.", "normalised": "One could write an entire saga on the sheer artistry of Air India's delays.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the food. Ah, the in-flight meals. They're less about sustenance and more about… well, I'm not entirely sure what they're about. Sometimes it resembles something edible, and other times it looks like a science experiment gone horribly wrong. The tiny packets of salt and pepper, though, are a constant source of entertainment. Trying to open them without covering yourself and your fellow passengers in seasoning is a challenge worthy of the Olympics. One time, my bread roll was so hard, I swear it could have doubled as a weapon. I estimated its value at ₹50, only because it could probably survive a nuclear holocaust.", "normalised": "And then there's the food. Ah, the in-flight meals.

{"unnormalised": "But here’s the funny thing: despite all the chaos, the delays, and the existential food, there's a certain charm to Air India. The air hostesses, bless their hearts, are usually incredibly sweet and patient, even when dealing with passengers who’ve reached peak delay-induced delirium. The announcements, however cryptic, are delivered with a certain theatrical flair. And the feeling of finally touching down after a bumpy, extended flight is a unique kind of relief – the kind you only experience after surviving a slightly absurd ordeal.", "normalised": "But here’s the funny thing: despite all the chaos, the delays, and the existential food, there's a certain charm to Air India.

If the answer to all of these questions is yes, then book your ticket now. Just be sure to pack a good book, a sense of humor, and maybe a backup snack or two. And maybe a prayer. You’ll need it. After all, they are now owned by the Tatas, and one can only hope that they'll iron out these issues, and bring some sorely needed normalcy to the airline!", "normalised": "So, would I recommend flying Air India?
