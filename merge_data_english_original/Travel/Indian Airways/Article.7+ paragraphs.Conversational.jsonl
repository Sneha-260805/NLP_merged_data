{"unnormalised": "Let's start with Indigo. Known for its punctuality and extensive network, Indigo is often the go-to choice for many. Their flights are frequent and cover a vast range of domestic destinations. Ticket prices are generally competitive, especially if you book in advance. Plus, they often have sales where you can snag a flight for as low as Rs. 999! Keep an eye out for those deals! However, be aware that extra services like meals and seat selection come at an additional cost. If you're travelling with just a cabin bag, weighing under 7 kgs you should be fine.", "normalised": "Let's start with Indigo.

{"unnormalised": "SpiceJet is another budget airline vying for your attention. They frequently offer promotional fares, sometimes even lower than Indigo. SpiceJet is known for connecting smaller cities and towns, making them a good choice for reaching less accessible destinations. I once got a ticket from Delhi to Guwahati for just Rs. 1500 during a flash sale. But remember to check the baggage allowance and read the fine print. You might find that what seems like a super-cheap fare quickly adds up with extra charges.", "normalised": "SpiceJet is another budget airline vying for your attention.
