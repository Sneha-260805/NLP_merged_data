Awesome! But navigating the world of Indian Airways can be a bit… well, let us just say “interesting.” I have flown domestically more times than I can count (seriously, ask my travel agent!), and I have learned a few things along the way. Figured I would share some of my hard-earned wisdom, especially if you are a first-timer. Think of this as your “Indian Airways Survival Guide.”"}

I usually check prices on sites like MakeMyTrip or Yatra dot com. You will see options from Indigo, SpiceJet, Air India, and Vistara (they merged, B-T-W, effective first january two thousand and twenty four, I think). Keep an eye out for deals, especially during off-season. Airlines often have flash sales, but they disappear faster than my patience at airport security. Pro-tip: booking forty five days in advance often gets you the best fares."}

It is like seeing a vada pav for rupee ten and then realizing you need to pay extra for the chutney. Airlines love to add on charges. Baggage is a big one. Indigo charges approximately rupee four hundred extra if you exceed the fifteen kilogram check-in limit. And meals? Forget about gourmet dining. Pack some snacks – trust me on this. Unless you are flying Vistara, which offers slightly better grub, but at a premium."}

Queues can be long, especially at peak times like six zero zero A-M or during Diwali holidays. And then there is the weighing. They are super strict! Even a kilo over can cost you. I once saw a guy unpack his entire suitcase at the counter, trying to redistribute the weight. It was… a sight. Do not be that guy. Invest in a luggage scale (they are like, rupee five hundred on Amazon)."}

Do not expect the luxury of Emirates. Legroom is usually tight (especially if you are six feet like my bhai), and the in-flight entertainment is limited. Download some movies or podcasts beforehand.

Claiming your baggage? That is where the real test of patience begins. It can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to forty five minutes for the bags to appear.
