{"unnormalised": "Planning a trip within India? With so many airways to choose from, it can get a bit confusing, right? Let's break down some popular options and what to expect. You've got the big players like IndiGo and Air India, but also some smaller ones like SpiceJet and Vistara. Each has its own perks and drawbacks, especially when you're looking at things like on-time performance (OTP). I heard IndiGo flights are usually on time around 80% of the time!", "normalised": "Planning a trip within India? With so many airways to choose from, it can get a bit confusing, right?

{"unnormalised": "First off, Air India. It's the OG, right? But honestly, their service can be a bit inconsistent. Sometimes you get amazing service, other times... not so much. They’ve got pretty good coverage across India, especially for smaller cities. They are supposed to offer flights to over 60 destinations across India. I remember seeing a flight from Delhi to Guwahati advertised for ₹6000 a while back.", "normalised": "First off, Air India. It's the O-G, right? But honestly, their service can be a bit inconsistent.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's IndiGo – the king of budget travel. They're known for their punctual flights, and usually have the most options, especially if you’re flying between major cities like Mumbai and Bangalore. But be warned, their legroom can be a bit tight if you're tall like me! They've got a massive fleet of A320s and A321s. I think it's over 300 aircraft!", "normalised": "Then there's IndiGo – the king of budget travel.

{"unnormalised": "SpiceJet is another budget option. They often have really cheap fares, sometimes even lower than IndiGo. Keep an eye out for their sales around Diwali! But they've had some financial troubles in the past, so it's always good to check the latest news before booking. I once saw a Delhi-Goa flight on SpiceJet for just Rs. 3500 during a flash sale.", "normalised": "SpiceJet is another budget option.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, there's Vistara – if you're looking for a bit more luxury. They offer a premium experience with better seats, meals, and service. They're a bit more expensive, of course, but if you want to treat yourself, it might be worth it. Their business class is pretty swanky. Check their website; they usually have offers starting around ₹9000 for economy class on certain routes. So, happy travels around India!", "normalised": "Finally, there's Vistara – if you're looking for a bit more luxury. They offer a premium experience with better seats, meals, and service.
