{"unnormalised": "Okay, so planning a road trip across North India on a budget can be super exciting! First off, think about when you wanna go. Avoiding peak tourist season (like Diwali or summer holidays) can save you a ton of ₹ on accommodation and even petrol. Plus, less crowded roads make the drive way smoother.

{"unnormalised": "Next, your ride is key. If you don't own a car, consider renting a reliable hatchback. Something like a Maruti Suzuki Swift or Tata Tiago. They’re fuel-efficient and easy to handle on most Indian roads. Daily rentals can range from Rs. 1200 to Rs. 2000, depending on the rental company and the season. Make sure the car has all the necessary papers and permits for interstate travel. Also, factor in toll charges – they can add up! Use apps like Google Maps or Mappls to estimate toll costs beforehand.", "normalised": "Next, your ride is key. If you do not own a car, consider renting a reliable hatchback.

{"unnormalised": "Accommodation-wise, ditch the fancy hotels! Look for guesthouses, homestays, or budget-friendly hotels on sites like MakeMyTrip or Booking.com. You can often find decent rooms for around Rs. 800-1500 per night. And don't be shy about bargaining – especially if you're traveling during the off-season. Eating local is a must! Dhabas offer delicious and affordable meals. A plate of chole bhature will set you back maybe Rs. 50-80, and it’s way more authentic than the stuff you get in restaurants.", "normalised": "Accommodation wise, ditch the fancy hotels!

{"unnormalised": "Finally, plan your route carefully. North India is vast! Focus on a specific region, like Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh, to avoid spending all your time driving. Places like Jaipur, Udaipur, Shimla and Manali are popular choices. Factor in travel time between cities (Indian roads can be unpredictable!), and don't forget to factor in buffer time, like an extra 2 hours per day. And remember to carry enough cash, since ATMs aren't always available in remote areas. Happy road tripping, bhai!", "normalised": "Finally, plan your route carefully. North India is vast!
