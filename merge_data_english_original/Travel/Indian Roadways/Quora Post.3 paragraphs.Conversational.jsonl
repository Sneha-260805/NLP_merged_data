For example, a drive from Delhi to Agra via the Yamuna Expressway is a breeze, maybe 3–4 hours (approx. 240 km). But tackling the Northeast? That's a whole different ballgame.

{"unnormalised": "Road conditions are key. NH44 (the north-south corridor) is generally good, but expect tolls. A FASTag is almost essential these days, saves a ton of time. If you're hiring a car, double-check the paperwork and insurance. Also, learn some basic Hindi phrases – it can really help in smaller towns. Don't rely solely on Google Maps; sometimes local advice is best. My cousin drove from Mumbai to Goa last year (approx. 600 km) and said the coastal route was beautiful, but took closer to 14 hrs because of the traffic near Panvel.", "normalised": "Road conditions are key.

Carry water and snacks, especially if you're travelling in remote areas. A power bank for your phone is a must. Remember to check weather forecasts, especially if you’re planning a trip involving mountain passes or coastal regions that are prone to cyclones. And if you're planning to drive, say, 1200 km over 2 days, plan for breaks and sharing the driving with someone if possible. Happy travels!", "normalised": "Finally, safety first!
