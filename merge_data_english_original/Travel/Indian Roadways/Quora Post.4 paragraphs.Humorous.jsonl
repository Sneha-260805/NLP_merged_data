{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're asking about the best way to tackle Indian roads, eh? Buckle up, bhai! It's less about the destination and more about the… experience. Seriously though, driving in India is like participating in a real-life video game, except instead of points, you get near-death experiences. You'll encounter everything from rogue cows chilling in the middle of NH48 to auto-rickshaws playing chicken with buses. And don't even get me started on the potholes – they're practically historical landmarks at this point.", "normalised": "Okay, so you're asking about the best way to tackle Indian roads, eh?

The horn is your best friend, your therapist, your way of saying \"I'm here, deal with it!\" Also, invest in a good dashcam; you'll need the evidence when you inevitably encounter a traffic dispute over who has the right of way at a 5-way intersection (spoiler alert: no one does). Remember that the speed limit of 60 kmph is more of a polite suggestion than a hard rule.", "normalised": "Firstly, forget everything you learned in driving school.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the specifics. If you're planning a road trip from say, Delhi to Jaipur, be prepared for anything. You might encounter a camel cart holding up traffic, a wedding procession blocking the highway, or a sudden swarm of goats. Always carry water, snacks (especially biscuits - Parle G is your savior), and a good sense of humor. Check your tyre pressure (aim for 32 PSI) before you set off. Also, download offline maps because internet connectivity on some stretches can be worse than dial-up from 1998.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the specifics.
