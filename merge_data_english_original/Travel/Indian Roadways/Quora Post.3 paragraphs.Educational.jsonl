{"unnormalised": "India offers amazing road trip opportunities! First, remember that road conditions vary greatly. National Highways (NH) are generally good, but state highways and rural roads can be unpredictable. Always check the latest road advisories, especially during monsoon. A journey from Mumbai to Goa on NH 66 during the rains might take significantly longer than expected, perhaps adding 4-5 hours to your ETA.", "normalised": "India offers amazing road trip opportunities!

{"unnormalised": "Second, plan your route carefully, factoring in distances and driving times. Google Maps can be helpful, but local knowledge is invaluable. Also, be aware that distances in India are often quoted in kilometers (km). For example, Delhi to Agra is roughly 240 km, but that doesn't mean it's a quick drive. Consider booking accommodations in advance, especially during peak seasons like Diwali or Christmas. Many dhabas along the NH-1 offer decent food and rest stops.", "normalised": "Second, plan your route carefully, factoring in distances and driving times.

Always keep some cash handy, as not all toll plazas or smaller establishments accept online payments. A road trip from Bangalore to Kerala covering about 600 km can be a memorable experience if planned well.
