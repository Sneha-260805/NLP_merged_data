{"unnormalised": "Last month, I took a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur. Started at 6 AM sharp, hoping to beat the traffic. The NH48 was surprisingly decent until Gurgaon. Post that, it was a total mess, took us almost 3 hrs to cross. Had a quick breakfast at a dhaba near Manesar, paid Rs. 300 for 2 parathas and chai. Reached Jaipur by 2:30 PM, pretty exhausted! Next time, I'm taking the train; that 5 hr journey seems much better than this 8+ hr ordeal.", "normalised": "Last month, I took a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur.
