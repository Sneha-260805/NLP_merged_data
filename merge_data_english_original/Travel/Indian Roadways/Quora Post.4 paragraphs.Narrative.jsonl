{"unnormalised": "Is it safe to drive from Bangalore to Goa by road? What are some things to keep in mind?", "normalised": "Driving from Bangalore to Goa is a classic Indian road trip, something many folks prepone during the monsoon season after the rains subside a bit. I did it last year, in October two thousand and twenty three, and it was quite an experience! The total distance is about six hundred kilometer via N-H forty eight, and it took us roughly twelve hours, including chai breaks and lunch."}

Some stretches are fantastic, especially after Chitradurga. But near the Goa border, the roads can get quite bumpy. Keep an eye out for those surprise potholes! Also, a lot of truck traffic, especially after dark. We started at five double zero A-M from Bangalore to avoid the city traffic, and that helped a lot. Remember to carry your driver's license; the cops can be quite strict, especially around Hubli."}

We saw a couple of accidents on the way back, and it's just safer to drive when you can see clearly. Avoid rash driving, especially on those ghat sections near Goa. Keep your speed under eighty kilometer per hour on average, even if the highway seems clear. And make sure your car is in good condition before you start! Get it serviced at least one week prior at your local Maruti service centre."}

The scenery is beautiful, especially as you get closer to Goa. Stop at some local dhabas along the way for some delicious food. There's a great one near Belgaum that serves amazing mirchi bhajji for just rupee thirty a plate! Just be mindful of the road conditions and drive safely, and you'll have a fantastic trip."}
