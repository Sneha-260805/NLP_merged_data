It's officially the longest highway in India. Always good to check road conditions beforehand, especially during the monsoon season. Heard NH16 (Kolkata to Chennai) and NH48 (Delhi to Chennai) are also pretty good, but can get crowded.", "normalised": "Hey R slash India!

Expect to pay tolls every ~50-60 km on some stretches, can add up. Also, driving times can be longer than expected because of traffic, especially near big cities. A 300 km trip can easily take 6-7 hrs.", "normalised": "One thing to remember is toll booths! Fastag is pretty much mandatory now on most national highways. Makes the journey smoother.
