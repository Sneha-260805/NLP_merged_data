{"unnormalised": "For shorter distances, state transport buses are usually the cheapest option. I've taken many a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus from Pune to Mumbai – costs around Rs. 500 and takes about 4 hrs, give or take. Private buses are a bit more comfy, maybe Rs. 800-Rs. 1200 for the same route. For longer routes, look at Volvo or Scania buses. They're pricier, but you get AC, reclining seats, and maybe even a movie! Remember to book in advance, especially during Diwali or other festivals. RedBus or similar apps are your friends.", "normalised": "For shorter distances, state transport buses are usually the cheapest option.

{"unnormalised": "Driving yourself is great for flexibility, but India's roads can be... interesting. From Mumbai to Goa, it's a scenic drive, but be prepared for toll booths and varying road conditions. Total distance is approx. 600 km. A lot of folks also rent cars or hire a driver. This can be a good middle ground if you want some control but don't want the hassle of driving the whole way. Just ensure your driver has a valid license and knows the route. Safe travels, bhai!", "normalised": "Driving yourself is great for flexibility, but India's roads can be... interesting.
