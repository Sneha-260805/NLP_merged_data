{"unnormalised": "Travelling via roadways in India, while offering scenic views, is often fraught with challenges. One significant problem is the inconsistent road quality. You might encounter stretches of well-maintained highways intermixed with badly-potholed roads, especially on state highways and rural routes. For example, NH 44 from Srinagar to Kanyakumari is generally good, but certain sections near MP have issues. Also, unpredictable traffic adds to the woes. Expect delays due to congestion in cities like Bangalore and Chennai, especially during peak hours (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM).", "normalised": "Travelling via roadways in India, while offering scenic views, is often fraught with challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another prevalent concern is the erratic driving behaviour of some motorists. Overtaking on blind curves, ignoring traffic signals, and speeding are common sights. While initiatives like increased traffic police patrolling and stricter enforcement of rules are underway, such as the amended Motor Vehicles Act of 2019, their efficacy varies across states. Furthermore, the lack of adequate rest stops and clean public conveniences along many highways is a significant inconvenience. Many 'dhabas' do exist, but hygiene is sometimes questionable. Finding a decent washroom can be a challenge, especially for female travellers on routes like the Delhi-Jaipur highway (NH 48).", "normalised": "Another prevalent concern is the erratic driving behaviour of some motorists.

For instance, entering Maharashtra from Karnataka might require payment of a toll of Rs. 200, and commercial vehicles often need special permits. Ensuring all vehicle documents are in order (registration, insurance, PUC etc.) is crucial to avoid hassles with the authorities. Proper planning, a well-maintained vehicle, and awareness of these challenges can significantly enhance your travel experience on Indian roadways.", "normalised": "Finally, be wary of unexpected toll charges and permit requirements, particularly when crossing state borders.
