{"unnormalised": "Hey there! Planning a long drive across India? Awesome! It's an incredible experience, but definitely needs some prep. First off, get your vehicle checked thoroughly. I mean, really thoroughly. Get the oil changed, tires checked (pressure and tread), and fluids topped up. Nothing ruins a trip faster than a breakdown in the middle of nowhere (trust me, I learned this the hard way near Nagpur a few years back!). Consider carrying a basic toolkit and spare tire, too. Also, plan your route in advance. Use Google Maps, but remember Indian road conditions can change rapidly. Always factor in extra time, especially if you're travelling during monsoon season. Expect delays.", "normalised": "Hey there! Planning a long drive across India? Awesome! It's an incredible experience, but definitely needs some prep. First off, get your vehicle checked thoroughly.

{"unnormalised": "Next up, let's talk documents. Make sure you have a valid driving license, registration certificate (RC), insurance papers, and PUC certificate for your vehicle. Keep photocopies in a separate bag in case the originals get misplaced. Also, if you're crossing state borders, you might need permits. Check the specific rules for the states you're passing through – it can save you a lot of hassle at checkpoints. Remember your Aadhar card too! Keep some cash handy as many toll plazas and smaller eateries might not accept digital payments. Carry about Rs. 2000-3000.", "normalised": "Next up, let's talk documents.

{"unnormalised": "Safety first, always! Drive defensively. Indian roads can be unpredictable, with everything from cows to overloaded trucks sharing the space. Don't over-speed; stick to the speed limits (usually around 80 kmph on highways, but always check). Take regular breaks – driving for more than 2-3 hours at a stretch can be tiring. Share the driving if possible. Also, be extra cautious while driving at night. Visibility can be poor, and you might encounter unmarked speed breakers or potholes. A good rule of thumb is, stop driving by 10 PM and find a reasonable place to sleep.", "normalised": "Safety first, always! Drive defensively.
