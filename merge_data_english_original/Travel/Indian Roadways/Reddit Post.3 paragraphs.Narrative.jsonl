Started at 7:00 AM sharp from Bangalore, figuring we'd beat the city traffic. BIG mistake.

Ordered idli and vada; cost us only Rs. 250 for four people – can’t beat that! After that, the drive got a bit monotonous, honestly. Spotted a bunch of those KSRTC buses speeding past; those guys are fearless!", "normalised": "The highway itself (N-H two hundred and seventy five) was mostly okay, some patches were a bit rough, especially after Mandya.
