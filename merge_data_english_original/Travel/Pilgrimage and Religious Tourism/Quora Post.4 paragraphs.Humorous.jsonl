{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you wanna do the Char Dham Yatra but your wallet's lookin' thinner than a wafer biscuit? Don't worry, bhai, I got you covered. First things first, avoid peak season like it's a Bollywood dance-off – prices for everything from dharamshalas to rickshaw rides skyrocket! Think May-June or Sept-Oct are less crowded and kinder to your pocket. Also, prepone your booking for accommodation and travel by at least 2-3 months to snag some deals.", "normalised": "Okay, so you want to do the Char Dham Yatra but your wallet's looking thinner than a wafer biscuit?

{"unnormalised": "Next, ditch the fancy hotels and embrace the simplicity of ashrams or guesthouses. You'll find rooms for as little as Rs. 500 per night if you're lucky (and bargain hard!). Food is another big expense. Instead of eating at restaurants catering to tourists, look for local dhabas. Trust me, the dal-roti will be tastier and cost you only ₹50-₹80. Plus, pack your own snacks – chips, biscuits, dry fruits – to avoid those overpriced tourist traps. Hydration is key, so carry your own reusable water bottle. Buying bottled water at every stop will burn a hole in your pocket faster than a politician's promises.", "normalised": "Next, ditch the fancy hotels and embrace the simplicity of ashrams or guesthouses.

{"unnormalised": "Now, transportation. Forget hiring a private car, unless you're rolling with a big group splitting the cost. Opt for shared jeeps or buses. They're crowded, bumpy, and sometimes smell like yesterday's samosas, but hey, you're on a pilgrimage, right? Embrace the chaos! From Rishikesh to Yamunotri, it might cost ₹800-₹1200, depending on your bargaining skills. Plus, walk whenever possible! Not only is it free, but you'll also get some exercise and breathtaking views (and maybe even shed some of that extra chai weight).", "normalised": "Now, transportation.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember that the Char Dham Yatra isn't a race. Take your time, enjoy the journey, and don't feel pressured to spend all your money on unnecessary things. A simple darshan, a peaceful moment by the river, and a heartfelt prayer are worth more than any overpriced souvenir. Save your rupees for more important things, like buying your mom that saree she's been eyeing. Jai Baba Bholenath!", "normalised": "Finally, remember that the Char Dham Yatra isn't a race.
