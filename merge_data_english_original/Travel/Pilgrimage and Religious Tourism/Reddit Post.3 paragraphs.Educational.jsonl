{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, planning a pilgrimage trip and looking for some insights! I'm thinking of visiting either Vaishno Devi or the Golden Temple. Vaishno Devi's trek is 12 km uphill from Katra, which sounds tiring but rewarding. Golden Temple in Amritsar, on the other hand, is easily accessible. Any personal experiences or tips on deciding which one to visit 1st? What's the best time to go to avoid huge crowds? Heard Navratri is packed at Vaishno Devi, and Baisakhi at the Golden Temple.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, planning a pilgrimage trip and looking for some insights!
