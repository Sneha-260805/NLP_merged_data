{"unnormalised": "A friend of mine is planning a trip to India for spiritual reasons, and they asked me for recommendations. I've been to quite a few holy places in India over the yrs, so thought I'd share some ideas. For a truly powerful experience, you could visit Varanasi, also known as Kashi. It’s one of the oldest living cities in the world and is considered the spiritual capital of India. The ghats along the River Ganges are where you’ll find most of the action – sunrise boat rides, evening aartis, and of course, the burning ghats. It’s intense, but unforgettable. I’d suggest allocating at least 3-4 days there.", "normalised": "A friend of mine is planning a trip to India for spiritual reasons, and they asked me for recommendations.

The Sri Venkateswara Temple is one of the most visited religious sites in the world, and they receive about 50,000-100,000 pilgrims *daily*. You often have to book months in advance and queue for hours to get a glimpse of the deity. But people say the darshan is incredible. I remember when I went there way back in '05, it took us almost 12 hrs! If you're planning a trip, remember to check darshan timings on the TTD website & prepone travel dates accordingly.", "normalised": "Another option is Tirupati, in Andhra Pradesh.

The trek is challenging, usually taking 1-2 days, but the views are breathtaking, and the spiritual atmosphere is palpable. The best time to visit is from June to October. Don't forget warm clothing and good trekking shoes! Plus, registration opens around March 15th every year; book beforehand, or you might face disappointment.", "normalised": "Finally, if you want something a bit different, consider Hemkund Sahib.
