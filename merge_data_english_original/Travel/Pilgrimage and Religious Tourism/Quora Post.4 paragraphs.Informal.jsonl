{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about pilgrimage spots in India, so I thought I’d share some of my favs. Seriously, India’s got it all when it comes to spiritual travel. My grandmother, Dadi, goes every year to Vaishno Devi; she says you gotta go before you get too old, lol. It’s a trek, no joke, about 12 km uphill from Katra. She usually goes in Sept/Oct before it gets too cold. She also books her helicopter ride well in advance from Katra to Sanjichhat, as it reduces the walking distance.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about pilgrimage spots in India, so I thought I’d share some of my favorites.

Plus, it's supposed to be one of the oldest living cities in the world, dating back to the 11th century BCE. Just a heads up, watch out for the pandas (priests) trying to get you to donate like ₹5000 for some pooja. Bargain, bhai!", "normalised": "Then there's Varanasi.

The Dargah opens pretty early, around 4:00 AM, so get there early to avoid the crowds. Auto-rickshaws from the Ajmer railway station will charge you around Rs. 150-200, depending on your bargaining skills.", "normalised": "For something a little different, check out Ajmer Sharif Dargah.

Amma (mom) says they have miracle cures, and many people visit hoping for recovery from diseases. The main festival is on 8th September. Just a heads up, accommodation gets booked up months in advance, so plan ahead. Hope this helps!
