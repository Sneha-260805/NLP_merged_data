I planned the trip for twenty sixth October last year to twenty ninth October last year with my family. Booked the train tickets months in advance; Jammu Tawi Express. Reached Jammu around six A M on the twenty seventh. From there, took a pre-paid taxi (rupee eight hundred) to Katra. Trust me, prepone your bookings if you are travelling during peak season; it gets insanely crowded."}

The chopper ride cost us around rupees three thousand five hundred per person. After reaching Bhawan, had a quick darshan. The waiting time was roughly three hours, even with the priority pass. Remember to carry warm clothes, especially if you are travelling anytime around December to January; it gets chilly! Post darshan, we had some prasad and started our descent."}
