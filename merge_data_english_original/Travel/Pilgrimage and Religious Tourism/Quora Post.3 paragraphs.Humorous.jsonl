{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone’s asking about the best pilgrimage trips in India, eh? Listen, depends on what you’re looking for, bhai. Need to wash away some serious sins? Then head straight for Varanasi! Apparently, a dip in the Ganges there can erase, like, *all* your karmic baggage. Just try not to swallow too much of the river, okay? Heard it's got more than just blessings these days... And remember to haggle with the pandits, they quote some crazy prices, like Rs. 5000 for a simple pooja! Total loot, I tell you.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone's asking about the best pilgrimage trips in India, eh? Listen, depends on what you are looking for, brother.

Trek up those hills, chant \"Jai Mata Di!\" about a million times, and you're golden. Just prepare for the crowds, especially during Navratri. Seriously, it's like the whole of India decided to show up at once. BTW, ponies are available for Rs. 1200/- but walking is, you know, its own penance. Plus, all that climbing will burn off those extra samosas you sneak in.

{"unnormalised": "And for the truly adventurous, there’s always the Char Dham Yatra. Four temples, massive mountains, questionable roads… basically, a test of your faith and your bladder control. Pack warm clothes, carry a fully charged power bank, and maybe say a little prayer before you leave – especially if you are driving! You’ll need it. The Yatra usually starts around April-May and goes on till Oct-Nov, but always check the latest news before planning. Safe travels, and may your trip be less \"epic fail\" and more \"enlightened success\"! 😉", "normalised": "And for the truly adventurous, there is always the Char Dham Yatra.
