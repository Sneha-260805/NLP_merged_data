For Hindus, a trip to Varanasi (Kashi) is a classic – it's considered one of the holiest cities, situated on the banks of the Ganga. Don't forget to witness the Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat. Vaishno Devi in Jammu is another hugely popular destination, drawing millions of devotees every year.

You can also visit Sarnath near Varanasi, where he delivered his first sermon. Lumbini in Nepal, the Buddha's birthplace (just across the border, easily accessible) is worth the extra travel. For Sikhs, the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar is a must-see. The sheer beauty and serenity of the place are unparalleled. And remember to have langar; it's a communal meal that's free for everyone.", "normalised": "For Buddhists, Bodh Gaya in Bihar is the place to go.
