The weather was mostly pleasant, though got a bit chilly near Kedarnath.", "normalised": "Hey guys, so I just got back from my Char Dham Yatra, and it was seriously life-changing.

{"unnormalised": "The journey itself was quite something. We visited Yamunotri first, then Gangotri, then Kedarnath and finally Badrinath. The roads can be a bit rough in places, especially between Joshimath and Badrinath – our driver, Prakash ji, was amazing though. Each temple was unique – the darshan at Kedarnath was incredibly powerful, and the evening aarti at Badrinath was beautiful. Stayed in these dharamshalas mostly, decent enough for the price, around Rs. 800/night.", "normalised": "The journey itself was quite something.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, I'd highly recommend doing the Char Dham. Just be prepared for the altitude and the crowds. Also, carry warm clothes, even in May! Remember to keep your medical kit handy, because the weather can be unpredictable at that altitude and pre-pone your trip if you are facing breathing issues.", "normalised": "Overall, I'd highly recommend doing the Char Dham.
