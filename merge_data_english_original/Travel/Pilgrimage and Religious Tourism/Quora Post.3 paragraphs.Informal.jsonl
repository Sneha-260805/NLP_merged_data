I've heard a lot of people take the train to Jammu Tawi, but is that really the most convenient option? I'm travelling with my family, including my 70-year-old grandmother, so comfort is a priority. Also, any tips on booking the yatra registration online? Last time I checked, the website seemed a bit confusing, and I don’t want to rely on touts near the station.", "normalised": "So, I'm planning a trip to Vaishno Devi soon and was wondering what's the best way to get there.

Alternatively, you can also book a helicopter ride directly to Sanjichhat, which is closer to the Bhawan, but that can be quite expensive, around ₹2500-3000 per person. Just remember to book well in advance, especially during peak season like Navratri, because slots fill up fast.", "normalised": "From Jammu Tawi, you can take a pre-paid taxi or a bus to Katra, which is about fifty kilometer away.
