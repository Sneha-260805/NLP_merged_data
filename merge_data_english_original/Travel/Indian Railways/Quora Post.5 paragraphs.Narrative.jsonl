My co-passengers were a mix of families going home, students heading to college, and a couple of business travellers. One uncle, Mr. Sharma, was particularly helpful, showing me how to secure my luggage and telling me stories about his travels all over India. We crossed so many places like Patna, Mughal Sarai. The journey took almost 27 hrs.", "normalised": "Inside, it was a whole other world. My seat was thirty seven, side lower berth.

{"unnormalised": "The food was okay, not great, but definitely filling. They served lunch, dinner, and breakfast. I remember the bill being Rs. 150 for a veg thali. Also the vendors selling snacks, books and other items kept coming at regular intervals. The scenery outside was incredible - lush green fields, tiny villages, and rivers sparkling in the sunlight. I even managed to catch a glimpse of the sunset over the Ganges.", "normalised": "The food was okay, not great, but definitely filling. They served lunch, dinner, and breakfast.
