You get everything from the chai wallah yelling \"Chai, chai!\" to families unpacking enough food to feed an army. It's a beautiful, messy, occasionally frustrating, but always memorable adventure.", "normalised": "The Indian Railways, yaar, it's not just a mode of transport; it's a whole experience.

{"unnormalised": "Let's be real, booking a ticket can be a nightmare. Trying to snag a confirmed berth on the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani during Diwali? Good luck, my friend! You'll be refreshing the IRCTC website every 5 seconds, battling millions of other hopefuls. The tatkal system is like playing the lottery, and even if you do get through, you might end up paying Rs. 3000 for a ticket that usually costs Rs. 1500. But hey, that's part of the charm, right?", "normalised": "Let's be real, booking a ticket can be a nightmare. Trying to snag a confirmed berth on the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani during Diwali?

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the stations. Delhi Railway Station (NDLS), in particular, is a sight to behold. A constant flow of humanity, porters lugging massive suitcases on their heads, announcements blaring in Hindi and English, and the ever-present aroma of samosas and diesel fumes. You have to navigate through the crowds like a seasoned pro, dodging auto-rickshaws and stray dogs. The platforms are often overflowing, especially during peak hours, with trains arriving and departing every few minutes. Train no. 12001, the Bhopal Shatabdi, is notorious for its punctuality... or lack thereof.", "normalised": "And then there's the stations.

{"unnormalised": "The journey itself is a rollercoaster of emotions. You might find yourself crammed into a sleeper class compartment with 6 other people, sharing your snacks and stories. Or, if you're lucky, you might snag a seat in AC First Class and enjoy a relatively luxurious ride. But even in the fanciest compartment, you're bound to encounter some interesting characters. There's always that one uncle who snores like a freight train, the chatty auntie who knows everyone's life story, and the kids who are running up and down the aisle, playing tag.", "normalised": "The journey itself is a rollercoaster of emotions.

{"unnormalised": "Food is a major part of the Indian Railways experience. From the ubiquitous \"veg biryani\" and \"paneer masala\" served in foil containers to the crispy vada pavs sold at every station in Maharashtra, there's something to satisfy every craving. And let's not forget the chai. The chai wallahs are practically an institution on Indian Railways, serving up steaming cups of sweet, milky chai for just Rs. 10 a cup.", "normalised": "Food is a major part of the Indian Railways experience.

{"unnormalised": "Delays are inevitable. You might be stuck on a siding for hours, waiting for another train to pass. But even these delays can be an opportunity to experience the local culture. You can strike up a conversation with your fellow passengers, watch the countryside go by, or simply enjoy the peace and quiet. I remember one time, my train was delayed by 5 hrs near Agra. We all got off and ate delicious roadside Dhaba food.", "normalised": "Delays are inevitable. You might be stuck on a siding for hours, waiting for another train to pass.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the chaos and the occasional inconvenience, the Indian Railways holds a special place in the hearts of millions of Indians. It's a lifeline that connects people and places, a symbol of our shared history and culture. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's always beauty, connection, and a good story to be found. So next time you're planning a trip across India, ditch the plane and hop on a train. You might just have the adventure of a lifetime. You might get to meet someone special, experience something new, and see India in a way that you never thought possible. It's worth the Rs. 700 sleeper-class ticket, I promise.", "normalised": "Despite the chaos and the occasional inconvenience, the Indian Railways holds a special place in the hearts of millions of Indians.
