{"unnormalised": "First off, the IRCTC website is your friend, but also sometimes your foe, haha. It can be a pain to navigate, but it's the official place to book tickets. Try to book well in advance, especially if you’re traveling during peak season like Diwali or summer holidays. Trains like the Rajdhani and Shatabdi are usually pretty good, but they book up fast. I usually aim for at least 2 months beforehand.", "normalised": "First off, the I-R-C-T-C website is your friend, but also sometimes your foe, ha ha.

Sleeper class (SL) is the most basic and can get crowded, but it’s also the most budget-friendly. A sleeper ticket from Delhi to Mumbai will only cost you Rs. 600 or so.", "normalised": "Also, keep an eye out for different classes.

If you’re on the waiting list, there's a chance you won’t get a confirmed seat. Sometimes you get lucky and it gets confirmed last minute! You can check your PNR status on the IRCTC website or through various apps.
