{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about Indian Railways. It's an experience. A truly unique, only-in-India kind of experience. I mean, you haven't *really* lived until you've shared a compartment with a family of 20 and a goat, all while hurtling through the countryside at a speed that can only be described as \"leisurely.\" My latest trip, from Delhi to Kolkata (train no. 12301 if you *really* wanna know), was, shall we say, memorable.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about Indian Railways.

{"unnormalised": "First of all, booking a ticket is a Herculean task. Trying to snag a confirmed berth on the Rajdhani Express is like trying to win the lottery. Forget 1st AC; I was aiming for a measly 3AC! The IRCTC website, bless its glitchy heart, kept telling me 'WL 150'. WL 150?! I could walk faster. I finally got a ticket via some *jugaad* (don't ask). The relief was immense… until I saw my seat number.", "normalised": "First of all, booking a ticket is a Herculean task.

{"unnormalised": "My seat was smack-dab next to the loo. Oh, the aroma! It was a delicate blend of disinfectant, spices from the pantry car, and… well, let's just say \"life.\" The guy across from me, bless his soul, spent the entire journey clipping his toenails. Sound effects included. Entertainment provided free of charge, folks! The train was delayed by 4 hours. 4 HOURS! I could have walked to Agra in that time!", "normalised": "My seat was smack-dab next to the loo. Oh, the aroma!

{"unnormalised": "And the food? Oh, the food! I ordered the \"Veg Thali.\" It arrived looking like a Jackson Pollock painting – rice, dal, and something vaguely green all swirled together. I think I saw a fly doing the backstroke in the dal. I stuck to biscuits after that. Good old Parle-G, never fails. The chai, however, was surprisingly decent. Rs. 10 well spent.", "normalised": "And the food? Oh, the food!

{"unnormalised": "The vendors were another story. \"Chai garam! Vada pav! Magazines! Blankets! Astrology!\" They were relentless. It was like being bombarded with entrepreneurial spirit. I swear, one guy even tried to sell me a timeshare. On a train. Going 60 kmph. And the guy sitting across from me kept staring, offering unsolicited life advice.

The camaraderie, the constant buzz of conversation, the views of the countryside whizzing by… It's an experience you won't find anywhere else.
