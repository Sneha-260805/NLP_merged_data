{"unnormalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways! A saga in steel, a ballet of baggage, and a comedy in compartments. For the uninitiated, boarding an Indian train is akin to entering a parallel universe where time moves at its own (glacial) pace and personal space is a myth perpetuated by Hollywood. If you're planning a rail adventure across Bharat, brace yourself and remember: laughter is the best chai!", "normalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways!

{"unnormalised": "First, the booking. Attempting to secure a ticket on IRCTC is a test of patience, internet speed, and karmic balance. You’re battling millions of other Indians, all equally desperate to reach their destinations. Be prepared for server crashes, CAPTCHA challenges that would stump Einstein, and the sinking realization that your 'waitlisted' ticket has a better chance of winning the lottery than confirming. Pro tip: Book well in advance. Like, maybe for Diwali 2025, if you're travelling during peak season.", "normalised": "First, the booking.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the station experience. Imagine a mela, a cattle market, and a rock concert all rolled into one chaotic symphony. Navigating the platform is an art. Dodge rogue trolleys laden with enough luggage to rival a small cargo ship, sidestep families picnicking on the floor, and ignore the persistent calls of \"chai, garam chai!\" Remember, the only constant is change, and that includes platform numbers announced 5 minutes before departure.", "normalised": "Then comes the station experience.

{"unnormalised": "The train itself is a microcosm of India. Inside, you’ll find a cross-section of society: students cramming for exams, families embarking on pilgrimages, and business folk glued to their phones. Be prepared to share your space – and your snacks. Uncle Sharma WILL offer you a samosa, even if you've just devoured a whole plate of pani puri. Politely decline at your own peril.", "normalised": "The train itself is a microcosm of India.

{"unnormalised": "The food situation is another source of amusement. Railway catering is a culinary adventure. The “veg biryani” might contain mysterious vegetables you've never seen before, and the \"cutlet\" might resemble a fossilized hockey puck. Embrace the uncertainty, or pack your own parathas. Vendor calls are a part of the experience though, and \"aloo tikki... garam garam!\" is always something to smile about.", "normalised": "The food situation is another source of amusement.

Let's just say they’re an experience best described as \"character-building.\" Pack hand sanitizer, wet wipes, and a healthy dose of stoicism. And maybe a nose clip, just in case.
