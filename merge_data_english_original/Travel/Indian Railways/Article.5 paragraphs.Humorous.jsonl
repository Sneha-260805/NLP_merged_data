{"unnormalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways! A microcosm of India itself – chaotic, colourful, and utterly unforgettable. Forget those sterile, sanitized train journeys you see in European films; here, we're talking about a full-sensory experience that'll leave you with stories to tell for yrs. Planning a trip? Brace yourself, my friend. It's not just about booking a ticket on IRCTC, it's about preparing for an adventure of epic proportions. My first experience was on the GT express, i booked it for 26/01/2010, what a trip.", "normalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways!

{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the booking process. Securing a confirmed ticket is an art form, a delicate dance between luck, persistence, and maybe a little bit of divine intervention. Tatkal bookings open at 10:00 AM, and if you blink, poof! Gone. Forget about sleeping in; setting your alarm for 9:55 AM is practically a religious ritual. And don't even get me started on the \"waiting list.\" WL 123? You've got a better chance of winning the lottery. Remember to keep your PNR number handy and pray to your preferred deity.", "normalised": "Let's start with the booking process.

{"unnormalised": "Once you're finally onboard, prepare for a symphony of sounds. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels, the chai wallah's bellowing cry of \"Chai garam!\", the uncle snoring like a chainsaw – it's all part of the charm. Personal space? What's that? You'll be intimately acquainted with your fellow passengers, whether you like it or not. Sharing snacks is practically mandatory, so pack extra samosas and be prepared to swap stories. One time, i gave away 1kg of sweets that my grandmother had prepared.", "normalised": "Once you're finally onboard, prepare for a symphony of sounds.

{"unnormalised": "And the food! Oh, the railway food. From the mystery-meat cutlets to the suspiciously orange biryani, it's an adventure for your taste buds (and possibly your digestive system). Pro tip: pack your own snacks. A massive bag of chips and a thermos of chai will make you the most popular person in your compartment. Alternatively, risk the train thali and gamble with the possibility of Delhi belly. Your choice! The prices vary, and the food available in the station costs Rs 50 on average.", "normalised": "And the food! Oh, the railway food.

It's a journey through the heart of India, a chance to witness the country's incredible diversity and resilience. So, pack your bags, grab your sense of humor, and hop on board. Just be prepared for anything. You might even end up with a story funnier than this one to tell. You know that the train 12345 is expected to arrive at the station at 4:30 PM.
