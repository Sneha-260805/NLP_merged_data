It's like a rite of passage for any desi traveller. The whole process, from booking tickets on IRCTC to navigating crowded platforms, can seem a bit daunting at first.

{"unnormalised": "One of the first hurdles is figuring out the ticket booking system. You’ll likely be using the IRCTC website or app, which, let's be honest, can be a tad slow sometimes. Booking opens at 10:00 AM sharp for AC classes and 11:00 AM for sleeper class tickets, so be ready with your details. Make sure you have your Aadhaar linked too, it sometimes makes things easier. Keep an eye out for different train types like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, and Duronto - they offer varying levels of comfort and speed. And definitely check the PNR status after booking; knowing if you're RAC or confirmed is crucial.", "normalised": "One of the first hurdles is figuring out the ticket booking system.

Remember to pack some snacks and water, though you can usually find vendors selling food and drinks on the train. Also, download some movies or shows beforehand, as the internet connectivity can be patchy in many areas. Power banks are a lifesaver too; you don’t want your phone dying halfway through a 24-hour journey. I usually try to book 3A or 2A class; it makes the long journey a bit more bearable.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the journey itself.
