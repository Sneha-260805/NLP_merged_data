{"unnormalised": "Let me tell you, the sheer organized chaos of a major Indian railway station is something else. Families camped out on platforms, announcements blaring every 5 minutes, coolies lugging around mountains of luggage. Found my coach (A2, berth 47) eventually, and settled in. The train left pretty much on time, give or take 10 mins. My co-passengers were a mix of business travellers and families heading home.", "normalised": "Let me tell you, the sheer organized chaos of a major Indian railway station is something else.

{"unnormalised": "Mumbai was just a stopover. I only had a 6-hour layover before boarding the Konkan Kanya Express to Goa. This train was a completely different vibe – more relaxed, less crowded. Plus, the scenery! The Konkan coast is absolutely stunning. Reached Madgaon at 07:00 AM the next day. Spent a few days chilling on the beaches, soaking up the sun. Highly recommend Palolem beach, btw.", "normalised": "Mumbai was just a stopover. I only had a six hour layover before boarding the Konkan Kanya Express to Goa.

{"unnormalised": "The entire trip, covering roughly 2500 kms, cost me around ₹8000 for train tickets. And honestly, it was worth every penny. Seeing India through the window of a train is an experience like no other. I'd say plan your trip during off season months like Sept or Oct for less crowd, Also, book tickets well in advance via IRCTC to avoid last minute hassle! Definitely doing this again!", "normalised": "The entire trip, covering roughly two thousand five hundred kilometers, cost me around rupee eight thousand for train tickets.
