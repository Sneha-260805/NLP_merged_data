Booked a ticket on the Rajdhani Express from Delhi to Mumbai, train no. 12952. The booking process itself was a bit of a hassle, had to navigate the IRCTC website which, let's just say, could use some serious UX improvements. Managed to snag a 3AC berth eventually, though.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit, just wanted to share my recent train travel experience in India – it was quite the adventure!

Made some interesting acquaintances along the way. Met a businessman traveling for work and a family going to Mumbai for Diwali. Lots of interesting stories exchanged.
