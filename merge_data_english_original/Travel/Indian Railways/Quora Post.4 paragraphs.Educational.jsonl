{"unnormalised": "What are some important things to know before travelling on Indian Railways?", "normalised": "Travelling on Indian Railways can be an incredible experience, offering a glimpse into the diverse landscapes and cultures of India. However, it's good to be prepared. First, booking is essential, especially during peak seasons like Diwali or summer vacations. Try booking your ticket well in advance through I-R-C-T-C's website, i-r-c-t-c dot c-o dot i-n. Tatkal tickets are an option for last-minute travel, but they sell out quickly. Keep your P-N-R number handy for checking your reservation status."}

A-C First Class (one A) offers the most comfort and privacy, while A-C two-Tier (two A) and A-C three-Tier (three A) are more affordable options. Sleeper class is the most common and budget-friendly, but it can get crowded. Before boarding, locate your coach and seat number based on the chart usually pasted near the platform entrance.

You can pre-order meals through I-R-C-T-C or buy from vendors on the train. Be cautious about the quality and hygiene of food from unverified sources. Carrying your own water bottle is advisable, and you can refill it at designated water points.

Trains are often delayed by several hours due to weather conditions or track maintenance. Check the train's live status using apps like RailYatri or N-T-E-S (National Train Enquiry System). It’s always good to have a buffer time in your itinerary. If your train is delayed by more than three hours, you might be eligible for a refund, so keep your ticket safe."}
