{"unnormalised": "The modernization drive is particularly focused on high-density corridors and routes prone to congestion. Northern Railway zone, which includes busy sections like Delhi-Kanpur, will receive a substantial portion of the investment. The installation of ATP systems, based on the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2 standards, will automatically prevent trains from exceeding speed limits or passing signals at danger, thus mitigating human error.", "normalised": "The modernization drive is particularly focused on high-density corridors and routes prone to congestion.
