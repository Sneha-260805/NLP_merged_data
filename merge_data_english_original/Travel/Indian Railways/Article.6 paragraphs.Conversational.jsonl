IRCTC is your go-to website or app. You’ll see trains like the “12002 Bhopal Shatabdi Express” or the “12863 Howrah Yesvantpur Express”. Notice the 5-digit number? That’s the train number, and it’s how you’ll identify your train on the platform screens. Booking windows usually open 120 days in advance, so plan ahead.
