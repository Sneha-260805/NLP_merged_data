You'll see everything – families sharing meals, chai wallahs hustling, and stunning landscapes whizzing by your window. Plus, you can snag a ticket for surprisingly cheap. I mean, a sleeper class ticket from Delhi to Mumbai can be as low as Rs. 800 if you book in advance. Try finding a flight for that price!", "normalised": "So, you’re probably thinking, “Trains?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk specifics. There are tons of train options, from the super-fast Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express trains (think: slightly fancier and more expensive) to the more budget-friendly and slower passenger trains. Rajdhani might cost you around Rs. 3500 for the same Delhi to Mumbai route, but you get meals included and a faster travel time, around 16 hrs. The Passenger train could take almost 2 days!
