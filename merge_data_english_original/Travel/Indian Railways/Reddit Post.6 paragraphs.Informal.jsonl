{"unnormalised": "So, here's the deal. I'm trying to book a ticket from Mumbai to Patna for around the 25th of Oct, give or take a day or two. Preferably in 3A, you know, gotta travel with some semblance of comfort! I've checked IRCTC, and the waiting list is insane – like WL 150 on most trains. Is tatkal my only option? I've heard horror stories about tatkal too.", "normalised": "So, here is the deal. I am trying to book a ticket from Mumbai to Patna for around the twenty fifth of October, give or take a day or two.

{"unnormalised": "I was looking at the Rajdhani Express, train no. 12309, but even that's showing a massive waiting list. Someone told me to try booking from a smaller station a few stops before Mumbai CST. Does that actually work? Or is it just an urban legend? Also, any tips on scoring a confirmed ticket during the festive season? I'm seriously considering just giving up and flying, even though it costs like Rs. 8000 more.", "normalised": "I was looking at the Rajdhani Express, train number one two three zero nine, but even that is showing a massive waiting list.

{"unnormalised": "Anyone know if there are any special trains running around Diwali time? I saw something about it on NTES, but the details were kinda vague.

{"unnormalised": "Also, quick question for those who travel this route often – which train is generally more punctual? I need to reach Patna by the morning of the 27th latest. Punctuality is key because my cousin's wedding is that day. I'm seeing mixed reviews online.
