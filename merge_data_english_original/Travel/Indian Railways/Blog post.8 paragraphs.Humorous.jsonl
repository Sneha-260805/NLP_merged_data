{"unnormalised": "Right, so I'm just back from what can only be described as a \"character-building\" experience – a 24 hr train journey from Delhi to Guwahati on the Rajdhani Express (supposedly one of the *good* ones!). I mean, the scenery was lovely, when I could actually *see* it through the grime on the window. Let's just say it's an experience you won't find in any 5 star hotel. More like a zero-star, if we're being honest, lol.", "normalised": "Chai, Chaos, and Chugging Along: My Love-Hate Relationship with Indian Railways"}
{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the \"scheduled\" departure time of 14:00 hrs was more of a suggestion, really. We finally chugged out of New Delhi station at around 2:45 PM. Gotta love Indian Stretchable Time! The good news is the pantry car guy arrived promptly with chai. Rs 10 well spent.", "normalised": "Right, so I am just back from what can only be described as a character-building experience – a twenty four hour train journey from Delhi to Guwahati on the Rajdhani Express (supposedly one of the good ones!).

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the food. Oh, the food! I swear, they deep-fry *everything*. Even the *air* probably gets a quick dunk in the fryer before being served. I packed 3 parathas (thanks, Mom!) which turned out to be my lifeline. The \"veg biryani\" served for dinner at 8:30 PM looked suspiciously like something recycled from lunch.", "normalised": "Firstly, the scheduled departure time of fourteen hundred hours was more of a suggestion, really.

{"unnormalised": "And the people! Where do I even begin? There was the auntie who brought enough luggage for a small wedding (seriously, 6 suitcases?!), the guy playing loud Bollywood songs on his phone at 6 AM (because, you know, everyone wants to wake up to \"Munni Badnaam Hui\"), and the family of 12 who somehow managed to fit into a compartment designed for 6. It's like a Tetris game, but with humans and questionable personal hygiene.", "normalised": "Then there is the food. Oh, the food! I swear, they deep-fry everything.

{"unnormalised": "But amidst the chaos, there's also a certain charm. The shared stories, the spontaneous singing sessions, the chai breaks at every station... it's a microcosm of India itself. At one stop, a kid was selling \"garam samosas\" for just ₹5 each. Total bargain!", "normalised": "And the people! Where do I even begin?

{"unnormalised": "My co-passenger, Mr. Sharma, a retired engineer, kept complaining about everything but then, he somehow looked like he was enjoying all of it deep down.

{"unnormalised": "Because, honestly, a journey on the Indian Railways is less a mode of transport and more a rite of passage. It’s a beautiful, chaotic, smelly, wonderful, frustrating, unforgettable experience. Just remember to check your PNR status regularly and maybe, just maybe, you'll arrive at your destination sometime before the next Ice Age. It’s the only way to travel... if you like living on the edge! 😉", "normalised": "So, would I do it again? Maybe. Probably.
