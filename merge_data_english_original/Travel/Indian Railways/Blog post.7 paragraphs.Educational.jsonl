Bookings open 120 days in advance, and popular routes, especially during peak season like Diwali or summer holidays, fill up quickly. Consider booking in advance, particularly if you're travelling on popular trains like the Rajdhani or Shatabdi Express. Tatkal tickets are available for last-minute travel, but come at a premium and are subject to availability. Agents also exist, but stick to authorized ones to avoid scams.", "normalised": "First things first: ticket bookings.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding train types is crucial. The aforementioned Rajdhani and Shatabdi are premium, fully air-conditioned trains connecting major cities. Then there are the Duronto Express trains, also connecting major cities with fewer stops, known for speed. Mail/Express trains are more common, stopping at more stations and offering a mix of AC and non-AC classes. Passenger trains are the slowest, stopping at almost every station. For long journeys, consider trains with sleeper classes (SL) for cost-effectiveness. Look for train numbers like 12301 or 12841 to identify specific trains.", "normalised": "Understanding train types is crucial.

You can also order food online through various platforms. However, many travelers prefer to buy food from stations along the route, offering local delicacies.

A chai from a platform vendor is practically a rite of passage!", "normalised": "Food is an integral part of the Indian Railways experience.
