It was 2005, and I was barely 6, clutching my mother's saree as we navigated the bustling platforms of Delhi Jn. The air thrummed with announcements, the rhythmic clatter of luggage wheels, and the tantalizing aroma of samosas frying at a nearby stall. Our destination? Varanasi, a spiritual journey we were undertaking during the auspicious month of Kartik. I remember being awestruck by the sheer size of the train, the \"Shiv Ganga Express\", a metal behemoth stretching seemingly into infinity.", "normalised": "My first memory of Indian Railways is etched in my mind like a perfectly brewed cup of chai – comforting, chaotic, and utterly unforgettable.

We squeezed past families picnicking on the floor, vendors hawking everything from plastic toys to religious trinkets, and a veritable obstacle course of luggage.

An elderly gentleman regaled us with stories of his travels, highlighting the best places to eat along the route. A family shared their homemade laddoos, sweetening our already memorable experience.
