It's not just a mode of transport; it's a microcosm of India itself. The sheer variety of people you meet, the sounds, the smells – it's an assault on the senses in the best possible way."}

I booked a three A C ticket well in advance. It was during Durga Puja, and the train was packed! I arrived at New Delhi Railway Station at six P M, a bit early to find my berth. The platform was already teeming with people, chai wallahs yelling, and the general chaos that you expect at any major Indian railway station. I managed to find my compartment, and surprisingly, it wasn't too difficult to stow my luggage."}

I was sharing my compartment with a family of four from Kolkata, going back home for the puja holidays. They were incredibly friendly and offered me homemade snacks – singara and rosogolla. We chatted for hours about everything from Bollywood movies to the rising prices of dal."}

Not exactly gourmet cuisine, but filling and satisfying. After dinner, I tried to get some sleep, but the constant rattling of the train and the snoring of my fellow passengers made it a bit challenging. I did manage to doze off for a few hours."}

It's about the experiences you have along the way. It's about the chai you share with strangers, the stories you hear, and the memories you make. Sure, there are delays, the toilets might not always be spotless, and the food can be hit or miss, but that's all part of the charm. I highly recommend everyone to try it at least once. Even the unreserved sitting is amazing."}
