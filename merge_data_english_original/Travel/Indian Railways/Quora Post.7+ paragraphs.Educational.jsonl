{"unnormalised": "**Question: What are some things you should know before traveling on Indian Railways?**", "normalised": "First off, booking tickets. I-R-C-T-C’s website or app is your go-to. Tatkal bookings open one day prior to the journey (excluding the date of travel). So, if you’re traveling on twenty sixth October two thousand and twenty four, Tatkal opens on twenty fifth October two thousand and twenty four. A-C classes open at ten A-M, and sleeper class at eleven A-M. Be quick; seats vanish fast! Also, keep your P-N-R number handy (it's a ten digit number usually). This will help you track the status of your ticket. You can check your P-N-R status on the I-R-C-T-C website or through various third-party apps. Many trains operate at full capacity and the possibility of R-A-C (Reservation Against Cancellation) tickets is pretty high. Be aware of this before planning your journey."}
