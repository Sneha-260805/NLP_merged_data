{"unnormalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways. A glorious, sprawling, often baffling institution that moves millions daily, mostly on time-ish. Forget luxury cruises, my friends; a train journey in India is the ultimate adventure, a rollercoaster of emotions ranging from existential dread to mild euphoria when you actually reach your destination. And let's not even start on the food. I swear, that \"vegetable biryani\" I had on the Howrah Mail tasted suspiciously like yesterday's newsprint mixed with turmeric. Cost me ₹150 too!", "normalised": "Ah, the Indian Railways. A glorious, sprawling, often baffling institution that moves millions daily, mostly on time-ish.

{"unnormalised": "First, booking a ticket. The IRCTC website, a technological marvel from the early 2000s, is where the fun begins. You'll battle hordes of eager travellers all vying for a precious seat. Tatkal booking? May God have mercy on your soul. Be prepared to refresh that page more times than you've said \"Namaste\" in your life. I once spent 3 hours trying to book a ticket from Delhi to Mumbai, only to end up taking a bus. The bus AC conked out halfway through, but hey, at least I had a guaranteed seat!", "normalised": "First, booking a ticket.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the waiting game at the station. Platform 42b? Seems legit. Your train, the \"Superfast Express,\" is running \"slightly late.\" Slightly late in Indian Railways parlance could mean anything from 1 hr to, well, who knows? Embrace the chaos, grab a chai for Rs. 10, and settle in for the long haul. Don't forget to eavesdrop on the conversations around you – you'll hear stories that would make even Bollywood scriptwriters blush.", "normalised": "Then there's the waiting game at the station.

{"unnormalised": "Once onboard, the real entertainment begins. Your fellow passengers, a motley crew of uncles, aunties, students, and the occasional wandering sadhu, are your family for the next few hours (or days!). Be prepared for unsolicited advice, loud phone conversations, and a generous sharing of snacks. Aunty Sharma's homemade pickles are legendary... and potentially lethal.

{"unnormalised": "But amidst the delays, the questionable food, and the sheer madness, there's a certain charm to the Indian Railways. It's a microcosm of India itself – diverse, chaotic, and utterly unforgettable. The view from the window, as the train chugs through lush green fields and bustling villages, is worth all the hassle.

And remember, the journey is the destination, especially when the destination is still 10 hours away and you're stuck in a middle berth with Uncle Sharma snoring in your ear.
