{"unnormalised": "Indian Railways, the lifeline of India, eh? Gotta love the chaos and the charm! Planning a trip? Here's the lowdown. First off, book those tickets EARLY, like months in advance if you're traveling during Diwali or Holi. IRCTC's website is your best friend (or worst enemy, depending on your luck). Remember Tatkal bookings open at 10:00 AM for AC classes and 11:00 AM for non-AC. Set those alarms, folks!", "normalised": "Indian Railways, the lifeline of India, eh?

{"unnormalised": "Now, class matters. 3AC is generally a good balance between comfort and cost. 2AC gives you more space, and 1AC is practically a hotel room (well, almost!). Sleeper class is the real Indian experience, though. Get ready to share space, stories, and maybe even some snacks with your co-passengers.
