{"unnormalised": "I've been eyeing a few options, like the Cordelia Cruises to Goa. Seems pretty tempting, but honestly, the price tags are making my wallet weep a little. Is it *really* worth ₹25,000+ for a 3-night trip? Also, what's the scene like? Is it mostly families, honeymooners, or a mix? I’m travelling solo, so hoping it won't be too couples-centric.", "normalised": "I've been eyeing a few options, like the Cordelia Cruises to Goa.

{"unnormalised": "I've also heard whispers of cruises from Mumbai to Lakshadweep. Sounds idyllic, but info is kinda scarce. Anyone done this route? What are the ports like? I'm guessing it's a smaller ship, so is it prone to getting rocky? I get seasick fairly easily, unfortunately. Dramamine is my best friend, but still, gotta factor it in. Plus, accessibility is key for me. I need to make sure that the ship that I'm going on is wheelchair accessible and ready to make the proper accommodations for me.", "normalised": "I've also heard whispers of cruises from Mumbai to Lakshadweep.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the option of ferries. Okay, not exactly a cruise, but could still be a cool way to see the coastline, right? I’m thinking maybe taking a ferry from Chennai to Port Blair (Andaman & Nicobar). It's a long haul – like 60+ hrs, yikes! – but supposed to be quite scenic. Has anyone done this? What's the ferry like? I hear it can be a bit… basic. Also, is there a VIP section or something where you can get a decent cabin? I would be willing to spend an extra ₹15000 for a nicer cabin.", "normalised": "Then there's the option of ferries.

{"unnormalised": "On a side note, I was reading about these luxury river cruises on the Brahmaputra in Assam. Seems super fancy, but also probably costs a bomb. Has anyone tried one of those? It is something that I would love to do, even if it is just for a few days. What's the general price point for a trip like that? I saw a few packages advertised at $500 but I'm not sure how reliable that is.", "normalised": "On a side note, I was reading about these luxury river cruises on the Brahmaputra in Assam.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, any tips on avoiding tourist traps? I want an authentic experience, not some overly-packaged \"Incredible India\" thing. Also, safety tips for a solo female traveller on these routes would be greatly appreciated! Any insights on travel insurance that covers these types of trips in India? I'm specifically looking at policies that cover medical emergencies and trip cancellations. Would really appreciate any advice. I will be sure to pay it forward one day. Thanks everyone in advance for any information that can be given to me. This is my first time travelling solo, so I'm very nervous.", "normalised": "Finally, any tips on avoiding tourist traps?
