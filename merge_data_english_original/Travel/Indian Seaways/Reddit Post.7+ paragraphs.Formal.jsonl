{"unnormalised": "First, coastal passenger ferry services. I am particularly interested in services along the Konkan coast. While I know that certain operators run services between Mumbai, Goa, and Mangalore, details on frequency and reliability seem scarce. Specifically, has anyone recently travelled this route, and can share their experiences with the \"Mumbai Goa Ferry\"? I saw an article claiming fares start at Rs. 3500, but I’d like to confirm if this information is current.", "normalised": "First, coastal passenger ferry services.

{"unnormalised": "Next, I'm curious about the operational status of the Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off) ferry services, especially those intended to alleviate road congestion. I remember reading about services linking Ghogha and Dahej in Gujarat. Are they still running effectively? Are there plans to expand such services to other coastal regions, such as between Kochi and Alappuzha in Kerala, where road traffic is often a nightmare? Official reports suggest potential environmental impact assessments being carried out, but I haven’t seen much concrete development.", "normalised": "Next, I'm curious about the operational status of the R-o-R-o (Roll-on/Roll-off) ferry services, especially those intended to alleviate road congestion.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the mainland, I’m keen to learn more about inter-island connectivity in places like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep. What are the typical travel times between Port Blair and Havelock Island, and what types of vessels are usually deployed on this route? I've come across tourist packages that quote prices of Rs. 8000 for a three-day trip, but I'm unsure if these are reputable operators. Further, how frequently do mainland-to-island passenger ships operate?", "normalised": "Beyond the mainland, I’m keen to learn more about inter-island connectivity in places like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, I'm researching cargo movement along India's coastline. The Sagarmala project aims to boost coastal shipping for cargo, but I'm struggling to find reliable data on the volume of cargo currently being transported by sea versus by road or rail. Official ministry data suggests a target of increasing coastal cargo movement to 20% by 2025, but I'm curious if this goal is on track. Is there evidence of reduced transportation costs and transit times for specific commodities?", "normalised": "Furthermore, I'm researching cargo movement along India's coastline.
