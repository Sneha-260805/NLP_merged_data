{"unnormalised": "Last year, during my trip to Kerala, I decided to take the ferry from Kochi to Alleppey. The ticket cost me around Rs. 300. The journey started at 10:00 AM from the main jetty. The views were absolutely stunning, especially passing through the backwaters. It took roughly 3 hrs to reach Alleppey. Next time, I'm planning a longer cruise along the Konkan coast, maybe from Mumbai to Goa, supposedly takes about 24 hrs, though I heard tickets can cost upwards of ₹5000! Heard the sunsets are amazing from the sea.", "normalised": "Last year, during my trip to Kerala, I decided to take the ferry from Kochi to Alleppey. The ticket cost me around rupee three hundred.
