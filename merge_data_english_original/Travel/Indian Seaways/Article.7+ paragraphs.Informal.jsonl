{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Ever thought about ditching the usual flight or train for your next vacay? Seriously, consider hitting the Indian seaways! I’m talking about cruises, ferries, and even those smaller passenger ships that connect our coastal cities. It's a totally different vibe, and honestly, pretty underrated. We usually think of Goa's beaches or Kerala's backwaters, but what about experiencing them from the sea?", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Forget the crowded airports and delayed trains. Imagine sipping chai on the deck as you sail past the Konkan coast at sunset. Picture this: Starting from Mumbai, taking a 3-day cruise to Goa. The entire experience is different. I personally prefer it over the hustle bustle of land travel during peak seasons like Diwali. The prices can vary but expect to shell out around Rs. 15000 - Rs. 30000 for a decent cabin.", "normalised": "Forget the crowded airports and delayed trains.

{"unnormalised": "There are some fantastic routes that many people don't even know about. For example, you can take a ferry from Mumbai to Mandwa (Alibaug). It's a super convenient way to reach Alibaug, bypassing the road traffic. The ferry tickets typically cost around Rs. 300-500, and the journey takes about an hour. From there, it’s a short auto-rickshaw ride to your final destination.", "normalised": "There are some fantastic routes that many people don't even know about.

{"unnormalised": "The Kochi to Lakshadweep route is another gem. While it might take a bit longer (14-20 hrs approx.), the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. It’s operated by Lakshadweep Administration and the schedule is often irregular, so check well in advance (like 2 weeks before) with them. I've heard that tickets start from Rs. 2500 for the basic class. Pack some seasickness meds just in case!", "normalised": "The Kochi to Lakshadweep route is another gem.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on the potential for island hopping! Think Andaman and Nicobar Islands. You can catch ships from Chennai, Kolkata, or Visakhapatnam to Port Blair. The voyage usually lasts 2-3 days, but hey, think of it as a mini-adventure on the high seas! Bookings for these trips are usually done through the Directorate of Shipping Services, and trust me, it requires patience (and a lot of paperwork!). Cost will be around Rs 5000 - Rs 10000, but it's worth it.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on the potential for island hopping! Think Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
