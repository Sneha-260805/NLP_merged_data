{"unnormalised": "New ferry service connects Mumbai & Mandwa! Finally, a quicker way to reach Alibaug. Saw this on Insta – apparently, the new catamaran ferries are way faster than the old ones. Costs around Rs. 500-750, depending on the class you choose. Leaves from Gateway of India at 9:00 AM and reaches Mandwa in just over an hour. Beats the heck outta the 3-4 hr road trip!", "normalised": "New ferry service connects Mumbai and Mandwa! Finally, a quicker way to reach Alibaug.

{"unnormalised": "Heard from my cousin, Priya, who used it last weekend. She said the views are amazing, especially during sunset. Much better than being stuck in traffic near Panvel. She did mention that the return ferries get crowded around 6:00-7:00 PM, so booking in advance is a good idea. Also, apparently, you can take your bike for an extra ₹200.", "normalised": "Heard from my cousin, Priya, who used it last weekend. She said the views are amazing, especially during sunset.

{"unnormalised": "Def gonna try this next time I'm planning a weekend getaway to Alibaug. Seems like a real game-changer for travel between Mumbai & the coastal areas. They’re even talking about adding more routes soon, like maybe one to Dighi or Murud-Janjira. Keep an eye out on the MMB website for updates.", "normalised": "Definitely going to try this next time I am planning a weekend getaway to Alibaug.
