{"unnormalised": "Hey Redditors, planning a trip and seriously considering exploring India's coastline. I'm particularly intrigued by ferry services; they seem like a cool alternative to flights or trains. Has anyone taken the Mumbai to Goa ferry? The online listings show pricing at ₹3500 - ₹7000 depending on the class. I want to get some firsthand accounts before booking. Is it worth the cost and time (approx. 14 hrs according to the website)? Any tips on booking or things to watch out for?", "normalised": "Hey R-E-D-D-I-T-O-R-S, planning a trip and seriously considering exploring India's coastline.

{"unnormalised": "I'm also looking at routes in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The inter-island ferries are essential for getting around, but info seems a bit scattered. I've seen prices fluctuating wildly, reported delays, and varying levels of comfort. The Directorate of Shipping Services (DSS) schedule is often cited, but availability seems uncertain. Has anyone had experience navigating the DSS ferries in 2023/2024? Were pre-bookings essential? Did you use a travel agent, or handle it independently?", "normalised": "I am also looking at routes in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, I'm also curious about the Ro-Ro ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej in Gujarat. I understand it dramatically cuts travel time. The schedule I found indicates departures at 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Is this still accurate? Also, what's the best way to book tickets for the Ro-Ro, and what are the current Ro-Ro Ferry Ghogha-Dahej ticket price 2024?
