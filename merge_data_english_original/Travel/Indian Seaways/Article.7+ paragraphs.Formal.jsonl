{"unnormalised": "One of the key advantages of utilising seaways is their economic viability. Waterways offer a significantly cheaper mode of transportation compared to road and rail, especially for bulk cargo. The cost per ton-kilometer is considerably lower, making it an attractive option for industries involved in the movement of raw materials, minerals, and agricultural products. This cost-effectiveness translates into reduced logistics expenses and increased competitiveness for Indian businesses, particularly those located in proximity to navigable waterways.", "normalised": "One of the key advantages of utilizing seaways is their economic viability.

Vessels consume less fuel per ton-kilometer compared to trucks, resulting in lower carbon emissions and reduced air pollution. This aligns with India's commitment to sustainable development and its efforts to combat climate change. Shifting a portion of freight traffic from roads to waterways can significantly contribute to a greener transportation sector and improved air quality in urban areas.", "normalised": "Furthermore, seaways are inherently more environmentally friendly than road transport.

The National Waterway 1 (NW-1), also known as the Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system, extends from Haldia to Allahabad, covering a distance of 1,620 km. This waterway offers connectivity to major industrial and agricultural centers in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Similarly, the Brahmaputra River (NW-2) and the West Coast Canal (NW-3) are being developed to enhance connectivity in the northeastern and southern regions of India respectively.
