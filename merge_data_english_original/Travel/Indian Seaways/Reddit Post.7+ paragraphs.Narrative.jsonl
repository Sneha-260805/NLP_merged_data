{"unnormalised": "The ship, \"MV Kavaratti,\" was surprisingly decent. Think of it as a floating hotel – albeit a slightly older one.

We were tendered ashore (small boats taking us from the ship to the island), and the water was crystal clear. Snorkeling was on the agenda, and I managed to spot a sea turtle – a real highlight. Lunch was served on the beach, simple but delicious – grilled fish, rice, and some local veggies.

Just remember to prepone your return plans in case there's a delay like there usually is, and bargain hard in the markets. You could save upto 10-15%. And don't forget the sunscreen! SPF 50 at least.", "normalised": "The journey back was uneventful, mostly spent relaxing on deck, reading a book, and enjoying the sunset.
