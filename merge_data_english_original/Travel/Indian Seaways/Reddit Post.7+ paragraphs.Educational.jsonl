{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk ferries. Think of places like Mumbai to Goa. You can catch a ferry for around Rs. 3000 (₹3000) depending on the class. It's a longer journey than flying, obviously, maybe 12 hrs, but the views are incredible, especially during sunset. There are different ferry operators, so check online booking portals for the best deals. Make sure to book in advance, esp. during peak season (like Diwali holidays or summer vacations).", "normalised": "First off, let's talk ferries. Think of places like Mumbai to Goa.
