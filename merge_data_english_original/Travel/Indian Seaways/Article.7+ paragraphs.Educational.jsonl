Major ports such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Mumbai, Chennai Port, and Kolkata Port act as crucial hubs for international trade, handling millions of tonnes of cargo annually. Then there's Cochin Shipyard Ltd., which contributes a big portion to the maritime industry. These ports are vital for the import and export of goods ranging from petroleum products to manufactured goods, significantly impacting the Indian economy. Coastal shipping connects major ports and smaller harbours, facilitating the movement of goods and passengers along the coastline. One prominent example is the ferry service connecting Mumbai to Goa, offering a scenic alternative to road or rail travel.

{"unnormalised": "Inland waterways, formed by rivers, canals, and backwaters, present a distinct segment of Indian seaways. The National Waterway 1 (NW-1), also known as the Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system, spans 1620 km from Haldia to Allahabad. Similarly, the Brahmaputra River (NW-2) stretches 891 km from Sadiya to Dhubri. These waterways, though underutilized, hold immense potential for cargo transportation, reducing reliance on congested road and rail networks. Kerala's backwaters, a network of lagoons and canals, are not just scenic tourist attractions but also vital transportation routes for local communities. Houseboats and ferries navigate these waters, connecting villages and facilitating trade in goods like spices and coconuts. You can usually rent a houseboat for approx. ₹8000 per night.", "normalised": "Inland waterways, formed by rivers, canals, and backwaters, present a distinct segment of Indian seaways.

{"unnormalised": "The development and maintenance of Indian seaways face several challenges. Navigational hazards, including shallow waters, siltation, and lack of adequate infrastructure, hinder efficient transportation. Investment in dredging, channel marking, and modernizing port facilities is essential to overcome these obstacles. Environmental concerns, such as pollution from ships and port activities, also demand attention. Stricter regulations and sustainable practices are needed to protect the marine ecosystem. The draft National Maritime Policy of 2030 aims to address some of these challenges.", "normalised": "The development and maintenance of Indian seaways face several challenges.
