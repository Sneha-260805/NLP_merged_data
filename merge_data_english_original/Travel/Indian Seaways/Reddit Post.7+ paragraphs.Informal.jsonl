I'm seriously considering taking a cruise from Mumbai to Goa.

Some folks are raving about the food and the views, while others are complaining about cramped cabins and delays. Anyone have firsthand experience? Is it worth the price?", "normalised": "I saw a package online - three nights, four days for approximately rupee fifteen thousand per person on some cruise liner called 'Angriya'.

{"unnormalised": "Safety is a big concern too. Are these ferries well-maintained? Do they have proper safety gear like life jackets for all passengers? I saw a news report last year about a boat accident in the Ganga (WB) and it freaked me out. Also, is seasickness a major problem? I tend to get a little queasy on boats, so any tips or remedies would be greatly appreciated.", "normalised": "Safety is a big concern too. Are these ferries well-maintained?
