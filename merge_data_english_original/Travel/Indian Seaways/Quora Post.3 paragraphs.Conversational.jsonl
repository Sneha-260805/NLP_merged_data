Think about it, avoiding crazy traffic, getting to see the coastline… pretty awesome, no? I've heard the Andaman ferry from Chennai is quite an experience, though it takes like 2-3 days. There are also cruises from Mumbai to Goa, which are shorter, maybe around 15 hrs. Prices vary, obviously, from maybe ₹5,000 for a basic seat on the ferry to ₹25,000+ for a cabin on a cruise.", "normalised": "Someone asked about travelling via seaways in India.

Imagine sailing past the Konkan coast on 1st Jan, watching the sunrise… much better than being stuck on a crowded highway, right?
