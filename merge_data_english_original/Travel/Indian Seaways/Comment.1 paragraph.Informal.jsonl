{"unnormalised": "Hey, did you guys know you can actually take a ferry from Mumbai to Goa now? It's supposed to take around 14 hrs, which is def longer than a flight but way more scenic, right? I saw an ad online, looks like tickets start from ₹4000, but that was prolly for the basic class. Thinking of trying it out sometime in Dec, maybe around the 25th, for a chill Christmas getaway.
