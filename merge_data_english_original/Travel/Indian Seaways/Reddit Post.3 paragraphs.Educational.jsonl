The timings are usually pretty convenient, with some ferries departing around 10:00 AM and reaching by evening.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit India, planning a trip and thinking of skipping the usual flights and trains?

So, if you're planning a trip then, double-check the weather forecasts and confirm with the operators! Some routes may even get temporarily suspended.
