{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, anyone here ever taken a ferry between, say, Mumbai and Goa? Thinking of ditching the usual flight this time around. The Konkan coastline looks amazing, and I've heard the views from the sea are even better. Plus, flights are costing a bomb during the Diwali season - like Rs. 8000+, one way!", "normalised": "Hey guys, anyone here ever taken a ferry between, say, Mumbai and Goa?

{"unnormalised": "Been researching a bit, and it seems there are a few options. I saw something about a Mumbai-Goa cruise, but that seems more luxury focused. I'm looking for something more... practical? A ferry would be cool. I heard the journey takes approx. 14 hrs. Has anyone done the Mumbai to Mandwa ferry and then taken a bus down the coast? How was it? Any companies you’d recommend (or warn me to avoid)?", "normalised": "Been researching a bit, and it seems there are a few options.

Any insights would be super helpful! Planning this trip for the 26th, and hoping to enjoy some Goan sun! Cheers!", "normalised": "Also, any idea what the ticket prices usually are?
