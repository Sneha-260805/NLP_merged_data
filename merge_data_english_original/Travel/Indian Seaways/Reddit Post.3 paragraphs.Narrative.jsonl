{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I recently took a ferry from Mumbai to Goa, and lemme tell you, it was an experience! Booked the tix online for Rs. 4000 (bit pricey, I know), boarding was at 10:00 AM sharp from the Gateway of India. I was kinda worried abt seasickness, so popped a pill beforehand. The ferry itself was pretty decent – had AC, comfy seats, and a cafeteria selling overpriced butties and chai for ₹50 a pop.", "normalised": "Okay, so I recently took a ferry from Mumbai to Goa, and let me tell you, it was an experience!

{"unnormalised": "The journey took around 14 hrs, which is longer than the train (overnight, usually), but the views! Absolutely worth it. We passed several small islands. Saw some fishing boats too; the fisherman waved. Perfect for taking some Insta-worthy pics. Plus, they had some Bollywood music playing on the speakers, which added to the whole vibe. BTW, if you're planning on doing this, pack some snacks. The cafeteria's choices are limited and expensive.", "normalised": "The journey took around fourteen hours, which is longer than the train (overnight, usually), but the views! Absolutely worth it.

If you're not in a hurry and wanna see the coastline, the Mumbai-Goa ferry is a great option. Just prepone your return booking, as seats get filled quickly, especially during tourist season. And yeah, keep that seasickness pill handy!", "normalised": "Reached Goa at around twelve double zero A-M the next day. Exhausted, but happy.
