{"unnormalised": "First things first, let's talk about the lifeline of Indian cities: the auto-rickshaw. Often affectionately called \"autos,\" these three-wheeled wonders are ubiquitous, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai. Don't be surprised if you see them zipping around at what seems like warp speed! It's crucial to agree on a fare *before* you hop in. A short ride, say, from your hotel to a nearby restaurant, might cost around ₹80-₹120, depending on the city and the time of day. Download apps like Ola or Uber Auto for a more regulated experience, as they often display estimated fares upfront. Remember to keep small change handy!", "normalised": "First things first, let's talk about the lifeline of Indian cities: the auto-rickshaw.

City buses are frequently numbered; for instance, in Bangalore, bus number 335E might take you from Majestic Bus Stand to Electronic City.
