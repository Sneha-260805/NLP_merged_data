{"unnormalised": "Firstly, for intercity travel, buses are a super common and budget-friendly option. You'll see tons of state transport buses (like MSRTC in Maharashtra or KSRTC in Kerala) and private operators. Check out websites like redBus for schedules and prices, but be prepared for potentially bumpy rides and delays. Also, distances can be deceiving; that 500 km trip might take 12 hrs, not 5 hrs. If you are going for a bike trip, make sure the bikes are serviced from companies like Bajaj or TVS before undertaking such long trips.", "normalised": "Firstly, for intercity travel, buses are a super common and budget-friendly option.

{"unnormalised": "Now, for getting around within cities, you've got auto-rickshaws (aka autos, tuk-tuks), taxis, and ride-sharing apps like Ola and Uber. Bargaining with auto drivers is an art form, especially in touristy areas. Always agree on the fare beforehand! Metered taxis are available but sometimes they \"forget\" to use the meter. Ola/Uber usually have surge pricing during peak hours (like 8 PM on a Friday in Bangalore), so keep that in mind. Also metro train systems are available in some cities like Delhi and Kolkata and cost ₹10 - ₹60. Finally, remember to factor in traffic; that 5 km ride in Mumbai can easily take 30 minutes during rush hour!", "normalised": "Now, for getting around within cities, you've got auto-rickshaws (a-k-a autos, tuk-tuks), taxis, and ride-sharing apps like Ola and Uber.
