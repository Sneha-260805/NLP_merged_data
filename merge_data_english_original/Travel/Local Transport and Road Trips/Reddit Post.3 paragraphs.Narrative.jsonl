LOL, that didn't happen. Ended up leaving at 7:30 AM 'cause Sharmaji forgot his charger.", "normalised": "Okay, so last weekend, me and my dosts decided to do a quick road trip from Bangalore to Mysore.

The bill came to ₹250 for 4 of us. We also spotted tons of those private Volvo buses zooming past - those guys are FAST.", "normalised": "The drive itself was pretty chill, though.

Took an auto-rickshaw from the palace to the market - he quoted Rs. 150, but after some bargaining, we got it down to ₹120. Mysore is beautiful, yaar! Definitely recommend it for a weekend getaway.", "normalised": "Reached Mysore around eleven thirty A-M. Did the usual touristy stuff - Mysore Palace, Chamundi Hills.
