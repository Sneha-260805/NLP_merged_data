Anyone done this before? How's the road condition on NH275 these days? Heard there were some bad patches near Mandya last time. Also, any recommendations for good dhabas on the way? Need to fuel up on some tasty South Indian food!", "normalised": "Hey guys, planning a road trip from Bangalore to Mysore next month. Got any tips?

I'm travelling with my family - wife and 2 kids (ages 5 and 8). So need to make sure it's a comfortable journey for them. Planning to stop at Srirangapatna for a quick visit.
