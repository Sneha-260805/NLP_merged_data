It's not just about scenic views and chai stops; it’s about navigating the organised chaos that is Indian roads.

You’ll encounter cows casually chilling in the middle of the highway, requiring a polite but firm \"excuse me, ma'am.\" You’ll find entire families piled onto motorbikes, defying the laws of physics (and probably traffic).

The food is amazing (seriously, try the butter chicken at a dhaba near Murthal), but hygiene standards are...well, let's just say pack some antacids and hope for the best.

{"unnormalised": "And let's discuss the traffic. It's less of a flow and more of a free-for-all. Lanes are merely suggestions. Overtaking is an art form. Indicators are optional. And speed limits? They're just guidelines for tourists, really. Keep your eyes peeled for unexpected speed bumps, especially near smaller villages. You'll be cruising at 80 kmph one moment and then nearly airborne the next. So, drive defensively, always anticipate the worst, and maybe invest in a good dashcam.", "normalised": "And let's discuss the traffic. It's less of a flow and more of a free-for-all.
