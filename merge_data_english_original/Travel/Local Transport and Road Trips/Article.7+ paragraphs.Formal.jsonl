In Mumbai, local trains carry approximately 7.5 million passengers daily, a testament to their crucial role, yet overcrowding remains a significant challenge, especially during peak hours (8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM). Delhi's metro system, on the other hand, offers a relatively modern and efficient alternative, serving an average of 5 million riders per day across its extensive network.

{"unnormalised": "However, the ubiquity of auto-rickshaws cannot be ignored. Found in almost every Indian city, these three-wheeled vehicles offer a convenient, albeit sometimes chaotic, mode of transport for short distances. Fare negotiations are common, and it's advisable to agree on a price before embarking on a journey. Expect to pay around Rs. 30 for a 2 km ride in most cities, though this can vary significantly depending on the time of day and the driver's perception of your bargaining skills.", "normalised": "However, the ubiquity of auto-rickshaws cannot be ignored.
