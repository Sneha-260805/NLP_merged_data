{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I had this crazy idea. I wanted to see Old Delhi, but not in some sanitized, touristy way. I wanted the real deal, the chaotic, beautiful, overwhelming heart of it all. And what better way to experience that than from the back of an auto-rickshaw? My friend, Priya, thought I was nuts. \"Are you serious, Riya? In this heat? And the traffic? You’ll get dust in your chai!” But I was determined.", "normalised": "Okay, so I had this crazy idea. I wanted to see Old Delhi, but not in some sanitized, touristy way.

{"unnormalised": "I started my journey near the Red Fort, a landmark that even *I* couldn't miss. Haggling with the auto drivers was, of course, the first challenge. The first guy wanted Rs. 500 just to take me to Jama Masjid, which Google Maps told me was only like, 2 km away. After a bit of back and forth (and a theatrical sigh from me), I managed to get it down to ₹200. Not bad, eh?", "normalised": "I started my journey near the Red Fort, a landmark that even I couldn't miss. Haggling with the auto drivers was, of course, the first challenge.

{"unnormalised": "The ride itself was an experience. The auto, a bright green and yellow machine, sputtered and coughed its way into the throngs of traffic. Cars, buses, scooters, bicycles, pedestrians, cows – everyone was vying for space. It was exhilarating and terrifying all at once. I swear, we came within inches of a cycle rickshaw at one point!", "normalised": "The ride itself was an experience.

{"unnormalised": "My driver, a man named Salim, was a pro. He navigated the maze of streets with the skill of a seasoned Formula One driver. He knew every pothole, every shortcut, every hidden alleyway. He even pointed out interesting sights along the way. \"That's the famous Karim's,\" he shouted over the din, gesturing to a bustling restaurant. \"Best biryani in Delhi!\" I mentally added it to my list.", "normalised": "My driver, a man named Salim, was a pro.

{"unnormalised": "Jama Masjid was magnificent. The sheer scale of it took my breath away. I spent a good hour wandering around, soaking in the atmosphere. The call to prayer echoed through the courtyard, creating a truly spiritual experience. I even managed to snap a few decent photos despite the crowds.", "normalised": "Jama Masjid was magnificent.

{"unnormalised": "Next, Salim took me to Chandni Chowk, the heart of Old Delhi's market district. It was even more chaotic than I had imagined. Stalls selling everything from spices to sarees lined the streets. The air was thick with the smell of street food. I bravely tried a plate of *gol gappe* from a street vendor; only Rs. 20. They were spicy, tangy, and absolutely delicious. My stomach thanked me later (or not).", "normalised": "Next, Salim took me to Chandni Chowk, the heart of Old Delhi's market district.

{"unnormalised": "Navigating Chandni Chowk in an auto-rickshaw was like trying to thread a needle with a bulldozer. At times, we were literally crawling, inching our way through the crowds. But Salim didn't seem fazed.

{"unnormalised": "We stopped at Dariba Kalan, the silver market. The shops were overflowing with glittering jewelry. I saw necklaces that probably cost more than my entire apartment. It was amazing to see the craftsmanship and the sheer artistry involved.

{"unnormalised": "By the time we reached the spice market, Khari Baoli, I was exhausted but exhilarated. The air was thick with the aroma of chilies, turmeric, and cardamom. I bought a small bag of saffron for my mom, who loves to cook.

{"unnormalised": "My auto-rickshaw adventure through Old Delhi was an unforgettable experience. It was chaotic, overwhelming, and sometimes a little scary. But it was also authentic, vibrant, and incredibly rewarding. I saw a side of Delhi that most tourists never see, and I did it all from the back of a sputtering, yellow and green auto-rickshaw. Totally worth the 6 hours and Rs 800 I ended up paying Salim for the entire day! I'd recommend anyone visiting Delhi to try it! Just prepone all your other plans for the day. You won't regret it.", "normalised": "My auto-rickshaw adventure through Old Delhi was an unforgettable experience. It was chaotic, overwhelming, and sometimes a little scary.
