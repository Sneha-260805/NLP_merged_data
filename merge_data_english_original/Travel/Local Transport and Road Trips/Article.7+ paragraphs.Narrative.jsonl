The initial stretch on the East Coast Road (ECR) was smooth, the highway stretching like a ribbon against the backdrop of the Bay of Bengal. The sunrise was breathtaking, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. I stopped for breakfast at a roadside eatery near Mahabalipuram. Idli-vada and filter coffee for just Rs. 80 – a steal!

{"unnormalised": "Around 10:30 AM, I reached a small town, marked only by a faded signboard. The GPS showed I was still 50 km from Pondicherry. I decided to take a detour off the main highway, hoping to explore the countryside. The roads narrowed even further, winding through fields of paddy and coconut groves. I passed through several villages, each with its own unique charm – children playing cricket, women drawing kolams outside their homes, and men gathered around tea stalls, discussing politics. This was the India I had been yearning to see, raw and unfiltered. I got a flat tire near a small village. I was able to change it, but the spare was not in top condition. I decided to get it repaired in Pondicherry.", "normalised": "Around ten thirty A-M, I reached a small town, marked only by a faded signboard.
