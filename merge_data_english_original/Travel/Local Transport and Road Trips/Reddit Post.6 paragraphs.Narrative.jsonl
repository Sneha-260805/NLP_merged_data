The initial part of the journey on NH48 was smooth, pretty much a breeze. I was behind the wheel for the 1st 250 kms. We stopped at a dhaba near Pune for some chai and vada pav.

My friend Rohan, who considers himself an expert navigator, confidently directed us off the main highway onto what he called a \"shortcut.\" Turns out, his shortcut added another 2 hours to our journey and some serious anxiety about damaging the car.
