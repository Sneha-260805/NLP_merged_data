Google Maps said it was roughly 600 km, predicting around 12 hours of driving time. I was skeptical, knowing how unpredictable Indian highways can be. I was driving a Maruti Suzuki Swift, nothing fancy, but reliable.

Stopped for breakfast around 8:00 AM at a small dhaba near Chitradurga. Had some amazing idli-vada and filter coffee. Total bill: Rs. 120. Gotta love dhaba prices!

{"unnormalised": "Things started getting interesting after Hubli. The highway narrowed down to a 2-lane road in some sections, and the traffic increased considerably. Lots of trucks and buses. Had to be extra careful overtaking. The scenery, however, was getting better. The Western Ghats started looming in the distance. I also encountered a police checkpoint at around 1 PM. They asked for my license and registration. After a quick check, they let me go. Always keep your documents handy, folks!", "normalised": "Things started getting interesting after Hubli.
