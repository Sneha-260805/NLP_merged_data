{"unnormalised": "First, the auto-rickshaw. Ah, the humble auto. Or as I like to call them, \"the chariots of the gods, driven by men with a death wish and a penchant for haggling.\" My first encounter involved trying to explain to a driver in Delhi that I wanted to go to Hauz Khas Village. He nodded sagely, said \"Haanji, madam,\" and then proceeded to take me in the exact opposite direction. Turns out, \"Hauz Khas\" sounds suspiciously like \"Chandni Chowk\" if you're yelling it over the din of honking horns and Bollywood music. The final fare after the scenic tour was, shall we say, a *little* higher than the initial \"Rs. 50\" quoted.", "normalised": "First, the auto-rickshaw. Ah, the humble auto.

{"unnormalised": "Then there was the time I attempted a road trip from Bangalore to Mysore. My friend, bless his adventurous soul, insisted we take a local bus. \"It's an experience!\" he chirped. And he wasn't wrong. It was an experience… of being packed tighter than sardines in a tin can, while listening to a loop of devotional songs at ear-splitting volume. At one point, a goat got on. I kid you not. A literal goat. Number of passengers on the bus: approximately 200. Number of passengers who batted an eye at the goat: zero. Estimated travel time: 8 hrs (instead of 4 hrs by car!).", "normalised": "Then there was the time I attempted a road trip from Bangalore to Mysore.

{"unnormalised": "The trains, oh, the trains! A journey on the Indian Railways is a rite of passage. I booked a 3 AC ticket from Chennai to Madurai, thinking I was being all sophisticated.

{"unnormalised": "The highlight of my train journey was definitely the chai wallah. A tiny man with a booming voice, who somehow managed to navigate the crowded carriages with a tray precariously balanced on his head. \"Chai, chai, garam chai!\" he yelled, offering salvation in a tiny paper cup for the princely sum of Rs. 10. It was the best chai I've ever had. Probably because I was delirious with exhaustion and caffeine deprivation.", "normalised": "The highlight of my train journey was definitely the chai wallah.

{"unnormalised": "Navigating the buses is a whole other comedy of errors. Figuring out the route numbers is like trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphics. Asking for directions usually results in a chorus of well-meaning but conflicting advice, all delivered in rapid-fire Hindi (which, let’s be honest, I only understand about 5%). I often feel like I’m participating in a real-life scavenger hunt, but instead of finding treasure, I’m just trying to locate the right bus stop.", "normalised": "Navigating the buses is a whole other comedy of errors.

Hop on an auto-rickshaw, squeeze onto a bus, or book a train ticket (preferably not during peak season). You'll have stories to tell for years to come. Just remember to pack your sense of humor, your patience, and maybe a strong cup of chai. And always, *always* confirm the price *before* you get in the auto. Trust me on this one.
