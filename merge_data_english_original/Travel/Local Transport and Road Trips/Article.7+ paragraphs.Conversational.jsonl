{"unnormalised": "Let's start with local transport. Forget what you think you know; things work a little differently here. The ubiquitous auto-rickshaw (often just called \"auto\") is your go-to for short distances. Agree on a price *before* you hop in, and don't be afraid to haggle! In cities like Mumbai and Kolkata, the local trains are lifelines. They're crowded, especially during peak hours (9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM), but incredibly efficient and cheap. A single journey can cost as little as Rs. 10, depending on the distance. Consider getting a local travel card for seamless travel. Buses are another option, though they can be slow and sometimes overcrowded. Uber and Ola are readily available in most major cities, offering a more comfortable and predictable experience. Pro tip: download both apps, as availability can vary.", "normalised": "Let's start with local transport. Forget what you think you know; things work a little differently here.

{"unnormalised": "Now, onto the exciting part: road trips! India offers some truly epic routes. Planning is key. First, consider your vehicle. A sturdy SUV is recommended for tackling diverse terrains, especially in the Himalayas or Rajasthan. Ensure your car is serviced and ready for long distances. Next, map out your route. Google Maps is your friend, but be aware that estimated travel times can be optimistic. Roads in India can be unpredictable! Factor in extra time for unexpected delays, such as traffic jams or road repairs. Fuel is generally readily available, but it's wise to fill up whenever you see a reliable petrol pump, especially in remote areas.", "normalised": "Now, onto the exciting part: road trips!
