{"unnormalised": "First things first, planning. A Delhi to Jaipur trip is a classic starting point. It's roughly 280 km, give or take depending on which part of Delhi you're battling your way out of. Budget about 6 hrs, but realistically, account for 8. Why? Because you will inevitably encounter a stray cow, a wedding procession, or just plain inexplicable traffic jams. Embrace the delay! It's part of the adventure.", "normalised": "First things first, planning. A Delhi to Jaipur trip is a classic starting point.

Consider renting a reliable vehicle with good ground clearance. Also, a GPS is essential, even if you think you know the way. Trust me, Indian roads have a habit of playing hide-and-seek. I rely on Google Maps myself.", "normalised": "Vehicle-wise, anything goes. You'll see everything from beat-up Marutis to swanky S-U-Vs tackling these roads. But for a longer trip, safety first!

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s get to the nitty gritty. What makes road trips here truly special? Firstly, the food! Dhabas are your best friend. A plate of steaming rajma chawal for Rs. 80 is unbeatable. Don't be afraid to experiment. Every state has its own culinary gems hiding along the highways. Try the vada pav in Maharashtra or the litti chokha in Bihar.", "normalised": "Now, let’s get to the nitty gritty. What makes road trips here truly special? Firstly, the food!

{"unnormalised": "But what about local transport when you're not on the highway? Auto-rickshaws are a quintessential Indian experience. Haggle hard! That Rs. 50 fare can often be brought down to Rs. 30 with a bit of friendly negotiation. Just remember to smile, even when they try to charge you double just because you're a tourist.", "normalised": "But what about local transport when you're not on the highway?

{"unnormalised": "And don’t forget the trains! While not exactly \"road\" trips, Indian Railways are an adventure in themselves, connecting even the most remote corners of the country. Book a sleeper class ticket and experience the vibrant tapestry of Indian life unfolding before your eyes. A journey from Mumbai to Goa on the Konkan Railway is an absolute must. IRCTC, the official website, is your friend here. I try to book at least 1 month in advance for longer journeys.", "normalised": "And don’t forget the trains!

And most importantly, keep an open mind and a sense of humor. India is a land of contrasts and contradictions, and that's what makes it so endlessly fascinating. So, pack your bags, grab your chai, and hit the road! You won’t regret it.", "normalised": "Finally, remember to be respectful of local customs and traditions. A simple \"Namaste\" goes a long way.
