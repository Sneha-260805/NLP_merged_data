{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm considering two primary routes: NH275 and the state highway via Kanakapura. Google Maps suggests that NH275 is faster, estimating a travel time of approximately 3 hrs. However, I've heard reports of significant traffic congestion, particularly around Mandya. Are there any recent experiences that can validate or refute this? The state highway route, while longer (potentially 4-5 hrs), is reputed to be more scenic. Is the additional travel time worth it for the enhanced views? I'm driving my own vehicle, a Mahindra XUV700, so road conditions are also a key consideration.
