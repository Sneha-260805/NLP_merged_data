{"unnormalised": "First things first, local transport varies wildly. In Mumbai, the local trains are your lifeline, esp during peak hours. Just be prepared for a bit of a crowd. A single journey from Churchgate to Dadar will cost you around ₹10-₹20, depending on the class. Auto-rickshaws are common too, but make sure they use the meter. Uber/Ola are readily available in most cities, but surge pricing can be a killer. Expect to pay anywhere from Rs 150-500 for a ride across town, depending on the time of day and distance.", "normalised": "First things first, local transport varies wildly.
