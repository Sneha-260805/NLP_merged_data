{"unnormalised": "My first experience navigating the Mumbai local trains was, to put it mildly, chaotic. I arrived at CST station around 8:30 AM on a weekday, blissfully unaware of the peak hour frenzy.

{"unnormalised": "I needed to get to Andheri, a journey of approximately 30 km. Consulting the timetable, I found a fast local departing in 7 mins from Platform 4. The challenge was getting *to* Platform 4. Negotiating the crowd felt like running an obstacle course. Hawkers selling everything from vada pav to phone chargers added to the sensory overload. Finally, I spotted the platform indicator, a small screen displaying the train's destination and arrival time – expected at 08:37.", "normalised": "I needed to get to Andheri, a journey of approximately thirty kilometer.

{"unnormalised": "The train pulled in, and the real adventure began. “Space management” took on a whole new meaning as everyone crammed inside. I somehow managed to squeeze myself into a corner, clutching my backpack for dear life. The train lurched forward, and we were off, swaying violently as it picked up speed. Outside, the city flashed by – a blur of buildings, billboards, and busy streets.", "normalised": "The train pulled in, and the real adventure began. “Space management” took on a whole new meaning as everyone crammed inside.

{"unnormalised": "For a budget road trip I once drove from Bangalore to Goa, around 600 km. Started at 6:00 in the morning, hoping to reach by 6 pm but because of bad traffic near Hubli and a flat tire the trip took me almost 14 hrs. Took NH48, the usual route everyone suggests. The scenery was really good, but I really recommend hiring a SUV for this drive since the roads get really rough.", "normalised": "For a budget road trip I once drove from Bangalore to Goa, around six hundred kilometer.

{"unnormalised": "During the road trip, I noticed how many toll booths they have. The average toll came out to be Rs. 7 per kilometer, making it a really expensive roadtrip.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the initial shock of the Mumbai locals, and the unexpected challenges on the Bangalore-Goa road trip, both experiences left me with unforgettable stories. They’re a testament to the vibrant, chaotic, and sometimes unpredictable nature of travel in India, whether it's a daily commute or a cross-state adventure. These experiences made me appreciate the convenience of ride sharing apps like Ola and Uber, especially for shorter distances like 5 km to travel within the city.", "normalised": "Despite the initial shock of the Mumbai locals, and the unexpected challenges on the Bangalore-Goa road trip, both experiences left me with unforgettable stories.
