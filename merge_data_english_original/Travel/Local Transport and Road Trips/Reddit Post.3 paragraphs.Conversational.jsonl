{"unnormalised": "Also, seriously debating whether to take the regular NICE road or the state highway (SH 17). NICE road is faster, maybe around 3 hrs, but the toll costs like ₹600 these days.

I am estimating to spend about Rs. 5000 for the round trip including petrol, tolls, and food (for 2 people). I am driving a Maruti Suzuki Swift which gives mileage of 20 kmpl.
