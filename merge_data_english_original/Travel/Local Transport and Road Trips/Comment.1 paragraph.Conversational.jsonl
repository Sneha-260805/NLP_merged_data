{"unnormalised": "Auto-rickshaws are usually the best bet for short distances, like from CST to Crawford Market, should cost you around Rs. 80-100. But for a longer trip, like Mumbai to Pune, I'd suggest taking the expressway, it's a 3-4 hr drive depending on traffic. You can hire a cab for about ₹3000-₹4000 or even cheaper if you book in advance via Ola or Uber. Just remember to factor in the toll charges, which can be around Rs. 300.", "normalised": "Auto-rickshaws are usually the best bet for short distances, like from C-S-T to Crawford Market, should cost you around rupee eighty to one hundred.
