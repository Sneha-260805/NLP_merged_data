{"unnormalised": "For road trips around Bangalore, remember that NH44 and NH75 are usually the best bets. NH44 can get you to Hyderabad in around 6 hrs, maybe 7 if you take it easy. Check toll charges beforehand; expect to pay around Rs. 500-700 one way. And always carry your DL (driving license) & RC (Registration Certificate) of the vehicle. Plan your pit stops; CCDs & Indian Oil petrol pumps are good options, spaced roughly every 100 km.
