My friend Rakesh kept telling me about the potential returns, especially in companies like Reliance which were trading around Rs. 2500 back then. He showed me his portfolio which had grown by 15% in just 6 months! Still, I only invested a small amount, maybe ₹5000, in Tata Motors. Now, after almost 1 year, it's showing a decent profit, so I'm thinking of adding more, maybe looking at SBI stocks next. Will wait for the market to correct a bit though!", "normalised": "Honestly, I was super hesitant to invest in the stock market initially.
