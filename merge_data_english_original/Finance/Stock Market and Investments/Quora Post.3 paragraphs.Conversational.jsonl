My friend suggested I start with small-cap stocks, but tbh I'm scared! Has anyone had experience investing in Indian markets like BSE or NSE? What are some things a newbie like me should keep in mind?", "normalised": "Hey folks, so I'm kind of new to this whole investing thing, and I've been reading up on the stock market.

{"unnormalised": "I saw an ad for a mutual fund promising 15% returns p.a., which sounds amazing, but my gut feeling is that something's fishy. Is it realistic to expect such high returns consistently? I also keep hearing about SIPs – are they a good idea for someone just starting out? I've got about ₹10,000 I can afford to invest monthly. Also, what about brokerage accounts? Should I go with Zerodha or Upstox, or are there better options in India?", "normalised": "I saw an ad for a mutual fund promising fifteen percent returns per annum, which sounds amazing, but my gut feeling is that something's fishy.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, a very n00b question. Is there a 'best' time of the month, or day of the week, to actually *buy* stocks? Like, does waiting till the end of the month when salaries come in and people have more cash make any difference? Or is it all just random chance? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from those who've been playing the market for a few years now. Thanks in advance!", "normalised": "And finally, a very noob question.
