{"unnormalised": "Investing in the stock market can seem daunting initially, but understanding the fundamental concepts can make the process more approachable. At its core, the stock market is where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. When you purchase a share, you are essentially buying a small portion of ownership in that company. The value of these shares fluctuates based on various factors, including the company's performance, overall market trends, and investor sentiment. Common terms you'll encounter include BSE Sensex, NSE Nifty, IPOs, and mutual funds. For instance, a company like Reliance Industries might see its share price increase or decrease based on its quarterly earnings reports or new product launches. It's important to understand these fluctuations and the factors that influence them before making investment decisions.", "normalised": "investing in the stock market can seem daunting initially, but understanding the fundamental concepts can make the process more approachable. at its core, the stock market is where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. when you purchase a share, you are essentially buying a small portion of ownership in that company. the value of these shares fluctuates based on various factors, including the company's performance, overall market trends, and investor sentiment. common terms you'll encounter include B-S-E sensex, N-S-E nifty, I-P-Os, and mutual funds. for instance, a company like reliance industries might see its share price increase or decrease based on its quarterly earnings reports or new product launches. it's important to understand these fluctuations and the factors that influence them before making investment decisions."}
{"unnormalised": "For beginners in India, a prudent investment strategy often involves a diversified approach. Rather than putting all your capital into a single stock, consider allocating your investments across different sectors and asset classes. Mutual funds, particularly index funds and ETFs, offer an easy way to achieve this diversification, as they invest in a basket of stocks. Another option is systematic investment plans (SIPs), which allow you to invest a fixed amount regularly, mitigating the risk of timing the market incorrectly. E.g., one could invest Rs. 5000 per month in an index fund tracking the NIFTY 50. Remember, investments are subject to market risks, so conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before investing.", "normalised": "for beginners in india, a prudent investment strategy often involves a diversified approach. rather than putting all your capital into a single stock, consider allocating your investments across different sectors and asset classes. mutual funds, particularly index funds and E-T-Fs, offer an easy way to achieve this diversification, as they invest in a basket of stocks. another option is systematic investment plans (S-I-Ps), which allow you to invest a fixed amount regularly, mitigating the risk of timing the market incorrectly. for example, one could invest rupees five thousand per month in an index fund tracking the N-I-F-T-Y fifty. remember, investments are subject to market risks, so conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before investing."}

Also, don't believe random \"investment tips\" that you see on social media, especially not the ones promising 20% returns in a short amount of time. It is better to be cautious and invest slowly in companies and mutual funds that you understand. A long-term investment horizon is generally recommended, allowing your investments to grow over time.
