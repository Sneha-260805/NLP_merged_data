{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, newbie here trying to understand the stock market! Heard a lot about it from my office colleagues, especially since the market's been going crazy lately. They keep talking about Nifty 50, Sensex, and terms like \"bull market\" and \"bear market.\" Frankly, it all goes over my head. I was wondering if someone could explain the basics in simple terms? Like, what's the difference between investing in mutual funds vs. buying individual stocks? Is it true that you can start with as little as Rs. 500 through SIPs? Also, which are considered safe investment options for beginners in India right now?", "normalised": "Hey guys, newbie here trying to understand the stock market!

{"unnormalised": "And what about the risk factor? One colleague mentioned something about SEBI and regulations protecting investors. Are there any specific brokers I should be looking at, or ones I should avoid? My friend invested through Zerodha, but I am not sure. Also, any tips for doing some basic research before investing? I saw on TV that Tata Motors shares are at Rs. 800+ – is that a good investment? Finally, what happens if the company goes bankrupt? Do I lose all my money?", "normalised": "And what about the risk factor? One colleague mentioned something about S-E-B-I and regulations protecting investors.
