{"unnormalised": "Basically, Sensex and Nifty 50 are like scoreboards for the Indian stock market. The Sensex tracks the 30 largest companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and the Nifty 50 tracks the top 50 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). If the Sensex goes up, it generally means the market is doing well. You can't directly *invest* in these indexes, but you *can* invest in index funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that mimic their performance.

Consider diversifying too – maybe put ₹2000 in a Nifty 50 fund, ₹1500 in a small-cap fund, and ₹1500 in a debt fund. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint!
