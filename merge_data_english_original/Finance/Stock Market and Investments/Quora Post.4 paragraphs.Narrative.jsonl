I remember back in 2018, a friend, let's call him Rohan, convinced me to invest in a penny stock. He said it was a sure thing, \"guaranteed returns, bhai!\". I put in ₹5000, thinking it was a small amount to risk. Within a week, the stock price plummeted by 80%.

I started reading articles on Investopedia and followed some reputable analysts on Twitter. I also opened a Demat account with Zerodha – their interface seemed less intimidating. Started small, investing in blue-chip companies like Reliance and TCS. Didn’t put in more than Rs. 2000 at first, just wanted to get a feel for how things moved.", "normalised": "After that initial disaster, I decided to actually learn something before throwing more money away.
