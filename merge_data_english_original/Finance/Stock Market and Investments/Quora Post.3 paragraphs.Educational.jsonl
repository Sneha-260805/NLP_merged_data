{"unnormalised": "Well, before you dive into the Dalal Street scene, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, understanding basic financial terms is crucial. Don't get intimidated by terms like \"NSE,\" \"BSE,\" \"IPO,\" or \"Sensex.\" There are tons of free resources online to get you started.
