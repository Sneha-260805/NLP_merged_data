Whether it's for that dream house in Bandra, a swanky new car, or to finally start that business you've always talked about over chai, understanding loans and credit is super important. Don't just jump in like Aisha did, she took out a personal loan at 15% interest and now regrets not shopping around!", "normalised": "Okay, so you're thinking about taking a loan, huh?
