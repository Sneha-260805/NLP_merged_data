{"unnormalised": "Let's break this down, shall we? Firstly, the bank's gonna charge you interest, maybe around 10-15% p.a., depending on your credit score and how nicely you smile at the loan officer. Credit cards? Even worse, they can easily hit 30-40% APR. Now, you're borrowing money that's actively accruing interest. Crypto, on the other hand, might go to the moon, or it might decide to visit the bottom of the Mariana Trench. No guarantees, my friend!", "normalised": "Let's break this down, shall we?
