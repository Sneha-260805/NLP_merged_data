A home loan from HDFC or SBI could get you closer to owning that apartment, usually available up to 80% of the property value. A personal loan, on the other hand, offered by most banks (like ICICI) can be used for almost anything, from a wedding to medical expenses. Then there are education loans to fund degrees from places like IIT or IIM, with interest rates varying depending on the bank and the course. Don’t forget about vehicle loans; you can probably get a loan for up to 85% of the on-road price.", "normalised": "Let us break it down, shall we? First off, there are different types of loans.
