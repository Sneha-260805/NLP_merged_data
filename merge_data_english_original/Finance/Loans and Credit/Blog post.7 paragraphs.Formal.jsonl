{"unnormalised": "The loan amount can vary significantly. For instance, one might borrow ₹50,000 for a minor home repair or ₹5,00,000 for a more substantial expense. Lenders often stipulate a repayment tenure ranging from 12 months to 60 months. A shorter tenure results in higher EMIs but lower overall interest paid, while a longer tenure reduces the monthly burden but increases the total cost of the loan. It's important to use an EMI calculator to assess the implications of different tenures.", "normalised": "The loan amount can vary significantly.
