Many folks get confused between the two, thinking a credit card is basically a small loan. While there are similarities, the repayment structures and interest rates are very different. Think of a personal loan, say a loan of Rs. 5 lakh from HDFC Bank, as a lump sum you pay back in EMIs, usually over 1 to 5 yrs. Interest rates can vary from 10% to 20% p.a., depending on your credit score and the lender.", "normalised": "I'm seeing a lot of questions about personal loans and credit cards, so let's break it it down a bit.

If you don't pay the full amount by the due date, usually around the 20th of each month, you'll be charged interest, and those rates are much higher, often around 35% to 40% APR. Paying just the min due amount (maybe ₹1000) is a slippery slope.", "normalised": "Credit cards, on the other hand, offer a revolving line of credit.

{"unnormalised": "The key difference also lies in their usage. Personal loans are better for larger, planned expenses like a home renovation or medical bills. Credit cards are convenient for smaller, everyday purchases. However, if you're only making min payments on your card, a personal loan might be a better option to consolidate that debt at a lower interest rate.

Always read the fine print and compare options from different banks and NBFCs. For example, Bajaj Finserv offers loans and credit options, but ensure you understand the processing fees (often around 2% + GST).
