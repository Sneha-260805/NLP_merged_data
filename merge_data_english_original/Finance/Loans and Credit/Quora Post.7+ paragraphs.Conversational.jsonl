A good score (anything above 750, ideally) means lenders see you as reliable and are more likely to give you a loan at a decent interest rate. You can check it for free on sites like Paisabazaar or BankBazaar. Don’t take loans from any random app claiming to give instant loan of ₹50000.", "normalised": "First off, understanding your C-I-B-I-L score is crucial. It is like your financial report card.

{"unnormalised": "Now, there are different types of loans. Home loans are probably the biggest ones people take, usually for buying a house. Banks like SBI, HDFC, and ICICI offer them. The interest rates vary, usually around 8% p.a. right now, but it depends on the market and your credit score. Make sure you shop around and compare. Also, don't forget to factor in processing fees, which can be a couple of thousand rupees (Rs. 2000 or so).", "normalised": "Now, there are different types of loans.

{"unnormalised": "Then you've got personal loans. These are unsecured, meaning you don't need to put up any collateral, like gold or property. Because of that, the interest rates are higher – often in the range of 12% to 20%. People use them for all sorts of things: weddings, medical emergencies, or consolidating debt. I wouldn’t recommend taking a personal loan of, let’s say, Rs. 1,00,000 just to buy the latest iPhone. Think carefully before you commit to such loans. Always check the EMI which one has to pay after loan disbursement. The EMI can be easily calculated on different bank websites.", "normalised": "Then you have got personal loans.

{"unnormalised": "Education loans are another common type, especially for students pursuing higher studies, either in India or abroad.

{"unnormalised": "Credit cards are like mini-loans. Use them responsibly, and they can be great for building your credit score and earning rewards. But if you don't pay your bills on time, the interest charges can be insane – often 3% per month or even higher! That translates to something like 36% APR! So, make sure you pay the full amount due every month. I remember a friend of mine got into a real mess with his credit card debt. He owed like ₹20,000 and ended up paying almost double that in interest because he only paid the minimum due each month.", "normalised": "Credit cards are like mini-loans.

{"unnormalised": "A final tip: always read the fine print before signing any loan agreement. Understand the interest rate, repayment terms, and any hidden charges. Don't be afraid to ask questions and clarify anything you're unsure about.

Also, compare loan offers from different financial institutions.", "normalised": "A final tip: always read the fine print before signing any loan agreement.
