{"unnormalised": "One of the first things to understand is the interest rate. Personal loan interest rates in India can range from 10.5% to 24% p.a. (per annum). This rate depends on factors like your credit score (CIBIL score), income, and the lending institution. A good credit score of 750+ can help you secure a lower interest rate. Banks like SBI, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank are major players in the personal loan market. Always check the processing fees, which can be around 1% to 3% of the loan amount.", "normalised": "one of the first things to understand is the interest rate. personal loan interest rates in India can range from ten point five percent to twenty four percent p.a.

{"unnormalised": "Loan tenure is another important aspect. You typically have the option to repay the loan over a period ranging from 1 to 5 years. Choosing a shorter tenure means higher EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments) but lower overall interest paid. A longer tenure means lower EMIs but significantly higher interest payments. For instance, a loan of ₹5 lakh at 12% interest for 3 years will have a different EMI than the same loan for 5 years. Use online EMI calculators to compare scenarios.", "normalised": "loan tenure is another important aspect. you typically have the option to repay the loan over a period ranging from one to five years. choosing a shorter tenure means higher E-M-I-s (equated monthly installments) but lower overall interest paid. a longer tenure means lower E-M-I-s but significantly higher interest payments. for instance, a loan of rupee five lakh at twelve percent interest for three years will have a different E-M-I than the same loan for five years. use online E-M-I calculators to compare scenarios."}
{"unnormalised": "Eligibility criteria are also key. Lenders typically require you to be a salaried employee or a self-employed professional with a stable income. Age limits generally range from 21 to 60 years. You'll need documents like your Aadhaar card, PAN card, salary slips (for salaried individuals), and bank statements. Self-employed individuals might need to provide income tax returns and business registration documents. Many NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) also offer personal loans with slightly different criteria.", "normalised": "eligibility criteria are also key. lenders typically require you to be a salaried employee or a self-employed professional with a stable income. age limits generally range from twenty one to sixty years. you will need documents like your Aadhaar card, P-A-N card, salary slips (for salaried individuals), and bank statements. self-employed individuals might need to provide income tax returns and business registration documents. many N-B-F-Cs (non-banking financial companies) also offer personal loans with slightly different criteria."}
{"unnormalised": "Beware of hidden charges. Always read the fine print of the loan agreement. Look out for prepayment penalties, late payment fees, and foreclosure charges. Prepaying the loan before the tenure ends can save you interest, but some lenders might charge a penalty for doing so. For example, a prepayment charge could be 2% to 4% of the outstanding loan amount. Understanding these costs upfront can prevent unpleasant surprises later.", "normalised": "beware of hidden charges. always read the fine print of the loan agreement. look out for prepayment penalties, late payment fees, and foreclosure charges. prepaying the loan before the tenure ends can save you interest, but some lenders might charge a penalty for doing so. for example, a prepayment charge could be two percent to four percent of the outstanding loan amount. understanding these costs upfront can prevent unpleasant surprises later."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, shop around and compare offers. Don't settle for the first loan offer you receive. Compare interest rates, fees, and terms from different lenders. Online aggregators can help you compare multiple offers quickly. Websites like BankBazaar and PaisaBazaar provide comparative information. Remember, a slightly lower interest rate can save you thousands of rupees over the loan tenure. Before committing to a personal loan, ensure it aligns with your financial goals and repayment capacity.", "normalised": "finally, shop around and compare offers. don't settle for the first loan offer you receive. compare interest rates, fees, and terms from different lenders. online aggregators can help you compare multiple offers quickly. websites like BankBazaar and PaisaBazaar provide comparative information. remember, a slightly lower interest rate can save you thousands of rupees over the loan tenure. before committing to a personal loan, ensure it aligns with your financial goals and repayment capacity."}
