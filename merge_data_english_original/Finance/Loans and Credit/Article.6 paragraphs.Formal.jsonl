{"unnormalised": "Understanding the diverse array of loan options is paramount. In India, loans are broadly classified into secured and unsecured categories. Secured loans, such as home loans offered by HDFC at 8.5% p.a. or vehicle loans from SBI at 9% p.a., require collateral in the form of assets like property or vehicles. Unsecured loans, including personal loans offered by ICICI Bank, typically carry higher interest rates due to the increased risk for the lender. Credit cards, issued by various banks like Axis Bank with interest rates as high as 36% p.a., provide a revolving line of credit, offering flexibility but also posing the risk of accumulating debt if not managed responsibly.", "normalised": "Understanding the diverse array of loan options is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Interest rates are a crucial determinant of the overall cost of borrowing. In India, interest rates are influenced by several factors, including the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate, the lender's risk assessment, and the borrower's credit score. Fixed-rate loans offer stability with a constant interest rate throughout the loan tenure, while floating-rate loans are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions. Understanding the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which includes interest and other fees, is essential for comparing loan products effectively. A processing fee of 1% - 2% is also usually charged on the loan amount.", "normalised": "Interest rates are a crucial determinant of the overall cost of borrowing.

{"unnormalised": "Credit scores, typically ranging from 300 to 900, play a pivotal role in determining loan eligibility and interest rates. A high credit score, often above 750, demonstrates creditworthiness and increases the likelihood of loan approval at favorable terms.

Regularly monitoring your credit report and addressing any discrepancies is crucial for maintaining a healthy credit profile.", "normalised": "Credit scores, typically ranging from three hundred to nine hundred, play a pivotal role in determining loan eligibility and interest rates.

{"unnormalised": "Repayment terms significantly impact the affordability of a loan. Loan tenures can range from a few months for short-term loans to several years for long-term loans like home loans. Longer tenures reduce monthly installments but increase the total interest paid over the loan's life. Prepayment options allow borrowers to repay the loan before the scheduled end date, potentially saving on interest costs. However, some lenders may charge prepayment penalties, typically around 2% - 5% of the outstanding loan amount.", "normalised": "Repayment terms significantly impact the affordability of a loan.
