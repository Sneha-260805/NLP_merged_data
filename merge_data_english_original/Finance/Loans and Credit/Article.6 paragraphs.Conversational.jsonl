{"unnormalised": "First things first, let's talk types. You've got personal loans, home loans, car loans, education loans… the list goes on! Personal loans are usually unsecured, meaning you don't need to put up any collateral like gold or property. They're great for covering unexpected expenses or consolidating debt, but the interest rates are generally higher, say around 12% to 20%. Home loans, on the other hand, are secured by your property and often have interest rates around 8.5% to 10%.

{"unnormalised": "So, how do banks decide if you're loan-worthy? They look at your CIBIL score, which is a three-digit number ranging from 300 to 900. A higher score means you're a reliable borrower.
