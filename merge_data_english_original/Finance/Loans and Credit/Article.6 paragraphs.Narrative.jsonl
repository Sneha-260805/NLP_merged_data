My small business, a tiffin service catering to office-goers in Bandra, was facing a slump. The rains meant fewer people venturing out, and the rising prices of vegetables were eating into my already thin margins. I needed a solution, and fast. That's when I started exploring different avenues for securing a business loan. I heard good things about Mudra loans from my friend Suresh.", "normalised": "The monsoon had just broken in Mumbai, and like everyone else, I, Rohan Verma, was feeling the pinch.
