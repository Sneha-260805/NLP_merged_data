{"unnormalised": "Before you apply for a personal loan in India, several crucial factors need careful consideration. Ignoring these aspects can lead to financial strain in the long run. One of the most important is the interest rate offered by the bank or NBFC. Compare rates from multiple institutions. For example, SBI might offer a personal loan at 10.5% p.a., while HDFC could offer it at 11% p.a. A difference of 0.5% may seem small, but on a loan of Rs. 5 lakh, the cumulative impact over 5 yrs can be substantial.", "normalised": "Before you apply for a personal loan in India, several crucial factors need careful consideration.

For example, S-B-I might offer a personal loan at ten point five percent p.a., while H-D-F-C could offer it at eleven percent p.a. A difference of zero point five percent may seem small, but on a loan of rupee five lakh, the cumulative impact over five years can be substantial."}
{"unnormalised": "Secondly, thoroughly examine all associated fees and charges. These often include processing fees (typically around 1-3% of the loan amount), prepayment charges, and late payment penalties. Some lenders also levy hidden charges. Ensure full transparency. Read the fine print of the loan agreement carefully. For instance, defaulting on your EMI of Rs 10,000 might attract a penalty of Rs. 500 plus interest on the overdue amount.", "normalised": "Secondly, thoroughly examine all associated fees and charges.

{"unnormalised": "Credit score is also very important. A high CIBIL score (ideally 750+) significantly improves your chances of loan approval at favorable interest rates. Check your credit score via platforms like Experian or CRIF High Mark. Address any discrepancies or errors immediately to improve your creditworthiness. A score below 650 may result in loan rejection or higher interest rates.", "normalised": "Credit score is also very important. A high C-I-B-I-L score (ideally seven hundred and fifty plus) significantly improves your chances of loan approval at favorable interest rates. Check your credit score via platforms like Experian or C-R-I-F High Mark. Address any discrepancies or errors immediately to improve your creditworthiness. A score below six hundred and fifty may result in loan rejection or higher interest rates."}
{"unnormalised": "Your repayment capacity is equally critical. Calculate your existing EMIs and monthly expenses to determine how much you can comfortably afford to repay each month. Avoid over-borrowing based on overly optimistic assumptions. For instance, if your monthly income is Rs. 50,000 and you already have EMIs of Rs. 15,000, borrowing an additional Rs. 20,000 EMI may put a significant strain on your finances.", "normalised": "Your repayment capacity is equally critical.

For instance, if your monthly income is rupee fifty thousand and you already have E-M-I-s of rupee fifteen thousand, borrowing an additional rupee twenty thousand E-M-I may put a significant strain on your finances."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, assess the loan tenure. Opt for a shorter tenure to minimize the total interest paid, but ensure that the EMIs remain manageable. A longer tenure reduces the EMI amount but increases the overall interest burden. For a loan of Rs. 3 lakh, a 3 yr tenure versus a 5 yr tenure will have very different total outlays, even though the monthly installments will be lower with the 5 yr option. Careful planning will ensure you don’t overextend yourself.", "normalised": "Finally, assess the loan tenure.
