I took a personal loan of Rs. 2,00,000 last year from HDFC Bank to prepone my sister's wedding and honestly, the process wasn't as scary as I initially thought.

{"unnormalised": "First things first, shop around! Don't just jump at the first offer you see from SBI or ICICI Bank. Websites like BankBazaar and Paisabazaar let you compare interest rates and processing fees from various lenders. I found a difference of almost 0.5% in interest rates, which adds up when you’re talking about a loan of 2 lakh rupees or more. Also, watch out for hidden charges! These guys are smart.", "normalised": "First things first, shop around! Don't just jump at the first offer you see from S-B-I or I-C-I-C-I Bank.

{"unnormalised": "Next, figure out how much you actually need. Don't be tempted to borrow more just because you can. A higher loan amount means higher EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments), and that’s extra stress on your monthly budget. I needed exactly Rs. 2,00,000, so that's what I applied for. Remember, a loan tenure that stretches out too long at 5 yrs can lead to paying much more interest overall, even if the monthly payments seem manageable.", "normalised": "Next, figure out how much you actually need.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, pay your EMIs on time! Late payments can seriously dent your credit score (CIBIL score), which will make it harder to get loans in the future. I set up auto-debit from my account so I never miss a payment. It's been almost a year now, and I’ve paid off about 1/3 of the loan.
