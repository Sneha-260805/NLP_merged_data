It's like joining a gym – everyone *thinks* they'll get buff, but most end up just paying a monthly fee and feeling guilty.

Credit cards are even worse – those little plastic devils whispering sweet nothings of 0% interest schemes. Just remember, that 0% turns into a whopping 3.5% per month if you miss the due date. My friend, Rajat, learned that the hard way, and now he’s eating Maggi for dinner every night for the next 6 months to pay off his Rs. 25000 debt.
