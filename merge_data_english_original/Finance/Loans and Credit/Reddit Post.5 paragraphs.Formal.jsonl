{"unnormalised": "So, I've been looking into taking out a loan, and frankly, the whole process is a bit of a headache. I'm aiming for a personal loan of around ₹5 lakhs, but the interest rates from different banks are all over the place. SBI is offering something around 10.5% p.a., but HDFC is quoting me 11.25%. Is that a significant difference in the long run? I'm a bit confused about how to calculate the total repayment amount.", "normalised": "So, I've been looking into taking out a loan, and frankly, the whole process is a bit of a headache.
