That’s probably only for some super-elite customer with a credit score of 900 or something! For the rest of us mortals, the rate might be closer to 10-12%, or even higher if your credit history isn't sparkling clean. Always compare offers from different banks. SBI, HDFC, ICICI... they all have different schemes.
