{"unnormalised": "First, there was the education loan. Me, fresh out of college, armed with a B.Com degree and dreams of conquering the corporate world (spoiler alert: that didn't happen right away). I needed ₹2000000 (that’s 20 lakh, for those playing at home). The bank manager, a stern gentleman with a mustache that could rival a walrus, grilled me for what felt like 3 hrs straight. He wanted to know everything – my family history, my career prospects, and whether I knew the difference between a fixed and floating interest rate. I barely knew the difference between chai and coffee at that point!", "normalised": "First, there was the education loan. Me, fresh out of college, armed with a B.

I found the perfect place for Rs. 1.5 crore, a cozy little space that was conveniently located next to a noisy construction site and a perpetually overflowing garbage bin. But hey, it was *mine*… well, the bank's for the next 25 years. The paperwork alone weighed more than my entire luggage allowance on an international flight. I think I signed my name at least 500 times, and half the documents were in legalese I couldn't understand even after 5 cups of chai.", "normalised": "Then came the home loan.

{"unnormalised": "And who can forget the personal loan? This one was a doozy. See, my cousin’s wedding was coming up, and you know how it is. Everyone expects you to show up looking like a Bollywood star, draped in gold and diamonds. My budget? Let’s just say it was closer to that of a struggling auto-rickshaw driver. So, I did what any self-respecting Indian would do – I took out a personal loan for ₹50000. The interest rate was higher than the Himalayas, but hey, I looked fabulous at the wedding!", "normalised": "And who can forget the personal loan? This one was a doozy.
