{"unnormalised": "It all started, as many financial woes do, with a wedding. My cousin, Priya Sharma, was getting married, and the pressure to contribute a substantial gift (read: enough to not be the *kanjoos* relative) was immense. My savings? Let's just say they were enough for a decent saree, not a shimmering gold bracelet. That's when I first considered a personal loan. I’d heard horror stories, like that of Uncle Rajesh who took a loan from a dodgy moneylender at 24% interest, but Priya's wedding was on 15/11/2024, and I felt I had no choice.", "normalised": "It all started, as many financial woes do, with a wedding.

{"unnormalised": "My first stop was SBI, naturally. Everyone I knew had an account there. The process felt like wading through treacle. Endless forms, copies of my Aadhaar card, PAN card, IT returns… it was a bureaucratic jungle. After 3 weeks, and countless visits, I was informed that my CIBIL score, at 680, was \"borderline.\" Borderline! It felt like a personal insult. I was then told that while they *could* approve the loan, the interest rate would be a hefty 12.5% p.a. No thank you.", "normalised": "My first stop was S-B-I, naturally.

{"unnormalised": "Desperate, I turned to the online loan aggregators. The ads promised \"instant approval,\" \"lowest interest rates,\" and \"hassle-free process.\" Naturally, none of it was true. One platform, LoanShark.in, approved a loan of Rs. 50,000 at an unbelievable 9% interest! I filled out the application, uploaded all the documents, and then… nothing.
