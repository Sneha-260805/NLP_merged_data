{"unnormalised": "Buying a home in Mumbai seemed like a distant dream. I, like many middle-class Indians, always thought of it as something only achievable much later in life, if at all. Rent was eating up a significant portion of my salary – about 40% to be precise – and the idea of building equity felt incredibly appealing. But the sheer size of property prices in the city, often quoted in crores (1 crore = 10 million), was daunting.", "normalised": "Buying a home in Mumbai seemed like a distant dream.

{"unnormalised": "My journey started with countless online searches. I scoured websites comparing interest rates offered by different banks. HDFC, ICICI, SBI – they all seemed to have a confusing array of loan products. Some offered fixed rates, others floating. The fine print was a nightmare – processing fees, prepayment penalties, insurance costs – it all added up. I saw rates advertised as low as 8.25% p.a. but quickly realized that was often just a teaser rate for the first year.", "normalised": "My journey started with countless online searches.

{"unnormalised": "The initial loan amount I was eligible for was Rs. 75 lakh. Not bad, but still not enough to buy the 2BHK I had my eye on in Andheri. I considered increasing the loan tenure to 30 yrs to reduce the EMI, but the thought of being in debt for that long felt scary. Plus, the total interest paid over such a long period would be significantly higher.", "normalised": "The initial loan amount I was eligible for was rupee seventy five lakh.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my loan was approved. The EMI came out to be Rs. 63,000 per month. It's a substantial amount, but knowing that I'm building equity and finally owning a piece of Mumbai makes it all worthwhile. The flat number is B-204, and hopefully in the coming years its value will only appreciate, offsetting the interest I’ll pay back on this loan!", "normalised": "Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my loan was approved.
