Remember, borrowing is a serious business, but a little laughter along the way can make the whole process a lot less daunting. Just don't spend all the borrowed money on a lifetime supply of jalebis… unless, of course, that’s your dream. Then, by all means, live your best (and slightly sugary) life. Just maybe factor in the potential dentist bills.", "normalised": "so, there you have it – a humorous (and hopefully helpful) guide to loans and credit in India. remember, borrowing is a serious business, but a little laughter along the way can make the whole process a lot less daunting. just don't spend all the borrowed money on a lifetime supply of jalebis… unless, of course, that’s your dream. then, by all means, live your best (and slightly sugary) life. just maybe factor in the potential dentist bills."}
