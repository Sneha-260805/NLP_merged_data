{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about taking a personal loan for a cousin's wedding. Is it a good idea? Honestly, it's tricky. On one hand, you want to help family. On the other, personal loans come with interest rates that can be pretty steep, like 12% or even 15% p.a. These rates can climb even higher depending on your credit score. You gotta be super sure you can repay it on time, every month, or else your CIBIL score will take a beating.", "normalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about taking a personal loan for a cousin's wedding.

{"unnormalised": "Also, consider your cousin's actual needs. Is a lavish wedding really necessary? Maybe suggest alternatives like a simple ceremony and a smaller gathering. A smaller loan of say, ₹50,000 from friends and family may be better. See if other family members can chip in too!
