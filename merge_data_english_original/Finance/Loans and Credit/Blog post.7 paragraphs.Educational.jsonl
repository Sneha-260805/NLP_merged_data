{"unnormalised": "First, let's differentiate between loans and credit. A loan is a lump sum of money borrowed from a lender with a fixed repayment schedule and interest rate. Credit, on the other hand, is a line of borrowing that you can access up to a certain limit. Credit cards are a prime example. Understanding the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), often quoted as a percentage like 12.5% or 15%, is key when comparing credit options.", "normalised": "first, let's differentiate between loans and credit. a loan is a lump sum of money borrowed from a lender with a fixed repayment schedule and interest rate. credit, on the other hand, is a line of borrowing that you can access up to a certain limit. credit cards are a prime example. understanding the Annual Percentage Rate (A-P-R), often quoted as a percentage like twelve point five percent or fifteen percent, is key when comparing credit options."}
{"unnormalised": "Home loans, or housing loans, are a common type of loan, often taken for periods of 15-25 years. These are usually secured loans, meaning the property itself acts as collateral. Personal loans are unsecured, meaning they don't require collateral, but typically come with higher interest rates, perhaps around 11% - 18%. Car loans fall somewhere in between, with the car itself serving as collateral. Remember to check the processing fees, which can be a flat fee like Rs. 2000 or a percentage of the loan amount.", "normalised": "home loans, or housing loans, are a common type of loan, often taken for periods of fifteen to twenty five years. these are usually secured loans, meaning the property itself acts as collateral. personal loans are unsecured, meaning they don't require collateral, but typically come with higher interest rates, perhaps around eleven percent to eighteen percent. car loans fall somewhere in between, with the car itself serving as collateral. remember to check the processing fees, which can be a flat fee like rupees two thousand or a percentage of the loan amount."}

Use online EMI calculators to understand how the interest rate, loan tenure, and loan amount affect your monthly payments. For example, a Rs. 10 lakh loan at 8% interest for 10 years will have a different EMI than a Rs. 5 lakh loan at 10% interest for 5 years.", "normalised": "another factor to consider is the E-M-I (Equated Monthly Installment). this is the fixed amount you pay each month to repay the loan. use online E-M-I calculators to understand how the interest rate, loan tenure, and loan amount affect your monthly payments. for example, a rupees ten lakh loan at eight percent interest for ten years will have a different E-M-I than a rupees five lakh loan at ten percent interest for five years."}
