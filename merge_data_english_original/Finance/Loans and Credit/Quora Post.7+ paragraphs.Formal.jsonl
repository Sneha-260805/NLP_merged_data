{"unnormalised": "Next, assess your repayment capacity. Before applying, create a realistic budget that factors in your existing EMIs and other financial obligations. Be honest about your income and expenses to determine how much you can comfortably afford to repay each month. Remember, failing to repay on time can negatively impact your credit score and incur penalties. Banks usually prefer a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of less than 40%. This ratio represents the proportion of your monthly income that goes towards debt repayments.", "normalised": "Next, assess your repayment capacity.
