{"unnormalised": "I'm 32 yrs old, living in Bangalore, and currently earning Rs. 12 lakh p.a. I'm considering both term life insurance and health insurance. For term life, I'm thinking of a sum assured of Rs. 1 crore. Is that sufficient, considering my income and liabilities? Should I look into a higher coverage, like Rs. 1.5 crore? Also, I keep seeing ads for ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans). Are those worth considering or should I stick with separate term and investment options? I understand ULIPs combine insurance with investment, but are the returns competitive compared to, say, mutual funds?", "normalised": "I'm thirty two years old, living in Bangalore, and currently earning rupee twelve lakh per annum.

{"unnormalised": "For health insurance, I'm debating between individual and family floater plans. My parents, who are 65 and 62 yrs old, live with me. Individual plans for them seem quite expensive, approx. Rs. 40,000 p.a. each. A family floater with a sum insured of Rs. 10 lakh sounds more economical, but I'm worried it might not be enough if there's a major medical event affecting multiple family members.

{"unnormalised": "I've also been reading about different types of health insurance policies, like critical illness insurance and top-up plans. Are these necessary? A critical illness policy covering conditions like cancer and heart attack seems like a good idea, but the premiums are quite high. A top-up plan, on the other hand, seems more affordable. Does a top-up plan really offer adequate coverage, or is it just a gimmick?", "normalised": "I've also been reading about different types of health insurance policies, like critical illness insurance and top-up plans.
