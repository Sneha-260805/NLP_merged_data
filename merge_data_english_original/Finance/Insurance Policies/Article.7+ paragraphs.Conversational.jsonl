{"unnormalised": "First things first: What *is* insurance? It's essentially a safety net. You pay a certain amount, called a premium, regularly (maybe monthly, quarterly, or annually) to an insurance company. In return, they promise to cover specific financial losses you might face due to unforeseen circumstances, like accidents, illnesses, or even damage to your property. Think of it like paying Rs. 5000 per month to protect yourself from potential expenses of Rs. 5,00,000. Sounds like a good deal, *na*?", "normalised": "First things first: What is insurance?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk types. There's life insurance, which protects your family financially if something happens to you. Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period, say 20 years. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, provides coverage for your entire life. Then you have health insurance, which covers medical expenses. Think of policies like Star Health Comprehensive or Max Bupa Health Companion. These are vital these days given hospital bills easily shoot up to Rs. 2 lakhs. Auto insurance covers your vehicle against damages or theft. A comprehensive policy, costing around Rs. 10,000 a year, is your best bet to avoid *tension* later. And there's even home insurance to protect your house from fire, theft, or natural disasters. The premium for that might be around Rs. 2000 pa for decent coverage.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk types.

{"unnormalised": "But here’s the *asli* point: don't just blindly buy any policy. Do your homework! Compare different policies from different companies. Look at the coverage amount, the premium, and the claim settlement ratio (how often the company actually pays out claims).
