{"unnormalised": "First, let’s break down the two main types: life insurance and general insurance. Life insurance, as the name suggests, provides financial protection to your family in the event of your untimely demise. Policies like term insurance, whole life insurance, and ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans) fall under this category. Term insurance offers a high sum assured at a relatively low premium for a specific period, say 30 years. For example, a 30-year-old might get a cover of Rs. 1 crore for an annual premium of Rs. 10,000. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, provides coverage for your entire life, typically up to age 99 or 100.", "normalised": "First, let's break down the two main types: life insurance and general insurance.

Policies like term insurance, whole life insurance, and U-L-I-Ps (Unit Linked Insurance Plans) fall under this category. Term insurance offers a high sum assured at a relatively low premium for a specific period, say thirty years.

A portion of your premium is invested in market-linked funds, giving you the potential for higher returns, but also exposing you to market risks. Then we have endowment policies, a less risky alternative that offers a maturity benefit along with a life cover. Do remember to read the policy document carefully; particularly the fine print on surrender charges and other applicable fees.", "normalised": "U-L-I-Ps combine insurance coverage with investment opportunities.
