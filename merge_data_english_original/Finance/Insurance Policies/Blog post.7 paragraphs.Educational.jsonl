{"unnormalised": "Firstly, it's crucial to differentiate between the types of policies available. There's life insurance, health insurance, motor insurance, home insurance, and travel insurance, to name a few. Life insurance provides financial security to your dependents in the event of your demise. Health insurance covers medical expenses, shielding you from the burden of hefty hospital bills. A typical health insurance policy might cover expenses up to ₹5,00,000 for a family of four. Motor insurance is mandatory for all vehicles plying on Indian roads, as per the Motor Vehicles Act.", "normalised": "Firstly, it is crucial to differentiate between the types of policies available.

{"unnormalised": "Let's delve a bit deeper into life insurance. You'll encounter terms like \"term life insurance\" and \"endowment policies.\" Term life insurance offers coverage for a specific period, say 20 yrs, at a relatively lower premium. Endowment policies, on the other hand, combine insurance coverage with a savings component. The premium might be higher, but you receive a lump sum at the end of the policy term, even if no unfortunate event occurs. Consider investing in term insurance with a coverage of at least 10x your annual income.", "normalised": "Let us delve a bit deeper into life insurance.

Look for policies that offer comprehensive coverage, including pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, day-care procedures, and even ambulance charges. Some policies also offer coverage for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period, typically 48 months. A good health insurance policy should ideally cover expenses up to Rs. 10,00,000 for a family.", "normalised": "Health insurance is equally vital, especially given the rising healthcare costs.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding the fine print is paramount. Pay close attention to exclusions, which are situations or conditions not covered by the policy. For instance, most health insurance policies exclude cosmetic surgeries. Also, be aware of the \"waiting period,\" which is the time you need to wait before certain benefits kick in. Carefully examine the policy wording, looking for clauses mentioning sub-limits on room rent (e.g., capped at ₹5000/day).", "normalised": "Understanding the fine print is paramount.
