They all sound important, but make absolutely zero sense. My agent keeps saying “premium this, coverage that,” and my brain just goes straight to imagining winning the lottery. Which, let’s be real, is more likely than me understanding the fine print. Saw one that promised coverage up to ₹1 crore! Sounds amazing, but what does that even MEAN?", "normalised": "Okay guys, need some serious advice.

{"unnormalised": "So, I’m looking at 2 options: \"Jeevan Anand\" from LIC (heard its like the OG insurance, been around since my dad’s time) and some fancy \"FutureSecure Plan\" from HDFC Life. Jeevan Anand apparently gives me some returns after like, 25 yrs, and the HDFC one claims to double my money if I invest a lump sum of Rs 5 lakhs over 10 yrs! Is it legit? Or am I about to get bamboozled? Seriously considering just sticking the money under my mattress.", "normalised": "So, I’m looking at two options: \"Jeevan Anand\" from L-I-C (heard its like the original insurance, been around since my dad’s time) and some fancy \"FutureSecure Plan\" from H-D-F-C Life.

Also, side question: Does insurance cover existential dread from reading insurance documents? Because I'm pretty sure I need that coverage more than anything else right now. Thanks in advance, and may your premiums always be low and your returns always be high! 🙏", "normalised": "Help a brother out. Any insurance gurus in the house who can E-L-I-five this whole shebang?
