Last year, around Diwali time (20/10/2023, to be exact), I finally decided to get serious about life insurance. I mean, I'm 35 yrs old, working in IT, and figured it was time to stop procrastinating.

{"unnormalised": "I stumbled upon this ULIP policy. Looked decent. The agent (Sharma ji from Max Life) explained the benefits. He emphasized how it combined insurance and investment, potentially giving better returns than just a standard term policy. It was a 20-yr policy, and the premium was Rs. 15,000 per month. Seemed a bit steep, but he convinced me it was a worthwhile investment for long-term growth.", "normalised": "I stumbled upon this U-L-I-P policy. Looked decent.

{"unnormalised": "The issue? The paperwork. Turns out, there were some discrepancies in my application form – a typo in my mother’s name and an incorrect address (12A, instead of 12/A).

They even sent a notice under Section 45 of the Insurance Act, threatening to reject the claim.", "normalised": "The issue? The paperwork.
