{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit India, seeking some clarity on insurance policies. I've been doing some research, and frankly, I'm overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. Thinking specifically about life insurance, I see terms like \"term life,\" \"ULIP,\" and \"endowment policy\" being thrown around. What are the real differences? I'm 32, married, with a kid, and need to secure my family’s future if something happens to me. My main aim is to provide for my family in case of my death and maybe save taxes under 80C of Income Tax Act, 1961. Is Rs. 1 crore enough? Or should I consider a higher amount?", "normalised": "Hey Reddit India, seeking some clarity on insurance policies.

{"unnormalised": "The online calculators and comparison sites are helpful to a point, but they often don't factor in individual circumstances. I tried using Policybazaar and Paisabazaar, but I am getting a lot of calls and emails so I am looking to cut this noise. Is there a genuinely unbiased way to compare insurance policies in India? I'd rather be adequately covered than save a few ₹1000 in premiums only to realize the coverage is insufficient.", "normalised": "The online calculators and comparison sites are helpful to a point, but they often do not factor in individual circumstances.
