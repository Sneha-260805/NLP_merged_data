{"unnormalised": "Navigating the insurance jungle in India can feel like trying to find your way through a Mumbai local during rush hour. You're pushed, pulled, and end up wondering if you've even reached your destination! We're bombarded with options: LIC, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz… the list goes on longer than my uncle’s list of Bollywood movies he's seen. And don't even get me started on the jargon! Premiums, sum assured, riders… it all sounds like code from a spy movie, doesn’t it? Honestly, sometimes I feel like I need a translator just to understand what I'm signing up for.", "normalised": "Navigating the insurance jungle in India can feel like trying to find your way through a Mumbai local during rush hour.

{"unnormalised": "One time, I decided to be a responsible adult and get myself some health insurance. I spent hours comparing policies, convinced I was becoming an insurance whiz. I finally picked one that seemed perfect, ticked all the boxes. Fast forward six months, I landed in the hospital with a bad case of Delhi Belly. Imagine my surprise when I discovered the policy didn't cover \"pre-existing conditions\" – apparently, my love for spicy street food pre-dated the insurance policy. Lesson learned: read the fine print, even if it’s smaller than the print on a medicine bottle! And maybe, just maybe, lay off the golgappas for a while (nah, who am I kidding?). My policy number was XY12345678, by the way.", "normalised": "One time, I decided to be a responsible adult and get myself some health insurance.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole \"nominee\" thing. My grandfather, being the practical man he was, nominated his prize-winning goat, Bakri, as his beneficiary. Try explaining that to the insurance company! Turns out, they are quite particular about nominees being actual humans. He tried to argue that Bakri was practically family, but to no avail. Though, to his credit, he did attempt to get Bakri an Aadhar card, which was a sight to behold. Seriously though, think about who you want to nominate. Maybe not a goat, no matter how beloved.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole \"nominee\" thing.

{"unnormalised": "The truth is, insurance policies are like jalebis – sweet, but a little twisted and hard to fully unravel. Take, for example, the Jeevan Anand policy I was offered, promising returns after 20 years. Twenty years! That's practically a lifetime in internet years. By then, we'll probably be teleporting to Mars, and I'll be trying to claim my payout from a robot. The agent told me my yearly premium would be approx. Rs 15000.", "normalised": "The truth is, insurance policies are like jalebis – sweet, but a little twisted and hard to fully unravel.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, while insurance can be a confusing beast, it's a necessary evil, like traffic in Bangalore or having to explain cricket rules to foreigners. So, do your research, read the fine print, and maybe, just maybe, consult a professional before you nominate your pet. Oh, and remember to pay your premiums on time, or you might end up with a policy that's about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. My suggestion is check out PolicyBazaar or similar websites to compare before buying any policy.", "normalised": "Ultimately, while insurance can be a confusing beast, it's a necessary evil, like traffic in Bangalore or having to explain cricket rules to foreigners.
