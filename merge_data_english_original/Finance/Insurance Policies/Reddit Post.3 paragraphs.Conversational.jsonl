{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about insurance. I'm thinking of finally getting some life insurance, and frankly, I'm super confused. There are so many policies out there - ULIPs, term plans, endowment policies... it's all Greek to me! I keep seeing ads for HDFC Life Sanchay Plus and ICICI Pru iProtect Smart, but I have no clue which one (if either!) is right for me. Has anyone had good or bad experiences with these or other insurance companies in India? My budget is around Rs. 10,000 per year.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about insurance.

I'm also considering a health insurance policy, maybe Star Health or Max Bupa, but one thing at a time, right? I read somewhere that you can claim tax benefits under Section 80C for insurance premiums up to Rs. 1.5 lakh. Is this true for all types of life insurance? I'm also a bit worried about the claim settlement ratio - I heard some companies can be real pains to deal with when you actually need to make a claim.", "normalised": "My main goal is to secure my family’s future, especially since I’m the primary breadwinner.
