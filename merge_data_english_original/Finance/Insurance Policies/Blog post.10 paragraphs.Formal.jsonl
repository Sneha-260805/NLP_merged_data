{"unnormalised": "Several factors warrant careful consideration when selecting an insurance policy. The first, and perhaps most crucial, is the individual's specific needs and risk profile. A young, healthy individual with no dependents may require a different type and level of coverage compared to a family with young children and significant financial liabilities. Secondly, the terms and conditions of the policy should be thoroughly reviewed. This includes understanding the policy's coverage scope, exclusions, waiting periods, and claim settlement process. A policy with ambiguous or restrictive terms may not provide adequate protection when needed most. Thirdly, the insurer's claim settlement ratio and customer service reputation should be evaluated. A high claim settlement ratio indicates the insurer's ability to promptly and efficiently process claims, while positive customer service reviews reflect the insurer's commitment to customer satisfaction.", "normalised": "Several factors warrant careful consideration when selecting an insurance policy.
