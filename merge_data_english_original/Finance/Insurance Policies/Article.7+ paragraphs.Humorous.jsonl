{"unnormalised": "So, you’re thinking about insurance, huh? Welcome to the club! Or should I say, welcome to the jungle? A dense, confusing, jargon-filled jungle where the only animals you'll find are actuaries and the occasional pushy salesperson trying to sell you a policy that probably covers everything except what you actually *need*. But fear not, dear reader! This article is your machete, your intrepid guide through the bewildering world of insurance policies in India. Think of me as your Sherpa, except instead of mountains, we're climbing mountains of paperwork. And instead of yaks, we have grumpy LIC agents.", "normalised": "So, you’re thinking about insurance, huh? Welcome to the club! Or should I say, welcome to the jungle?

{"unnormalised": "First things first, let's talk about the types of insurance. You've got your life insurance, which, let’s be honest, is slightly morbid. Basically, you’re betting against yourself. If you win (by dying), your family gets a payout. If you lose (by living a long, happy life), the insurance company wins. Kind of a weird game, if you ask me. Then there’s health insurance, which is crucial because Indian hospitals now charge you extra if you even *think* about getting sick. A simple fever can cost you Rs. 5000 these days! Getting a heart attack? Better have a policy with a coverage of Rs. 10 lakh at least. Don't even get me started on pre-existing conditions; they’re like the Voldemort of insurance – everyone knows they exist, but no one dares to speak their name directly.", "normalised": "First things first, let's talk about the types of insurance.

{"unnormalised": "Next up is car insurance. Ah, car insurance, the bane of every Indian driver’s existence. Getting into a fender-bender with an auto-rickshaw is practically a national pastime, and without insurance, you're looking at a repair bill that could rival the cost of a small wedding. The IDV (Insured Declared Value) is a figure that always seems magically lower than what your car is actually worth, conveniently saving the insurance company some money. Don't forget those add-ons – engine protection, zero depreciation. They sound fancy, but are they actually worth the extra Rs. 2000? Only your mechanic knows for sure.", "normalised": "Next up is car insurance. Ah, car insurance, the bane of every Indian driver’s existence.

{"unnormalised": "Home insurance is another essential, especially if you live in Mumbai during the monsoon. Forget about waterlogging; you might as well be living in a swimming pool. A broken pipe can set you back by Rs. 15000. And don't even think about what happens if your neighbor's kid accidentally sets off a Diwali firecracker on your balcony. Plus, with earthquakes becoming more frequent (thanks, climate change!), you might as well insure your house against seismic activity, too. It's better to be safe than sorry, even if it means paying another Rs. 1000 annually.", "normalised": "Home insurance is another essential, especially if you live in Mumbai during the monsoon.

{"unnormalised": "Now, for the fine print. This is where insurance companies really show their creative side. Exclusions, clauses, sub-clauses – they’re all designed to make you question your life choices and the very fabric of reality. You might think you're covered for everything, but read the policy document closely. You'll probably find that you're not covered for anything involving Tuesdays, left-handed people, or the migration of swallows. Pro-tip: Hire a lawyer to decipher it. Or, better yet, just set your money on fire. It's probably less stressful.", "normalised": "Now, for the fine print. This is where insurance companies really show their creative side.

{"unnormalised": "Claiming your insurance? Oh, that's a whole other circus. Be prepared to jump through hoops, fill out forms in triplicate, and patiently explain your situation to a claims adjuster who seems to be actively trying to find reasons to deny your claim. \"Sir, your policy doesn't cover damage caused by flying cows,\" they might say, even if you live in a city. Keep all your documents organized, be polite (but firm), and maybe bribe someone with chai. It's the Indian way.", "normalised": "Claiming your insurance? Oh, that's a whole other circus.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, insurance is a necessary evil. It's like paying a protection racket for your own peace of mind. But with a little bit of humor, a healthy dose of skepticism, and a willingness to wade through the jargon, you can navigate the insurance jungle and emerge relatively unscathed. Just remember: read the fine print, compare policies, and never trust an insurance agent who offers you free mithai. They’re probably hiding something. And always, ALWAYS, prepone your renewal date by at least a week. Trust me on this one.", "normalised": "Ultimately, insurance is a necessary evil.
