{"unnormalised": "First off, there's term insurance. I've heard mixed things, but the general consensus seems to be that it's crucial. I saw a policy from HDFC Life offering coverage of Rs. 1 crore for a relatively low premium. Is this something I should seriously consider? What are the key things to look for when comparing term insurance plans from different companies like LIC vs. ICICI Prudential? Are there any hidden clauses I should be aware of, or are there better options?", "normalised": "First off, there's term insurance.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are health insurance policies. With rising medical costs, this seems non-negotiable. I am looking for a good health insurance, with a coverage of Rs 5,00,000. I am confused whether I should opt for a family floater or an individual policy. I am healthy right now (touchwood!), so how much premium is justifiable? My dad had a bypass surgery last year and it set us back by ₹4 lakh despite having some coverage. Any recommendations for reliable insurers with good claim settlement ratios and cashless facilities at major hospitals like Narayana Health or Apollo?", "normalised": "Then there are health insurance policies.
