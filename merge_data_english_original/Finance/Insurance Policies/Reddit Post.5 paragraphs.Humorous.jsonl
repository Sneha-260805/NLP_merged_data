{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some advice before I drown in paperwork! I'm looking at insurance policies and honestly, my head is spinning faster than an auto-rickshaw driver avoiding potholes on a Mumbai street. Seriously, is \"investment-linked insurance\" even insurance? Seems more like a complicated scheme to part me from my hard-earned rupees. My agent, Mr. Sharma, keeps saying it's the \"best of both worlds,\" but all I see are fees and fine print. Is it just me, or does everyone feel like they need a PhD in finance to understand this stuff?", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some advice before I drown in paperwork!

{"unnormalised": "So, I'm considering a simple term life insurance policy. Less exciting than a Bollywood dance number, I know, but maybe safer? I’m 35 yrs old and the premiums seem reasonable. They say it’ll cover my family for Rs. 1 Crore if I, you know, kick the bucket. Morbid, but gotta think about these things, right? Still, I'm seeing jargon like \"riders\" and \"nominees\" and \"surrender value\" plastered all over the brochure. Does anyone actually read all this stuff? I usually just skip straight to the price, like when I'm buying jalebis.", "normalised": "So, I am considering a simple term life insurance policy.

{"unnormalised": "My biggest concern is whether I'm getting a good deal. PolicyBazaar throws up approximately 500 different options with varying premiums and coverage. How do I even compare them? Is there a magical formula, like calculating the perfect chai-to-milk ratio? Also, what's the deal with claiming the insurance? Will my family actually receive the money, or will they be stuck fighting with the insurance company for months like in those old TV serials?", "normalised": "My biggest concern is whether I am getting a good deal.

{"unnormalised": "And then there are the \"tax benefits.\" Mr. Sharma keeps emphasizing that I can save on my income tax under section 80C. Sounds good, but I’m always skeptical of anything the government offers. It usually comes with a catch, like having to file 17 different forms and bribe 3 babus. So, real talk, are the tax benefits actually worth the hassle, or am I better off just investing in something simpler, like gold biscuits?", "normalised": "And then there are the \"tax benefits.\" Mister Sharma keeps emphasizing that I can save on my income tax under section eighty C.
