It covers you for a specific period – say, 20 years – and if something happens during that time, your family gets a payout. Then there's whole life insurance, which covers you for your entire life and also builds up a cash value over time. Bit more complicated, right?

Check out policies from companies like ICICI Lombard or Apollo Munich; they usually have decent coverage. Check if they cover you for about 5 lakhs or even 10 lakhs.
