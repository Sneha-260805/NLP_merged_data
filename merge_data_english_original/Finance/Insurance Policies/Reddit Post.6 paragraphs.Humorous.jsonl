{"unnormalised": "First, there's the terminology. ULIPs, term plans, endowment policies... it's like alphabet soup for grown-ups! I spent a good 2 hours just trying to figure out what \"Sum Assured\" actually meant. And then there were the agents. Oh, the agents! Each one promised me the moon if I just signed on the dotted line. One guy, Mr. Sharma from ICICI Pru, practically promised me early retirement if I invested in his \"guaranteed return\" plan. Guaranteed return? As if the stock market listens to guarantees!", "normalised": "First, there's the terminology. U-L-I-P-s, term plans, endowment policies... it's like alphabet soup for grown-ups!
