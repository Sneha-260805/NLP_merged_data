{"unnormalised": "Let’s start with life insurance. Think of it as securing your family's future, especially if you're the breadwinner. If something happens to you, they get a lump sum. Term life is usually the cheapest - a large payout for a specific time. For example, my friend bought a term policy for ₹1 crore for 20 years, costing him about Rs. 10,000/year. Whole life is pricier but covers you your entire life and has a cash value component.", "normalised": "Let’s start with life insurance.

Medical bills can bankrupt you faster than you can say \"Aadhar card.\" Look for policies that cover pre-existing conditions after a waiting period and have a good claim settlement ratio.

{"unnormalised": "Car insurance is mandatory, as you know, thanks to the Motor Vehicles Act. But don't just go for the cheapest policy. Make sure it covers third-party liability AND own damage. A comprehensive policy is best, even if it costs a little more. Plus, check the IDV (Insured Declared Value) – that's how much the insurer will pay if your car is totaled.
