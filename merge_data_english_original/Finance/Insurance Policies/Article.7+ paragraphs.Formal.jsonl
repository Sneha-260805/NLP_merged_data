However, a significant challenge faced by both insurers and policyholders is the lapse of insurance policies.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to policy lapses in India. Financial constraints, particularly among lower-income groups, often force policyholders to prioritize immediate needs over long-term financial planning. The complexity of insurance products, coupled with a lack of financial literacy, can also lead to misunderstanding of policy terms and obligations. For instance, many policyholders may not be fully aware of the implications of missing premium payments or the availability of revival options. In addition, changes in life circumstances, such as job loss or relocation, can disrupt premium payment schedules. Data from IRDAI indicates that approximately 20% of life insurance policies lapse within the first 3 years.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to policy lapses in India.

{"unnormalised": "The consequences of policy lapses are multifaceted. Policyholders lose the protection and benefits associated with the insurance cover, potentially exposing them and their families to financial hardship in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Insurers, on the other hand, incur losses due to the forfeiture of premium income and the administrative costs associated with policy issuance and management. The high lapse rate also undermines the overall credibility and trustworthiness of the insurance sector, discouraging potential customers from investing in insurance products. Furthermore, lapsed policies can negatively impact the insurer's persistency ratio, a key performance indicator used by regulatory bodies and investors.", "normalised": "The consequences of policy lapses are multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Addressing the issue of policy lapses requires a multi-pronged approach involving insurers, regulators, and policyholders. Insurers need to develop more customer-centric products and services that cater to the diverse needs and financial capabilities of the Indian population. This includes offering flexible premium payment options, such as monthly or quarterly installments, and providing clear and concise information about policy terms and benefits in regional languages. Furthermore, insurers should proactively engage with policyholders to remind them of upcoming premium due dates and offer assistance in managing their policies.", "normalised": "Addressing the issue of policy lapses requires a multi-pronged approach involving insurers, regulators, and policyholders.

IRDAI should continue to conduct public awareness campaigns to educate individuals about the importance of insurance and the consequences of policy lapses.
