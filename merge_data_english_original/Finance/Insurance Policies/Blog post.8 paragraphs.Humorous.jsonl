{"unnormalised": "First up, life insurance. It’s basically betting against yourself. Morbid? Maybe. Smart? Definitely. Imagine, after years of yelling at the TV during cricket matches, you finally kick the bucket (hopefully not *because* of a cricket match, though). Your family gets a sweet payout. Consider it a \"sorry I left you with my questionable Bollywood opinions\" fund. Policies range from ₹5 lakh to ₹5 Cr, depending on how dramatic your send-off needs to be.", "normalised": "First up, life insurance. It's basically betting against yourself. Morbid? Maybe. Smart?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's health insurance. Because, let's face it, the only thing predictable about your health is that it's going to throw you a curveball at the most inconvenient time. Like right before Diwali. Suddenly, appendicitis! The cost of treatment at Apollo Hospitals starts at around Rs. 50,000, but trust me, having insurance makes that bill a *lot* less painful than the actual surgery.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s not forget motor insurance. Because navigating Indian roads is basically an extreme sport. You're dodging cows, auto-rickshaws seemingly piloted by kamikaze pigeons, and that one uncle who thinks indicators are purely decorative.

{"unnormalised": "Travel insurance, folks. Essential. Especially if you're the kind who thinks \"adventure\" involves eating street food from questionable vendors.
