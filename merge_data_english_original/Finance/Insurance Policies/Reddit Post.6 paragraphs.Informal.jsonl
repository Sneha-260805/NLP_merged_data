Are ULIPs even worth it?", "normalised": "The thing is, I'm seeing so many different types: term life, U-L-I-Ps, health insurance, etcetera. It's all Greek to me!

Budget-wise, I'm thinking of spending around Rs. 2000-3000 per month on insurance premiums, but I'm flexible if it's really worth it. Any advice or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated!
