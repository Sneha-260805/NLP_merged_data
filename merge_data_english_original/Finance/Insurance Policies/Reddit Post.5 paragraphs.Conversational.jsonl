I’m 28 yrs old, living in Bangalore, and frankly, all the options are kinda overwhelming. There's LIC Jeevan Anand, HDFC Life Click 2 Protect, and a bunch of others. My dad keeps telling me to just go with LIC, because \"it's GOI approved, beta!\" But are the private ones really that bad?", "normalised": "Okay, so I was thinking about getting a life insurance policy, you know, just to be responsible and all.

{"unnormalised": "I’ve been reading up on term insurance vs. endowment plans. Seems like term insurance is the way to go if you just want the death benefit. But endowment plans have that maturity benefit thing going on, which sounds nice for, like, retirement planning maybe? I’m so confused! Also, what's the deal with all the riders they offer? Accidental death benefit, critical illness rider… It all adds up, you know? Costs are showing at Rs 12,000 per year on Policybazaar for a term insurance of Rs 1 Crore.", "normalised": "I've been reading up on term insurance versus endowment plans.

That’s like my biggest fear. Anyone had experience with claiming on life insurance policies, especially from Bajaj Allianz or ICICI Prudential? What documents did they ask for and how long did it take to get the money? I want to make sure my family in Kolkata is secure.", "normalised": "I'm also a bit wary of the claim settlement ratio.

One place, the premium amount for a max life insurance shows at ₹8,500 PA while another the same plan costs ₹9,200 PA. Some are cheaper, some are more expensive, but are they actually better?
