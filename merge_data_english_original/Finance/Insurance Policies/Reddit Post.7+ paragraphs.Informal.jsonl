{"unnormalised": "My main concern is health insurance, tbh. Heard too many horror stories of friends getting slapped with bills running into lakhs after a dengue fever scare or something. My company insurance is decent-ish, but only covers me, not my parents. My dad's 60, and Mom's 55, so getting them covered feels like a priority. Any suggestions on good family floater plans? Should I look at individual policies instead? What's the deal with pre-existing conditions? My mom has BP, nothing major, but still…", "normalised": "My main concern is health insurance, to be honest.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole life insurance thing. I keep seeing ads for term insurance, ULIPs, endowment policies… it’s like alphabet soup! Term insurance seems straightforward enough – cheap coverage in case I, you know, kick the bucket. ULIPs, on the other hand, seem like a risky combo of insurance and investment. Are they worth it, or am I better off investing separately in mutual funds or something? I'm open to taking some risk, but I don't want to gamble away my savings. I can probably spare ₹10,000 - ₹15,000 a month across all insurance things.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole life insurance thing.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about critical illness insurance? I’ve read it covers things like heart attacks, cancer, and other scary stuff. Is it redundant if I already have health insurance, or is it a good idea to have both? I’m trying to compare policies on Policybazaar, but honestly, the sheer volume of information is overwhelming. Plus, all those “limited-time offers” and “special discounts” feel kinda scammy, you know? It's always \"act now before 30/11/2024!\"", "normalised": "Also, what about critical illness insurance?

{"unnormalised": "And another thing - I'm a bit confused about tax benefits. I know insurance premiums are tax-deductible under Section 80C, but what are the limits? Is it ₹1.5 lakh per year?
