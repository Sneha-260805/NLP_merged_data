I even bragged to my mom about how I hadn't visited a bank branch in, like, forever. Famous last words, I tell you! It all started innocently enough, with a message from \"SBI\" on 02/11/2023 about updating my KYC. I clicked on the link (yes, I know, huge mistake!), and bam! It asked for my net banking login ID and password.", "normalised": "So, I thought I was all cool and tech-savvy, right? Paperless statements, U-P-I payments, the whole nine yards.

{"unnormalised": "The police inspector, a surprisingly tech-savvy guy named Sharma, explained that these scammers are incredibly sophisticated. They use spoofed numbers that mimic bank numbers.
