I've been with ICICI Bank since, like, forever (since 2005 maybe?), and honestly, their service has gone downhill. Plus, their interest rates on savings accounts are a joke - like 3.5% p.a.!

{"unnormalised": "So, I'm looking for a bank with better rates, maybe something closer to 6% or even 7%, if that's possible these days. Also, decent customer service is a MUST.
