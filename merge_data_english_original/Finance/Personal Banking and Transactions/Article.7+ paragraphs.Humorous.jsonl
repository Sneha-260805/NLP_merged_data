You see entries like \"NEFT transfer: Rs. 2500 to Priya Sharma,\" and wonder, \"Who *is* Priya Sharma, and why am I funding her chai habit?\" The key is to decode these financial hieroglyphics. Think of it as a game – a very serious game where the stakes are your hard-earned ₹.

Let's just say he was pleasantly surprised, and I spent the next week eating Maggi noodles to recover. Double-check, triple-check, and maybe even ask your grandma to supervise before hitting that \"submit\" button. Also, those OTPs (One-Time Passwords) are your financial bodyguards. Guard them with your life (or at least more closely than your Netflix password).", "normalised": "Then there's the online banking experience.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of balance, keeping track is crucial. I personally use a sophisticated system involving a crumpled notebook, a rusty calculator, and a healthy dose of wishful thinking. There are apps for that, of course, but where's the fun in letting technology handle everything? Pro-tip: round up your expenses. That Rs. 20 chai every day? Let's just call it Rs. 50.

{"unnormalised": "Let's not forget about fixed deposits (FDs). Think of them as your money going on a silent retreat – it sits quietly in a corner, accumulating interest while you go about your daily life.

Better than letting inflation eat away at your savings like a pack of hungry wolves.
