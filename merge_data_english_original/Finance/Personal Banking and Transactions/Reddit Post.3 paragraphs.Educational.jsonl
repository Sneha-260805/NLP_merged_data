{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about online banking in India. I’m trying to understand all the different charges and fees, especially when transferring money. My SBI account seems to be deducting Rs. 5 + GST for every UPI transaction over a certain limit (I think it’s after 20 transactions?). Is this normal? Also, what's the deal with NEFT and RTGS? I know RTGS is faster, but is it always worth the extra charge? Does it depend on the amount transferred? I'm usually transferring sums like Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 25,000.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, quick question about online banking in India.

{"unnormalised": "It seems like there are so many ways to transfer money now - UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS. It can be confusing to figure out the best and cheapest option. My friend told me that some private banks like HDFC or ICICI have different charges. Can anyone share their experiences and compare the fees for different transaction methods? Is there a website that clearly compares all the bank charges? I'd like to avoid paying unnecessary fees. Plus, I heard something about transaction limits of Rs. 2 lakh or more requiring extra verification.", "normalised": "It seems like there are so many ways to transfer money now - U-P-I, I-M-P-S, N-E-F-T, R-T-G-S.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, is there anything I can do to minimize these bank charges for everyday transactions? Are there specific types of accounts or credit cards that waive these fees? I'm mostly dealing with transferring money within India, but sometimes I have to send money to my cousin studying in the UK (around £500), so international transfer fees are also a consideration. Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!", "normalised": "Finally, is there anything I can do to minimize these bank charges for everyday transactions?
