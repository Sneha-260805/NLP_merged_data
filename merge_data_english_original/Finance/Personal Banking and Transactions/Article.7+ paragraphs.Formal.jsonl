{"unnormalised": "With the rise of digital banking, traditional methods of conducting financial transactions are gradually being replaced by online platforms. Services like UPI (Unified Payments Interface) have revolutionized the way Indians transfer money, with transactions frequently seen in amounts as small as ₹10 at local chai stalls. This surge in digital payments has also led to an increase in the usage of mobile wallets and net banking facilities offered by institutions like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC Bank. Customers are now able to perform tasks like NEFT and RTGS transfers with ease, often from the comfort of their homes.", "normalised": "With the rise of digital banking, traditional methods of conducting financial transactions are gradually being replaced by online platforms.

{"unnormalised": "However, this rapid digitalization also presents challenges. Data security remains a primary concern, with instances of online fraud and phishing attacks on the rise. The proliferation of unnormalized data, such as account numbers entered without proper formatting or incomplete transaction details, can further exacerbate these vulnerabilities. A customer, for example, might enter their account number as \"12345678901\" instead of \"1234-5678-901\". Such inconsistencies make it difficult to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.", "normalised": "However, this rapid digitalization also presents challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the diverse nature of financial data requires robust normalization processes. Consider, for instance, the various ways in which amounts can be expressed: \"Rs. 500\", \"₹500.00\", \"INR500\", \"Five Hundred Rupees Only\". These variations, while understandable in a conversational context, pose significant challenges for automated data processing and analysis. Banks operating on outdated systems often struggle to reconcile these differences, leading to delays in transaction processing and inaccurate reporting.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the diverse nature of financial data requires robust normalization processes.

{"unnormalised": "The need for data normalization extends beyond fraud prevention and operational efficiency. Regulatory compliance, particularly with mandates from the RBI (Reserve Bank of India), necessitates accurate and consistent financial data. Banks are required to report on various metrics, including transaction volumes, loan disbursements, and deposit levels. Inconsistent data formats can hinder these reporting efforts, potentially leading to non-compliance and penalties.", "normalised": "The need for data normalization extends beyond fraud prevention and operational efficiency.
