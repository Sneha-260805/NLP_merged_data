So, I am finally trying to get my finances in order (I know, I know, about time!). I have been with S-B-I for ages, basically since my parents opened a joint account for me way back when. I want to understand if I should switch to a newer private bank like H-D-F-C or I-C-I-C-I or Kotak. I know there are pros and cons with nationalized banks, but I do not understand what these charges are."}
