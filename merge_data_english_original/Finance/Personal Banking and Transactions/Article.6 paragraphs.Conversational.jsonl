{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk accounts. Most of us have a savings a/c, and maybe even a current a/c if we're running a small business. But are you really maximizing what your bank offers? Take a look at the interest rates. Is SBI giving you a better deal than HDFC? Don't be afraid to shop around! Also, think about linking your Aadhaar to your bank account.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, personal banking is all about being informed and proactive. Don't just let your money sit in a low-interest account. Explore options like fixed deposits (FDs) or recurring deposits (RDs). Talk to your bank manager about investment options that suit your risk tolerance.
