{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice on personal banking in India. I’m a student, and I’m trying to figure out the best way to manage my money. Right now, I mostly use Paytm for small transactions, like chai and auto-rickshaw rides, but I'm thinking of opening a proper bank account. Any recommendations for banks that are good for students, with low minimum balance requirements and decent online banking? I heard SBI and HDFC are popular, but what are your thoughts? Any insights on transaction limits for UPI and net banking?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice on personal banking in India.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, any tips for tracking expenses and budgeting? I'm terrible at keeping track of where my money goes. Are there any good apps or tools you'd recommend for someone who's just starting out with personal finance? Maybe something that can automatically track my transactions and categorize them. I’m also curious if anyone uses digital gold as investment via apps like Groww... is it actually worth it or just a fad?
