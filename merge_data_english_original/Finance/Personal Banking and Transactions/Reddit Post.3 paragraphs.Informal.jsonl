I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to this, but I recently got a salary hike to ₹45,000 per month (CTC) and I wanna start being more responsible. My current bank is ICICI, but I'm thinking of opening another account, maybe with HDFC or SBI. Are there any specific schemes or accounts that are good for young professionals?", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some advice on managing my finances better.

{"unnormalised": "Like, I've heard about SIPs and mutual funds, but the whole thing sounds complicated. Is it worth it to invest even with a small amount like Rs. 1000 per month? Also, any tips on tracking expenses? I usually just use Google Pay for everything, but it’s hard to keep tabs after a while. Maybe an app suggestion? I'm tired of seeing my bank balance hovering around ₹5000 after the 20th of every month!", "normalised": "Like, I've heard about S-I-P-s and mutual funds, but the whole thing sounds complicated.

Are there any safe credit cards that don't have crazy interest rates or hidden charges? He mentioned something about reward points and cashback, but I'm not sure if it's all that useful. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks, bhai log!", "normalised": "Also, my dad keeps telling me to get a credit card, but I'm worried I'll end up spending more than I earn.
