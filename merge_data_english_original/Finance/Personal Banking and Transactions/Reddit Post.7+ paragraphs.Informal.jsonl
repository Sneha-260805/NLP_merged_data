{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm trying to wrap my head around UPI transactions. I use Paytm and Google Pay mostly, you know, for quick chai payments at the local tapri and stuff. I made a transfer of Rs. 2000 to my friend Ravi last week, and the amount debited, but Ravi swears he never received it. It's been like 3 days already! Has this happened to anyone else?

But are there any actual benefits to using a credit card for everyday transactions? I heard something about reward points and cashback offers, but are they actually worth it?
