I personally download my bank statement every month-end. It’s a pain sometimes, but better safe than sorry.

{"unnormalised": "Next, understand the fees. Banks love charging fees! Minimum balance charges are a common one. For example, if your bank requires you to maintain an Avg. Monthly Balance (AMB) of, say, Rs. 5000 in your account and you fall short, they'll deduct a penalty. Also, watch out for debit card annual fees (usually around Rs. 250-500) and ATM withdrawal charges beyond the free limit. These may seem trivial individually, but they add up.", "normalised": "Next, understand the fees. Banks love charging fees! Minimum balance charges are a common one.

{"unnormalised": "Regarding fixed deposits (FDs), consider laddering. Instead of putting all your money in one FD for, say, 5 years, split it up into multiple FDs with different tenures: 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc. This way, you have some liquidity every year, and you can reinvest at potentially higher interest rates. Remember, FD interest is taxable, so factor that in.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, a word on credit cards. They can be great tools if used responsibly, but they can also lead to debt traps. Always pay your bills on time. Even a single day’s delay can attract hefty late payment fees and affect your CIBIL score. Try to pay the full amount due each month, not just the minimum. Don’t view your credit limit as free money; consider it an emergency fund. Most cards charge interest rates around 3-4% per month (or 36-48% per annum) on outstanding balances.", "normalised": "Finally, a word on credit cards.
