{"unnormalised": "First off, I'm a salaried employee in Bangalore, and my Form 16 shows a TDS deduction of ₹50,000. My annual income falls in the 30% tax bracket. Now, I've also made some investments under Section 80C - specifically, I invested ₹1.5 lakh in a PPF account. Does this mean I can claim the full 1.5 lakh as a deduction and reduce my taxable income? Is there anything else I should be considering under 80C, like maybe ELSS funds? Also, my employer didn't fully account for my HRA exemption in Form 16, so I'll have to claim it myself. I live in a rented apartment and pay Rs. 25,000 per month as rent.
