{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, hoping someone can clarify a few things about ITR filing. I'm new to all this tax stuff and feeling a bit overwhelmed. I understand the deadline is usually 31st July, but I'm a bit late this year. What are the implications if I file after 31/07/2024? Is there a penalty? And how much roughly? Also, I keep seeing terms like \"Form 16\" and \"ITR-1,\" but honestly, I have no clue what they mean or which one applies to me.

{"unnormalised": "Now, about Form 16 and ITR forms. Form 16 is a certificate your employer gives you, detailing the tax deducted at source (TDS) from your salary. ITR-1, also known as Sahaj, is generally for individuals with income from salary, one house property, and other sources like interest, up to Rs. 50 lakh. Since you said you have a salaried job, ITR-1 is likely what you'll need. Make sure you use your PAN card and Aadhaar number for verification. Hope this helps!
