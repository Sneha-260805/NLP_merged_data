{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about understanding the basics of tax filing in India, right? It might seem daunting at first, especially with all the sections and forms. But trust me, it gets easier with practice. The first thing you need is your PAN card – it's your primary ID for all things tax-related.

Also, explore other deductions like 80D for health insurance premiums. I think my total 80C deductions came up to ₹1,48,000 last year. There are different ITR forms depending on your income sources.
