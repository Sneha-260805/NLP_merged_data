You can find apartments in Whitefield starting from around Rs. 5000 per sq ft, but then in Koramangala, expect to pay upwards of Rs. 12000/sq ft. Location is key, bhai. Amenities also play a HUGE role in pricing. Think clubhouse, swimming pool, security…all that jazz.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about property rates in Bangalore recently, so I thought I’d share some insights.

Also, plot sizes matter if you are going for a house. A 30x40 site might cost you around Rs. 80 lakhs in a developing area, but a similar plot in a prime location like Jayanagar could easily be Rs. 2 crores or more. And don't forget registration charges, usually around 1% of the property value + stamp duty.", "normalised": "Then you’ve got the whole builder reputation thing.
