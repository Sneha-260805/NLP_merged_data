First, understand the area of the flat. Builders often quote the \"super built-up area\", which might be, say, one thousand two hundred square feet, but the actual usable area (carpet area) could be much less, perhaps only eight hundred square feet. Clarify what you're paying for; pay based on carpet area only if possible. The rate per square foot is key, so negotiate hard! Don't just look at the base price of, say, rupee one point five crore."}

Registration charges are extra, usually around one percent. Then there are society formation charges (rupee twenty five thousand is typical), G-S-T on under-construction properties (five percent if not an affordable housing project, one percent or Nil if affordable), and possibly parking charges (rupee five lakh for a covered spot is common). These can add a hefty sum on top of that one point five crore."}

Maintenance charges depend on the building and services offered; rupee five per square foot per month is a rough average in some areas, but could be way higher in premium buildings. And don’t forget the E-M-I on your home loan, if you're taking one. A loan of, say, rupee one crore at eight point five percent interest over twenty years means a monthly E-M-I of around rupee eighty six thousand, seven hundred and eighty two."}
