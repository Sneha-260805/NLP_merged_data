{"unnormalised": "Well, the 2021 census data, whenever it's fully released, will be crucial. As of right now, based on projections and publicly available info, we can already see some interesting trends. For example, India’s projected population in 2023 is around 1.4286 billion. That’s a BIG number! The literacy rate, according to the last complete census from 2011, was about 74.04%. We need to see how much that’s improved. These numbers are important for everything from resource allocation to planning infrastructure.", "normalised": "Well, the two thousand twenty one census data, whenever it is fully released, will be crucial. As of right now, based on projections and publicly available info, we can already see some interesting trends. For example, India’s projected population in two thousand twenty three is around one point four two eight six billion. That’s a big number! The literacy rate, according to the last complete census from two thousand eleven, was about seventy four point zero four percent. We need to see how much that’s improved. These numbers are important for everything from resource allocation to planning infrastructure."}
{"unnormalised": "One key thing to watch will be the age distribution. What percentage is under 25? What percentage is over 60? This affects workforce planning and social security needs. We also need to examine the rural vs. urban population distribution. This data impacts everything from agricultural policies to urban development projects. The census also collects data on things like access to housing, sanitation, and electricity. Knowing, for instance, that 65% of rural households have access to electricity, helps policymakers better understand the needs of the population.", "normalised": "One key thing to watch will be the age distribution.

We need to see if there has been any improvement since 2011, where some states had ratios as low as 918. Census data provides incredibly detailed insights, broken down by state, district, and even smaller units. Learning from this data means making evidence-based decisions to improve the lives of all Indians.", "normalised": "Finally, analyzing the sex ratio (females per one thousand males) is essential.
