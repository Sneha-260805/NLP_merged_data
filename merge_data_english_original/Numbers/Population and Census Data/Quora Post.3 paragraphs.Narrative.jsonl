Fast forward to the 2011 census, and we were looking at something like 1.21 billion. That’s a pretty massive jump, right? Shows the scale of demographic change in just 60 years. It’s even more interesting when you consider regional variations; states like UP and Bihar experienced much higher growth rates than, say, Kerala or Tamil Nadu.", "normalised": "Someone asked about population trends in India post independence.

According to the last available data, there were 943 females per 1000 males. While it's improved, there's still work to be done. Also, literacy rates are significantly higher than they were in 1951 at about 74.04%, but there is a gender disparity especially in rural regions.
