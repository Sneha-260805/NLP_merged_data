{"unnormalised": "According to projections, India's population is estimated to be around 1.4 billion as of 2023. That's a massive number! Previous census data from 2011 pegged the population at 1.21 billion. The decadal growth rate was around 17.7% between 2001 and 2011. Projecting this forward, the current growth rate is estimated to be around 1.1% p.a. However, these are just estimates. The actual numbers from the 2021 census will give us a clearer picture.", "normalised": "According to projections, India's population is estimated to be around one point four billion as of two thousand twenty three. That's a massive number! Previous census data from two thousand eleven pegged the population at one point two one billion. The decadal growth rate was around seventeen point seven percent between two thousand one and two thousand eleven. Projecting this forward, the current growth rate is estimated to be around one point one percent per annum. However, these are just estimates. The actual numbers from the two thousand twenty one census will give us a clearer picture."}
{"unnormalised": "Looking at state-wise data from the 2011 census, Uttar Pradesh had the highest population with approx. 200 million people. Maharashtra came in second with over 110 million. Smaller states like Sikkim have a population of just over 600,000. Understanding these regional variations is critical for resource allocation and policy making. The sex ratio in India, according to the 2011 census, was 943 females per 1000 males. While this has improved slightly since then, continued efforts are needed to address gender imbalances.", "normalised": "Looking at state-wise data from the two thousand eleven census, Uttar Pradesh had the highest population with approximately two hundred million people. Maharashtra came in second with over one hundred and ten million. Smaller states like Sikkim have a population of just over six hundred thousand.

The sex ratio in India, according to the two thousand eleven census, was nine hundred and forty three females per one thousand males.

{"unnormalised": "Literacy rates are another important metric. The 2011 census reported an overall literacy rate of 74.04%, with male literacy at 82.14% and female literacy at 65.46%. Kerala consistently tops the charts in literacy, while states like Bihar have significantly lower rates. There’s been considerable progress since, but significant disparities remain, highlighting the need for targeted educational initiatives.

From population density (e.g. 11,000+ people per sq km in Delhi) to age structure and migration patterns, these numbers are essential for informed decision-making across various sectors. We all eagerly await the finalized data so we can formulate better policies and programs.", "normalised": "The two thousand twenty one census data, once released, will provide invaluable insights into India's demographic landscape.
