{"unnormalised": "The provisional data from the 2021 Census, released recently, indicates significant demographic changes across India. The country's population stands at approx. 1.39 billion, a 17.7% increase since the 2011 Census. This decadal growth rate is, however, slightly lower than the 21.5% recorded between 2001 and 2011, suggesting a slowing down of population growth. The data also reveals a shift in the rural-urban composition with urban areas now housing 35% of the total population, up from 31.16% in 2011. States like UP and Bihar continue to be the most populous, while smaller states in the North-East show relatively lower population figures.", "normalised": "the provisional data from the two thousand twenty one census, released recently, indicates significant demographic changes across India. the country's population stands at approximately one point three nine billion, a seventeen point seven percent increase since the two thousand eleven census. this decadal growth rate is, however, slightly lower than the twenty one point five percent recorded between two thousand one and two thousand eleven, suggesting a slowing down of population growth. the data also reveals a shift in the rural or urban composition with urban areas now housing thirty five percent of the total population, up from thirty one point one six percent in two thousand eleven. states like U-P and Bihar continue to be the most populous, while smaller states in the North-East show relatively lower population figures."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the sex ratio, measured as the number of females per 1000 males, has improved marginally to 943, from 940 in the previous census. This positive trend is more pronounced in some southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the sex ratio is above 1000. However, challenges remain in states like Haryana and Punjab, where the sex ratio is significantly lower than the national average. The child sex ratio (0-6 years) continues to be a concern, with a slight decline observed in several states, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.", "normalised": "furthermore, the sex ratio, measured as the number of females per one thousand males, has improved marginally to nine hundred and forty three, from nine hundred and forty in the previous census. this positive trend is more pronounced in some southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the sex ratio is above one thousand. however, challenges remain in states like Haryana and Punjab, where the sex ratio is significantly lower than the national average. the child sex ratio (zero to six years) continues to be a concern, with a slight decline observed in several states, highlighting the need for targeted interventions."}
{"unnormalised": "Literacy rates have also seen an upward trend, with the overall literacy rate now standing at 77.78%, compared to 74.04% in 2011. Male literacy is higher at 84.7%, while female literacy is at 70.3%. While there has been progress across all states, significant disparities persist between rural and urban areas, and between different social groups. The Census data also provides insights into the distribution of different religious groups, caste groups, and languages spoken across the country, which are crucial for policy planning and resource allocation.", "normalised": "literacy rates have also seen an upward trend, with the overall literacy rate now standing at seventy seven point seven eight percent, compared to seventy four point zero four percent in two thousand eleven. male literacy is higher at eighty four point seven percent, while female literacy is at seventy point three percent. while there has been progress across all states, significant disparities persist between rural and urban areas, and between different social groups. the census data also provides insights into the distribution of different religious groups, caste groups, and languages spoken across the country, which are crucial for policy planning and resource allocation."}
{"unnormalised": "Detailed reports and state-wise data will be released in phases over the next few months. This comprehensive data will be invaluable for policymakers, researchers, and civil society organizations in understanding India's evolving demographics and addressing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. These numbers play a key role in defining policy and resource allocations for the next 10 years. For example, education and healthcare budgets are directly influenced by these numbers.", "normalised": "detailed reports and state-wise data will be released in phases over the next few months. this comprehensive data will be invaluable for policymakers, researchers, and civil society organizations in understanding India's evolving demographics and addressing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. these numbers play a key role in defining policy and resource allocations for the next ten years. for example, education and healthcare budgets are directly influenced by these numbers."}
