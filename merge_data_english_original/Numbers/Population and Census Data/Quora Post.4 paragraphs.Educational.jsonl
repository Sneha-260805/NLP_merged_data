According to the 2011 census (which is still our most reliable nationwide data), India's population was around 1.21 billion. Experts estimate it to be around 1.4 billion in 2023. The next official census was supposed to happen in 2021, but it's been delayed, so we are still using older data.", "normalised": "Someone asked about the population distribution in India, and it's quite interesting.

On the other hand, Sikkim has a very small population, around 600,000. The density also varies greatly, from 11,320 persons per sq km in Delhi to just 13 persons per sq km in Arunachal Pradesh.

As the population ages, India needs to focus on policies that support an aging workforce and healthcare needs. The child sex ratio, which was 919 females per 1000 males in the 0-6 age group in 2011, is also a crucial indicator of social development.", "normalised": "Age distribution also plays a crucial role.
