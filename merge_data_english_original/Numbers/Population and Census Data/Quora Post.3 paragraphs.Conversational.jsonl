For example, knowing the population density in cities like Mumbai helps plan infrastructure like roads, hospitals, and schools. Also, knowing the sex ratio of 940 females per 1000 males informs policies aimed at gender equality. Data points regarding the percentage of the population below the poverty line and literacy rates are also gathered. All this stuff matters for good governance, you see.", "normalised": "Now, why is understanding census data so important? It's not just about a big number.
