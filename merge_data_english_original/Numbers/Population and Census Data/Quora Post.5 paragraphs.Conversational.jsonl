{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about the challenges in collecting population data in India. It's a really interesting question. Well, first off, India is huge! We're talking 1.4 billion ppl according to the latest estimates (official 2021 Census data is still pending, but projections show it's well past that mark). That's a lot of doors to knock on, even if each enumerator covers just 1000 households.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about the challenges in collecting population data in India.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the diversity. Think about it - every state has its own languages, dialects, and cultural nuances. Forms need to be translated into multiple languages, and enumerators need to be trained to handle different cultural sensitivities. You can't just use the same approach in, say, Kerala as you would in Rajasthan. Plus, many ppl are hesitant to share personal information with strangers, even if they are officials. Building trust is essential, and that takes time and effort. The literacy rate in India is around 74.04% but that means a lot of folks might need assistance filling out forms.", "normalised": "Then there is the diversity.

{"unnormalised": "Another huge factor is migration. Millions of people move from rural areas to cities like Mumbai and Delhi every year in search of better opportunities. Tracking this constantly shifting population is a logistical nightmare. Often these migrants live in informal settlements which makes it even tougher to get accurate data. And let’s not forget about remote areas like the Himalayas or the tribal regions in the Northeast. Reaching these places is a huge challenge in itself and can cost ₹50,000 per enumerator to just travel.", "normalised": "Another huge factor is migration.

{"unnormalised": "Technology is helping, of course. The use of mobile apps and GPS is improving data collection and accuracy. But digital literacy is still a challenge for many ppl, particularly in rural areas. There are also concerns about data privacy and security.

It requires a lot of planning, resources, and coordination. But it's absolutely crucial for effective policymaking and development planning.
