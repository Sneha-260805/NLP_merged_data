You know, figuring out how many of us there are is a pretty big deal for planning everything from schools to hospitals, right?

Different sources might give you slightly different numbers – maybe 1.4286 billion or even 1.429. But the general consensus is we're the most populous country now. It's kinda crazy to think about, isn't it?", "normalised": "According to the latest estimates, India's population crossed the one point four billion mark sometime in two thousand and twenty three.

{"unnormalised": "A lot of the data comes from estimates and projections since the last full census was in 2011. The 2011 census showed a population of around 1.21 billion back then. So you can see how much we've grown in just over a decade. The decadal growth rate between 2001 and 2011 was somewhere around 17.7%, but projections suggest it's slowing down a bit now. It's all pretty complex stuff, but it's important to understand where we're headed.", "normalised": "A lot of the data comes from estimates and projections since the last full census was in two thousand and eleven.

Understanding these regional variations is key for targeted development. Anyway, hope this gives you a bit of a clearer picture!
