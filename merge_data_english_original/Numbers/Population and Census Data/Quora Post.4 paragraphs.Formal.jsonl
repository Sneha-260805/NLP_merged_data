{"unnormalised": "The 2021 Census of India, though delayed, offers critical insights into the nation's evolving demographic landscape. Provisional data indicates a population exceeding 1.38 billion, a considerable increase from the 1.21 billion recorded in 2011. This represents a decadal growth rate of approximately 1.3%, a noticeable decline compared to the 1.7% observed in the previous census period. This slowing growth rate suggests the impact of various family planning initiatives and socio-economic factors.", "normalised": "The two thousand twenty one Census of India, though delayed, offers critical insights into the nation's evolving demographic landscape. Provisional data indicates a population exceeding one point three eight billion, a considerable increase from the one point two one billion recorded in two thousand eleven. This represents a decadal growth rate of approximately one point three percent, a noticeable decline compared to the one point seven percent observed in the previous census period. This slowing growth rate suggests the impact of various family planning initiatives and socio-economic factors."}
{"unnormalised": "One significant trend is the shifting sex ratio. While historically skewed, there's a gradual improvement. Preliminary estimates suggest a sex ratio of around 935 females per 1000 males, a positive shift from the 933/1000 reported in 2011. States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu continue to exhibit favorable sex ratios, while others, particularly in the northern regions, require focused interventions. Infant mortality rates (IMR) are also declining, although disparities persist between rural and urban areas, and across different states. The IMR hovers around 30 per 1000 live births according to recent surveys.", "normalised": "One significant trend is the shifting sex ratio. While historically skewed, there's a gradual improvement. Preliminary estimates suggest a sex ratio of around nine hundred and thirty five females per one thousand males, a positive shift from the nine hundred and thirty three slash one thousand reported in two thousand eleven. States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu continue to exhibit favorable sex ratios, while others, particularly in the northern regions, require focused interventions. Infant mortality rates (I-M-R) are also declining, although disparities persist between rural and urban areas, and across different states. The I-M-R hovers around thirty per one thousand live births according to recent surveys."}
{"unnormalised": "Literacy rates have shown substantial progress. The overall literacy rate is estimated to be above 77%, a marked improvement from the 74% reported in the 2011 census. Female literacy rates are rising at a faster pace, contributing to a narrowing gender gap. However, variations exist across states, with states like Bihar and Rajasthan lagging behind the national average. This underscores the need for targeted educational programs to address regional disparities.", "normalised": "Literacy rates have shown substantial progress.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, urbanization continues to be a key demographic trend. The proportion of the population residing in urban areas is steadily increasing, driven by factors such as economic opportunities, migration, and improved infrastructure. It is projected that by 2030, over 40% of India’s population will reside in urban centers. This rapid urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring effective urban planning and sustainable development strategies to ensure inclusive growth and improved quality of life. Data on migration patterns also indicates that approx. 2.5 million people migrated from UP to other states.", "normalised": "Finally, urbanization continues to be a key demographic trend.

This rapid urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring effective urban planning and sustainable development strategies to ensure inclusive growth and improved quality of life. Data on migration patterns also indicates that approximately two point five million people migrated from U-P to other states."}
