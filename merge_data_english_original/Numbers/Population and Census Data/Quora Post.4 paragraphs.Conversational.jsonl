The provisional figures from the 2021 census showed India's population crossing the 1.39 billion mark. While the final data is still awaited, the initial reports suggest a growth rate lower than the previous decade. This is actually a pretty big deal, and people are looking at the numbers closely.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about the recent population trends in India, so thought I'd share what I know.

For example, preliminary data indicated a slight improvement in the sex ratio, reaching around 930 females per 1000 males.
