{"unnormalised": "So, according to the 2011 census, India had a pop of 1.21 billion. Fast forward to 2023, some estimates put us at around 1.4286 billion. That's a significant jump! Of course, these are just estimates since we haven't had another official census yet. The next big survey was initially planned for 2021, but due to COVID and other issues, it's been delayed. The last actual census data we have is still from 2011, which breaks down the population by state, religion, caste, and all sorts of demographics. We use those numbers for a LOT of planning.", "normalised": "So, according to the two thousand eleven census, India had a population of one point two one billion.

{"unnormalised": "One interesting thing is the growth rate. From 2001 to 2011, the annual growth rate was about 1.64%. If the 2023 estimates are accurate, it looks like the growth rate has slowed down a bit, maybe to around 1.1% or so per year. Though you hear different figures. It makes you think about all the policies and programs aimed at managing population growth. Numbers might seem boring, but they really paint a picture of what's happening in the country.", "normalised": "One interesting thing is the growth rate.

{"unnormalised": "And it's not just about the overall number. The distribution is important too. Uttar Pradesh is still the most populous state, with something like 199,812,341 people in 2011. That's like, a whole other country within India! And then you have states like Sikkim with only around 610,577 people. Those disparities impact everything from resource allocation to political representation. Plus, there’s the urban-rural divide. More and more people are moving to cities like Mumbai and Delhi for jobs. This shift creates a whole host of new challenges (and opportunities!)", "normalised": "And it is not just about the overall number. The distribution is important too.
