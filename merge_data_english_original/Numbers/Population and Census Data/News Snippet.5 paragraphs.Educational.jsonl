{"unnormalised": "The provisional figures from the 2021 Census, released recently, provide a glimpse into India's evolving demographic landscape. While the full report with detailed breakdowns is still awaited, initial findings suggest some significant trends. India’s total population has crossed the 1.4 billion mark (140 Cr), reflecting a growth of approximately 1.1% from the 2011 Census figures.

While the full report with detailed breakdowns is still awaited, initial findings suggest some significant trends. India's total population has crossed the one point four billion mark (one hundred and forty crore), reflecting a growth of approximately one point one percent from the two thousand eleven Census figures.

{"unnormalised": "One noteworthy observation is the changing sex ratio. Although the detailed figures are pending, preliminary data indicates a marginal improvement in the number of females per 1000 males, rising from 940 in 2011 to an estimated 943 in 2021. This positive trend, however small, indicates the effectiveness of ongoing initiatives like \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao.\" Further analysis will be needed to ascertain the regional variations and pinpoint areas needing increased focus. States like Kerala traditionally show higher ratios, while others such as Haryana have historically lagged.", "normalised": "One noteworthy observation is the changing sex ratio.

{"unnormalised": "Urbanization continues its upward trajectory, with a substantial increase in the proportion of the population residing in urban areas. It's estimated that over 35% of Indians now live in cities and towns, up from roughly 31% in 2011. This shift presents both opportunities and challenges. Urban areas become engines of economic growth but also face pressures on infrastructure, sanitation, and housing. Managing this urban transition effectively will be a key policy priority. Metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi have seen particularly high influxes.", "normalised": "Urbanization continues its upward trajectory, with a substantial increase in the proportion of the population residing in urban areas.

{"unnormalised": "Literacy rates have also witnessed an increase, though the pace of improvement appears to have slowed slightly compared to previous decades. The 2021 Census puts the overall literacy rate at around 77.7%, a rise from 74.04% in 2011. While gains have been made, disparities persist between rural and urban areas and across different social groups. Addressing these inequalities will require targeted interventions and sustained efforts to improve access to quality education for all.", "normalised": "Literacy rates have also witnessed an increase, though the pace of improvement appears to have slowed slightly compared to previous decades.
