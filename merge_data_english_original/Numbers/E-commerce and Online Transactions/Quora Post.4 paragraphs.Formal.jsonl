{"unnormalised": "Well, the accuracy of prices displayed on e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart and Amazon is generally high, but discrepancies can and do occur. Several factors influence these price variations. For example, algorithmic pricing, where prices fluctuate based on demand, competitor pricing, and even user browsing behavior, is a significant element. A product listed at ₹499 at 10:00 AM might be ₹549 by 12:00 PM due to a surge in demand or a competitor's price change. Flash sales and limited-time offers often have clear start and end times, like \"Sale ends 23:59 hrs,\" and prices revert accordingly.", "normalised": "Well, the accuracy of prices displayed on e-commerce platforms such as F-l-i-p-k-a-r-t and Amazon is generally high, but discrepancies can and do occur.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, sellers on these platforms often manage their own inventory and pricing. While platforms have mechanisms to monitor and prevent gross mispricing, errors can still happen. A seller might accidentally list a product at ₹199 instead of ₹1999. Such errors are usually corrected swiftly, but consumers occasionally manage to purchase items at these incorrect prices. The listed price generally includes GST, but it is always wise to confirm, especially for bulk orders over ₹5000, to avoid surprises.", "normalised": "Furthermore, sellers on these platforms often manage their own inventory and pricing.

Cashback offers, instant discounts via specific banks (e.g., \"10% off on HDFC Bank cards\"), and promotional coupons (e.g., \"Use code DIWALI20 for 20% off\") might not always be accurately reflected until the final checkout page. Always double-check the final amount before confirming the transaction, paying particular attention to shipping charges, which can vary from ₹0 to ₹100 depending on the seller and location (e.g., \"Free delivery above ₹999\").
