Just in time for my trip.\" The price? Just Rs. 299. Seemed like a steal.", "normalised": "So, I've always considered myself pretty tech-savvy. Online shopping? Pfft, a piece of cake!

{"unnormalised": "So, here I am, two online shopping experiences gone wrong. I've initiated return requests for both items. The refund process for the phone case is \"pending,\" and the estimated refund date is 31/07/2024. The headphone return is still \"under review.\" Lesson learned?

And maybe I'll just stick with buying chai for Rs. 20 at my usual stall. Less hassle, same disappointment... just kidding (sort of)!", "normalised": "So, here I am, two online shopping experiences gone wrong. I've initiated return requests for both items.
