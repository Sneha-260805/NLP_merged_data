{"unnormalised": "In the end, I had to cancel the order and go to a local store in Lajpat Nagar and buy a different phone. Paid Rs. 26000, no discount, but at least my dad had a new phone for Diwali. Online shopping can be convenient, but during these sales, sometimes it's just too much of a hassle. I think next time, I'll just stick to buying mithai online, those deliveries usually arrive on time.
