{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me how online shopping has changed in India. Honestly, it's been a massive transformation! Remember those days when we'd only shop in brick-and-mortar stores? Now, I buy practically everything online. Last month alone, I made 7 purchases on Amazon, spending approximately Rs. 8500. Flipkart's also become a go-to, especially for electronics. My friend just bought a new phone for ₹15999 after using a bunch of coupons.", "normalised": "Someone asked me how online shopping has changed in India. Honestly, it's been a massive transformation!

{"unnormalised": "The biggest change? Convenience, without a doubt. I can shop at 2:00 AM if I want to. And the discounts! Often better than anything you'll find in a store. I recently snagged a pressure cooker on Tata CLiQ for 40% off – it was listed at ₹2800, but I got it for much less. Plus, the return policies are generally pretty good. Though, I did have a bad experience once where I ordered a saree for ₹1200 and it arrived damaged. Thankfully, I got a full refund.", "normalised": "The biggest change? Convenience, without a doubt.

{"unnormalised": "But it's not all sunshine and roses. I do worry about online security. I always make sure the website is legit before entering my credit card details. I've also heard stories about people being scammed, especially on smaller, less well-known platforms. Also, the delivery times can be frustrating. Sometimes it takes 5-7 days for something to arrive, which feels like forever in today's world. Once I ordered something which was supposed to be delivered in 3 days, but finally arrived after 10 days, thankfully at no extra delivery cost.", "normalised": "But it's not all sunshine and roses.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, online shopping in India is here to stay. The convenience and discounts are hard to resist. Just be careful, do your research, and read the reviews before you click 'buy'. And keep an eye out for those crazy flash sales – I saw one on Myntra the other day where clothes were going for as low as Rs. 299!", "normalised": "Overall, online shopping in India is here to stay.
