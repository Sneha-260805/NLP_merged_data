It's pretty much the norm these days, but let's be real, understanding the numbers behind those sweet deals can be a bit of a puzzle.

{"unnormalised": "First off, that tempting discount. \"Flat 50% off on sarees!\" sounds amazing, right? But always check the original price. If a saree is listed at ₹2000 (Rs. two thousand), and there's a 50% discount, you’re actually saving ₹1000 (Rs. one thousand), and paying ₹1000. But sometimes, there's a catch. Maybe that 50% is only on selected items, or only applies if your cart value is ₹5000 or more. Always, always read the fine print!", "normalised": "First off, that tempting discount. \"Flat fifty percent off on sarees!\" sounds amazing, right? But always check the original price.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the delivery charges. A lot of sites offer \"free delivery above ₹499\" (Rs. four hundred and ninety nine). So, if you're buying something that costs ₹450 (Rs. four hundred and fifty), you might want to add another small item to cross that threshold and save on shipping.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing to watch out for is EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) options. Many e-commerce sites offer EMI plans, especially for expensive items like phones or laptops. They might advertise \"Easy EMIs starting at ₹2000/month\" (Rs. two thousand per month). But remember to factor in the interest rate! A 0% EMI sounds like a dream, but it’s rare.

Some platforms, especially for booking tickets, might add a small \"convenience fee\" of, say, ₹25 (Rs. twenty five) on top of the ticket price.

{"unnormalised": "Returns and refunds also have their own set of rules. If you return an item, the refund process might take a few days.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, keep an eye out for seasonal sales like Diwali or Dussehra sales. They often have the best deals, with discounts sometimes going up to 80% on certain products.
