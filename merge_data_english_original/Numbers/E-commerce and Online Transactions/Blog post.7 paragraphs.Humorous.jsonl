{"unnormalised": "So, I did it again. Fell victim to the siren song of online shopping. You know the one – that little notification that whispers sweet nothings like \"70% off!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" before promptly draining your bank account. This time, it was on \"Glamazon.in\" – don't judge, they have good deals (sometimes). I ended up buying 3 sarees (even though I only wear them, like, twice a year), a gadget I definitely don’t need, and a lifetime supply of chai. The final bill came to ₹8750, which, let’s be honest, is roughly the same as my rent for the month (I wish!).", "normalised": "So, I did it again. Fell victim to the siren song of online shopping.

{"unnormalised": "It all started innocently enough. I was just browsing, as one does on a boring Tuesday afternoon. Saw an ad for \"Ethnic Emporium\" with a saree that screamed \"Diwali!\" – even though Diwali is, like, 6 months away. Next thing I know, I'm adding it to my cart. Then, \"Oh look! A matching blouse for only ₹499!\" And then another saree because, well, why not? They were offering \"Buy 2 Get 1 Free\" - a trap I ALWAYS fall into. I mean, who can resist a \"free\" saree, even if you didn't need the first two?!", "normalised": "It all started innocently enough. I was just browsing, as one does on a boring Tuesday afternoon.
