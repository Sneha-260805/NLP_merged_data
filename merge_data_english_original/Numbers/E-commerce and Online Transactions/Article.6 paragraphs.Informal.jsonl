Ever noticed those random discounts? \"Flat 40% off\" screams the banner, but then you see a tiny asterisk and realize it's only on orders above Rs. 2000! Plus, sometimes the delivery charges are a total rip-off, like Rs. 99 for a small item. And let's not even talk about the COD option, which, if you opt for, suddenly adds ₹50 as 'handling charges'. Wah, what handling, bhai?", "normalised": "But all this convenience comes with its own set of quirks, no?

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on the flash sales! Sites like Myntra and Ajio are always having those \"limited time offers\" where things are supposedly \"70% off.\" You rush to add stuff to your cart, only to find out the sizes you need are already sold out in 5 minutes. It's all a clever trick to create a sense of urgency and make us buy stuff we don't really need.
