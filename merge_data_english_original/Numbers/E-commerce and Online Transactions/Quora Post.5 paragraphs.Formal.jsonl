{"unnormalised": "Online shopping in India has exploded, but so have the scams. One common trick is \"Fake Websites.\" These look like legitimate e-commerce sites, perhaps mimicking a popular brand, but they exist solely to steal your credit card info. Always double-check the URL, looking for typos and ensuring \"https://\" is present.

{"unnormalised": "Another prevalent issue is \"Phishing Emails/SMS.\" You might get a message claiming a problem with your order (even if you didn't place one!) and asking you to click a link to \"verify\" your details. Never click on suspicious links. Always go directly to the retailer's official website (e.g., Amazon.in, Flipkart.com) and log in to check your order status. Don't trust caller IDs either; fraudsters can spoof legitimate company numbers.", "normalised": "Another prevalent issue is \"Phishing Emails slash S-M-S.\" You might get a message claiming a problem with your order (even if you didn't place one!) and asking you to click a link to \"verify\" your details.

{"unnormalised": "\"Fake Product Listings\" are also a big problem. Sellers might list counterfeit or low-quality items as genuine products. Read reviews carefully, especially negative ones. Check the seller's rating and history. If a deal seems too good to be true (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro Max for ₹20,000), it probably is. Pay attention to details; poor product descriptions or blurry images are warning signs.", "normalised": "\"Fake Product Listings\" are also a big problem.

{"unnormalised": "Be wary of \"UPI Fraud.\" Scammers might trick you into approving payment requests without realizing it. Always double-check the recipient's UPI ID before confirming the transaction. Avoid making payments to unknown or unverified UPI IDs.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, use secure payment methods. Credit cards generally offer better fraud protection than debit cards. Consider using virtual credit cards for online purchases. Always enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your e-commerce accounts for added security. Report any suspicious activity to the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) immediately. Staying vigilant is key to safe online shopping.", "normalised": "Finally, use secure payment methods. Credit cards generally offer better fraud protection than debit cards.
