{"unnormalised": "First up, let's talk about discounts. You often see enticing offers like \"Flat 50% off\" or \"Buy 1 get 1 free.\" But have you ever calculated the actual savings? A product listed at Rs. 2000 with a 50% discount will cost you Rs. 1000. Understanding percentages is key to making informed decisions and avoiding those \"too good to be true\" deals.

It's important to calculate the total interest you'll be paying over the entire EMI period.
