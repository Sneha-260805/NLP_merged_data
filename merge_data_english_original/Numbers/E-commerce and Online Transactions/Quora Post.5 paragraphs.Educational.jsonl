On one hand, platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have pretty secure payment gateways using protocols like SSL, with 128-bit encryption. They also offer buyer protection, refund policies, and escrow services to minimize risk. Most debit cards issued by banks like SBI and HDFC require 2-factor authentication (2FA) with OTPs, which adds an extra layer of security.

Cybercriminals send fake emails or SMSes that look legitimate, tricking users into entering their credit card details or bank account numbers on fake websites. Never click on links in suspicious emails and always verify the URL. In 2023, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) reported over 1.3 million cyber security incidents, many of which were related to online financial fraud. A lot of times, the fraudulent transactions may be for a relatively smaller amount, say ₹ 500, to test if the user is vigilant.", "normalised": "However, phishing scams are still rampant.

{"unnormalised": "UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is convenient, but also has its risks. Many people fall prey to scams where they are asked to \"receive\" money by entering their UPI PIN. Remember, a UPI PIN is only required when you are sending money, not receiving it. Scammers also use QR codes to direct users to malicious websites or apps. Always double-check the recipient's name and UPI ID before making a payment. For instance, my neighbour Sharma Ji lost ₹ 20000 in such a scam last year.", "normalised": "U-P-I (Unified Payments Interface) is convenient, but also has its risks.

Companies are required to comply with data protection laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000, but breaches still happen.
