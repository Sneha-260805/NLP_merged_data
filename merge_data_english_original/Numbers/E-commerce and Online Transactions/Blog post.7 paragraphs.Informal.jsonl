{"unnormalised": "First off, the crazy discounts are getting even crazier! Like, I saw a dress listed for ₹199 after a \"massive\" 80% off. I mean, at that price, even if it falls apart after 2 washes, it's still worth it, no? Jokes aside, the competition is fierce, and everyone is trying to undercut each other. And it seems like the return policies keep getting more customer-friendly, too. Some sites are even offering 30-day no-questions-asked returns. Wah, what a time to be alive!", "normalised": "First off, the crazy discounts are getting even crazier!

{"unnormalised": "Another thing: the rise of smaller, niche e-commerce sites. You know, the ones that specialize in things like artisanal crafts or organic skincare. I bought a gorgeous handloom saree from one of these for Rs. 2500 and the quality was AMAZING. Supporting local businesses while getting something unique? Yes, please!

{"unnormalised": "But here's where it gets a little tricky. I've noticed some websites being sneaky with their prices. Like, they'll bump up the \"shipping charges\" to like, Rs. 99 after luring you in with a cheap product. Or they will show you one price then sneakily add tax + convenience fee and other surcharges which were hidden initially. Always double-check before hitting that \"Pay Now\" button, alright? Make sure you read the fine print especially concerning return policies before you add the product in cart, as the final price might be Rs. 50 or even Rs. 100 more!", "normalised": "But here is where it gets a little tricky.

Just remember to shop smart, compare prices, read reviews, and always double-check that final amount before you click confirm!
