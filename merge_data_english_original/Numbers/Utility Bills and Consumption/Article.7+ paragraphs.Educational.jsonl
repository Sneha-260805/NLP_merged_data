{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you'll notice is your \"Consumer Number\" or \"Account ID.\" This is a unique identifier for your electricity connection, much like your Aadhaar number, and is essential for all communication with your electricity provider (e.g., Tata Power, BSES Delhi). The bill also states the billing period, for example, \"01/07/2024 - 31/07/2024,\" indicating the time frame for which you're being charged. Check these dates carefully to ensure accuracy.", "normalised": "One of the first things you'll notice is your \"Consumer Number\" or \"Account I-D.\" This is a unique identifier for your electricity connection, much like your Aadhaar number, and is essential for all communication with your electricity provider (e.g., Tata Power, B-S-E-S Delhi). The bill also states the billing period, for example, \"first july two thousand and twenty four to thirty first july two thousand and twenty four,\" indicating the time frame for which you're being charged. Check these dates carefully to ensure accuracy."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, the bill will display your \"Meter Reading.\" This section shows both the previous reading and the current reading taken by the meter reader. For instance, \"Previous Reading: 12345 units, Current Reading: 12545 units.\" The difference between these two readings represents your total electricity consumption for the billing period. The unit of measurement is typically \"kWh\" (kilowatt-hours). So in this example, the consumption is 200 kWh.", "normalised": "Next, the bill will display your \"Meter Reading.\" This section shows both the previous reading and the current reading taken by the meter reader. For instance, \"Previous Reading: twelve thousand three hundred and forty five units, Current Reading: twelve thousand five hundred and forty five units.\" The difference between these two readings represents your total electricity consumption for the billing period. The unit of measurement is typically \"kilowatt-hours.\" So in this example, the consumption is two hundred kilowatt-hours."}
{"unnormalised": "A critical element is the \"Tariff Rate.\" This specifies the cost per unit of electricity. Electricity companies often have tiered pricing structures, meaning the rate you pay per kWh increases as your consumption goes up. For example, the first 100 units might be charged at Rs. 3 per unit, the next 200 units at Rs. 5 per unit, and so on. Understanding your tariff structure is crucial for managing your electricity costs. Check the tariff slab, it might be \"Rs 3/unit for 0-100 units, Rs 5.5/unit for 101-300 units, Rs 7/unit above 300 units\".", "normalised": "A critical element is the \"Tariff Rate.\" This specifies the cost per unit of electricity. Electricity companies often have tiered pricing structures, meaning the rate you pay per kilowatt-hour increases as your consumption goes up. For example, the first one hundred units might be charged at rupees three per unit, the next two hundred units at rupees five per unit, and so on. Understanding your tariff structure is crucial for managing your electricity costs. Check the tariff slab, it might be \"rupees three per unit for zero to one hundred units, rupees five point five per unit for one hundred and one to three hundred units, rupees seven per unit above three hundred units\"."}
{"unnormalised": "The \"Fixed Charges\" are a separate component, representing a fixed monthly cost regardless of your consumption. This fee covers the electricity provider's infrastructure and maintenance costs. The fixed charges might be \"Rs. 100 per month\" depending on your sanctioned load, the amount of power you're allowed to draw from the grid.", "normalised": "The \"Fixed Charges\" are a separate component, representing a fixed monthly cost regardless of your consumption. This fee covers the electricity provider's infrastructure and maintenance costs. The fixed charges might be \"rupees one hundred per month\" depending on your sanctioned load, the amount of power you're allowed to draw from the grid."}
{"unnormalised": "\"Electricity Duty\" and other taxes are also added to the bill. These are government-imposed taxes on electricity consumption and vary from state to state. A common example is \"Electricity Duty @ 5%.\" Other charges might include fuel surcharge adjustments (FSA), which fluctuate based on the cost of fuel used for power generation.", "normalised": "\"Electricity Duty\" and other taxes are also added to the bill.

{"unnormalised": "Let's consider a hypothetical example: Rakesh Kumar from Mumbai consumes 250 kWh in a month. His tariff is Rs. 4 per unit for the first 100 units and Rs. 6 per unit for the remaining 150 units. His fixed charges are Rs. 150, and electricity duty is 5%. His bill would be calculated as follows: (100 units * Rs. 4) + (150 units * Rs. 6) + Rs. 150 + 5% duty on the total energy charge. This calculation demonstrates how each component contributes to the final amount due.", "normalised": "Let's consider a hypothetical example: Rakesh Kumar from Mumbai consumes two hundred and fifty kilowatt-hours in a month. His tariff is rupees four per unit for the first one hundred units and rupees six per unit for the remaining one hundred and fifty units. His fixed charges are rupees one hundred and fifty, and electricity duty is five percent. His bill would be calculated as follows: (one hundred units multiplied by rupees four) plus (one hundred and fifty units multiplied by rupees six) plus rupees one hundred and fifty plus five percent duty on the total energy charge. This calculation demonstrates how each component contributes to the final amount due."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, the bill will display the \"Due Date\" for payment. Late payment charges are usually applied if you don't pay by the due date, which is often expressed as \"DD/MM/YYYY\". Common payment methods include online payments through the electricity provider's website or mobile app, payment through UPI (e.g., PhonePe, Paytm), or payment at designated bill collection centers.", "normalised": "Finally, the bill will display the \"Due Date\" for payment.
