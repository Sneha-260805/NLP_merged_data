{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about electricity bills. Usually, you'll see your energy consumption measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours). For example, my last bill showed 350 kWh consumed. That's essentially the amount of electricity I used in a month. Now, different states have different tariffs, but generally, there are slabs. The more you consume, the higher the rate per unit. The first 100 units might be charged at, say, Rs. 3.50 per unit, while anything above that could be Rs. 6 or even Rs. 8. Remember, electricity companies add various other charges, such as meter rent, fixed charges, and fuel adjustment costs. These can easily inflate a bill and cause one to be confused.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about electricity bills. Usually, you'll see your energy consumption measured in kilowatt-hours.

{"unnormalised": "Water bills are typically based on volume consumed, measured in liters or kiloliters (1 kiloliter = 1000 liters). My building society charges Rs. 15 per kiloliter after a certain threshold, for example, 10 KL. Before that, we pay a flat rate in our maintenance charge. However, some houses are metered, so you pay for what you use. Don't forget about sewage charges, which are often calculated as a percentage of your water bill – say, 30% or 50%. I remember one month when I had a leak and my water bill jumped by like, 250%, it was insane and expensive!", "normalised": "Water bills are typically based on volume consumed, measured in liters or kiloliters (one kiloliter equals one thousand liters).

Right now, subsidized cylinders are priced around Rs. 900, but if you exceed your quota, you'll pay the market rate, which is significantly higher. Also, check your bill for any delivery charges or other fees that might be added. Also, it is important to check the weight of the cylinder.
