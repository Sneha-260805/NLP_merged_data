So, 150 multiplied by 7.5 gives you ₹1125 just for the electricity used. Then add on those fixed charges, say ₹50, and any meter rent, maybe ₹20. Also check for any arrears or previous dues - they'll be listed separately! So, the total is ₹1125 + ₹50 + ₹20 plus any arrears. Keep an eye on your consumption pattern too; if it jumps from 100 kWh to 200 kWh suddenly, find out why.
