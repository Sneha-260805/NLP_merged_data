{"unnormalised": "Analyzing your electricity bills is indeed a prudent way to understand and potentially reduce your energy consumption. Utility bills, such as those from BSES or Tata Power, often contain a wealth of information. Look for your average monthly consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Comparing these figures month-on-month can reveal seasonal trends or identify periods of unusually high usage. Furthermore, some bills provide a breakdown of consumption during peak and off-peak hours, allowing you to identify whether you’re primarily using electricity during times when rates are higher. Check if there is any mention of a smart meter reading, and whether you’re being charged under a TOU (Time of Use) tariff.", "normalised": "Analyzing your electricity bills is indeed a prudent way to understand and potentially reduce your energy consumption.

{"unnormalised": "Another aspect to consider is the tariff structure. Electricity companies like MSEB often have tiered pricing systems. Your per-unit cost may increase as your consumption rises beyond certain thresholds. For example, the first 100 units (kWh) might be charged at Rs. 3.50/unit, while consumption above 500 units could be Rs. 7.50/unit. Understanding these tiers can inform your conservation efforts; even reducing your consumption slightly could move you into a lower pricing bracket. Finally, look at any fixed charges or meter rentals. These are constant, regardless of your consumption, but understanding them provides a complete picture of your bill. Also, check for any delayed payment surcharge that might be applicable (DPS).", "normalised": "Another aspect to consider is the tariff structure.

{"unnormalised": "You can also compare your bills with neighbours or similar households. If your consumption significantly exceeds theirs, it suggests inefficiencies that warrant investigation. Look at the billing cycle date mentioned on your bill. A billing cycle lasting between 28-32 days can also effect the amount.
