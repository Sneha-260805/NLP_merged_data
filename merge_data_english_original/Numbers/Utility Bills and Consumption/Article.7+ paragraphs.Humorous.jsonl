{"unnormalised": "First, there’s the electricity bill. A complex tapestry of kWh consumed, peak hours, off-peak hours, and enough surcharges to make your head spin. You swear you've been extra careful, switching off lights and unplugging phantom-energy-sucking appliances. Yet, the bill stubbornly proclaims you used 520 kWh this month, which is apparently 15% more than last month. Did someone secretly plug a Bitcoin mining rig into your wall socket?

And while the numbers may seem intimidating, just remember: at least you have electricity to power your cat video habit, water to brew your chai, and internet to complain about your bills on social media. So, chin up, fellow bill-payers! We're all in this numerical adventure together. Maybe we can start a support group and share tips on how to outsmart the electricity meter.
