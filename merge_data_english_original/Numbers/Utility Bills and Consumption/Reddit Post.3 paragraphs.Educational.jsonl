{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, I'm trying to understand my electricity bill better. It seems like there's a lot of info packed in there! Specifically, I’m struggling with how they calculate the units consumed. My bill shows \"350 kWh\" used this month. Does that mean I used 350,000 watts in one hour? That sounds insane! Anyone know a simple way to understand this? My bill also shows a fixed charge of Rs. 150, and then a per-unit cost.", "normalised": "Hey guys, I am trying to understand my electricity bill better.

My neighbour said something about power factor and voltage, but I didn’t really understand what he was trying to say. I'm based in Mumbai, and apparently, the rates change depending on your consumption slab.
