{"unnormalised": "Hey there, someone asked about understanding those crazy utility bills we get in India, right? Especially the electricity ones... feels like they’re written in another language sometimes, lol. So, basically, first thing to look at is your consumption, listed in kWh – usually something like 350 kWh for a 2BHK apartment in Mumbai in the summer. Keep in mind this can vary greatly based on AC usage!", "normalised": "Hey there, someone asked about understanding those crazy utility bills we get in India, right?

So, for the first 100 units, it might be ₹3.50 per unit, then ₹5.20 for the next 200, and so on. This is where things get tricky! Plus, there's a fixed charge – something like ₹150-₹200, regardless of how much you use.", "normalised": "Then you got to check the tariff slab. See, they do not charge you a flat rate. It is tiered.

{"unnormalised": "Don't forget about the pesky extra charges! There’s electricity duty, which is a percentage of your bill (usually around 5-10%). Then, sometimes there’s a fuel surcharge adjustment (FSA) based on fluctuating coal prices, can be a small amount, like 0.10 per unit. And if you’re late paying, expect a late payment surcharge, often a percentage, say 2%, of the bill amount. Ouch!", "normalised": "Do not forget about the pesky extra charges!

{"unnormalised": "Finally, if you have a smart meter (which more and more places are getting), you might also see peak hour consumption details. This could eventually influence pricing even more. To save some ₹₹₹, try to shift heavy usage (washing machine, geyser) to off-peak hours. And check your bill online – most providers (like BEST in Mumbai or BSES in Delhi) have apps where you can track your consumption over time!
