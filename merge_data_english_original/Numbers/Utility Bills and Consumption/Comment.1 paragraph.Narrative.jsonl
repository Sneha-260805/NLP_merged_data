{"unnormalised": "Arre yaar, my electricity bill this month was shocking! Last month, it was around ₹2500, but this time it's ₹4875. I don't understand how it jumped so much. Maybe it’s because I used the AC more due to the heatwave in Delhi, or perhaps the meter reading on 15/07 was incorrect. Need to call BSES and complain; this is ridiculous. Consumption showed as 550 units, which seems crazy high for just one month. My neighbour's bill, living in a similar flat, was only 3000 Rs. Something is definitely fishy!", "normalised": "Arre yaar, my electricity bill this month was shocking!
