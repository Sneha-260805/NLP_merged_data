{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I know everyone’s been there. You're casually enjoying life, binge-watching some Netflix after a long day of WFH, maybe with the AC set to a comfortable 24°C. Then BAM! The electricity bill arrives, and it's like, \"Surprise! You owe ₹8,500!\" My mom nearly had a heart attack last month when she saw the bill – she swore we were running a Bitcoin mining operation from our 2BHK in Andheri. I checked the meter reading myself, it went from 12345 units to 12987 units in just one month! Is the meter secretly powered by a black hole?", "normalised": "Okay, so I know everyone’s been there.

Like that's gonna fix the problem of what feels like a small nuclear power plant running in my house. Perhaps I should consult a baba to exorcise the demonic appliances?", "normalised": "Seriously though, I suspect our ceiling fan is secretly training to become a jet engine.
