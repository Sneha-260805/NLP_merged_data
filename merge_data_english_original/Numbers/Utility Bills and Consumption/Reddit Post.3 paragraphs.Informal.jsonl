{"unnormalised": "Okay guys, need some advice! My electricity bill this month is insane - ₹5,500! Last month it was like ₹3,200. I live in a 2BHK in Bangalore, and honestly, I don't think I'm using *that* much electricity. We mostly use the AC at night, maybe 4-5 hours. Is anyone else facing a similar issue? Any tips on how to reduce consumption? My meter reading shows a total of 650 units consumed this month.", "normalised": "Okay guys, need some advice!

{"unnormalised": "I'm thinking of getting one of those smart meters, but I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. Has anyone tried those? Do they actually help in identifying where the power is being guzzled? Also, I'm considering switching to LED bulbs everywhere. Right now, I have a mix of CFLs and LEDs. Maybe that's contributing to the high bill? The water bill is also kinda high at Rs. 1200, but I guess that's Bangalore for ya!", "normalised": "I am thinking of getting one of those smart meters, but I am not sure if it is worth the investment.

I'm seriously thinking of calling them up and complaining. I'm just worried they'll say everything is normal and I'm stuck with this ₹5.5k bill! Thanks in advance for any help!", "normalised": "Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated! Maybe B E S C O M is playing some games with the meter readings, laugh out loud.
