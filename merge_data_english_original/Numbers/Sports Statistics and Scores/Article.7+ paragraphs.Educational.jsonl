{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. In cricket, for example, the average runs scored by a batsman is a key metric. Someone like Virat Kohli, with a Test average consistently above 50, is statistically a world-class player. Similarly, a bowler's economy rate (runs conceded per over) paints a picture of their effectiveness. A figure below 3.5, like that of Jasprit Bumrah, suggests exceptional control and wicket-taking ability. Consider an ODI match where India scored 320/5 in 50 overs. To dissect this, you might look at the individual contributions; perhaps Rohit Sharma scored 115 off 130 balls, while KL Rahul contributed 70 off 50. This information provides a more granular view of the innings.", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics. In cricket, for example, the average runs scored by a batsman is a key metric.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to football, the statistics are equally revealing. Goals scored, assists provided, and shots on target are obvious indicators of attacking prowess. But delve deeper, and you'll find metrics like pass completion percentage, tackles won, and interceptions made, offering insights into a player's overall contribution. A player with a pass accuracy of 85% or more, like Toni Kroos, is often considered a midfield maestro. Imagine a Premier League match where Man City had 65% possession and 15 shots on goal compared to Liverpool's 35% possession and 5 shots. While possession doesn’t guarantee victory, it often correlates with territorial dominance and attacking opportunities.", "normalised": "Moving on to football, the statistics are equally revealing.

A player with a pass accuracy of eighty five percent or more, like Toni Kroos, is often considered a midfield maestro.

{"unnormalised": "Basketball offers another rich landscape for statistical analysis. Points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), and assists per game (APG) are standard measures of individual performance. But advanced metrics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares attempt to quantify a player's overall value to their team. Someone like Lebron James, with a career PER above 27, is statistically among the greatest to ever play the game. If a player averages 25.5 PPG, 7.2 RPG, and 6.8 APG across a season, it demonstrates a well-rounded skillset and significant impact on the team's performance.", "normalised": "Basketball offers another rich landscape for statistical analysis.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond individual stats, team-level data provides valuable insights. In hockey, power play percentage and penalty killing percentage are critical indicators of special teams' effectiveness. A power play success rate above 20% is generally considered good. In baseball, batting average, earned run average (ERA) for pitchers, and fielding percentage are fundamental stats for evaluating team performance. A team with a batting average of .270 or higher is typically considered a strong offensive team.", "normalised": "Beyond individual stats, team-level data provides valuable insights.

{"unnormalised": "Remember that context matters. A stat in isolation is just a number; it's the understanding of the game, the player, and the circumstances that give it meaning. A batsman averaging 40 in Test matches might be highly regarded, but if they consistently struggle in overseas conditions, their overall value might be diminished. Similarly, a defender with a high number of tackles won might be effective, but if they frequently commit fouls that lead to penalties, their overall contribution might be negative.", "normalised": "Remember that context matters.
