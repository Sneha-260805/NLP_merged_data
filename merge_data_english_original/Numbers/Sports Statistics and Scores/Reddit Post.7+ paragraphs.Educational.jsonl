{"unnormalised": "First off, cricket. Obvious, right? But beyond just runs and wickets, look at strike rates. A T20 strike rate of 140+ is generally considered excellent. Then there's the average. A test average of 50+ for a batsman places them in the elite category. Also, Economy rates for bowlers, especially in limited-overs cricket. An economy rate under 6 is usually a sign of a very good bowler. Remember Sachin's 100 centuries? That’s 100, a figure unlikely to be matched anytime soon. Then we have things like balls faced vs runs scored. Really important for evaluating how good a batsman is.", "normalised": "First off, cricket. Obvious, right?
