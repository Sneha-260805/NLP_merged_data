You see people glued to their screens, yelling about a score of two hundred and forty five divided by six like it's the end of the world! My grandmother knows more about K-o-h-l-i's strike rate than she knows about her own grandson's marks in tenth standard. And don't even get me started on the commentators – they'll say something like, \"India needs twelve runs from six balls,\" and everyone gasps like they didn't just see that on the scoreboard for the last three overs! It's all a bit much, isn't it?"}

They throw around figures like \"S-a-c-h-i-n averaged fifty three point seven eight in Tests\" as if it's a perfectly normal thing to remember. Who keeps track of this stuff? And then there's the I-P-L, where the winning team gets like, rupee twenty crore? Seriously?! It's enough to make you want to pick up a bat, even if you last played cricket in Class eight and scored a glorious duck. My friend, R-a-v-i, keeps telling me about runs per over and wicket tallies. I just nod and smile, while internally calculating how many samosas I could buy with that I-P-L prize money."}
