Usually, a financial report for a small biz will have these core elements: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement, for example, will show your total revenue (like, say, ₹50,00,000 for the year) and then deduct all your expenses to arrive at your net profit or loss.

{"unnormalised": "The Cash Flow Statement tracks the movement of cash in and out of your business. This is crucial because you can be profitable on paper but still run out of cash.
