It could be your own monthly budget, a small business's profit and loss statement, or even the massive annual report of a company like Reliance Industries. They all follow the same basic principles: money in, money out, balance. Simple, right?", "normalised": "See, a financial report is like a snapshot – a moment in time.

Whether you're planning for a vacation to Kerala, saving for a new car, or the govt. is planning infrastructure projects across the country, a budget is your guiding star. A good budget forces you to think about priorities and anticipate potential problems. For example, if your projected expenses are consistently higher than your income, you know you need to cut back somewhere – maybe those daily chai runs gotta be reduced from 3 to just 1!", "normalised": "Budgets, on the other hand, are more like roadmaps.

She also has to pay an EMI of ₹15,000 for her car loan and ₹3,000 for her student loan. Her monthly savings? ₹26,000. Now, that's a healthy financial picture, right?
