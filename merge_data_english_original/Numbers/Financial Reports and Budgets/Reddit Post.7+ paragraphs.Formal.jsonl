This is not an exhaustive review, but rather a brief overview focusing on key figures and potential impacts."}
{"unnormalised": "Fellow investors,", "normalised": "First, let's look at the projected fiscal deficit. The budget estimates a fiscal deficit of five point one percent of G-D-P. This is a slight improvement from the revised estimate of five point eight percent for Financial Year twenty twenty three-twenty twenty four. The government aims to further reduce this to below four point five percent by Financial Year twenty twenty five-twenty twenty six. Achieving this target will be contingent on robust revenue growth and efficient expenditure management."}

This represents a substantial investment in infrastructure development, encompassing areas such as roads, railways, and ports. A larger CapEx will likely have a multiplier effect, stimulating economic activity and creating employment opportunities, especially across sectors such as cement with a projected growth of twelve percent Year over Year."}
{"unnormalised": "First, let's look at the projected fiscal deficit. The budget estimates a fiscal deficit of 5.1% of GDP. This is a slight improvement from the revised estimate of 5.8% for FY23-24. The government aims to further reduce this to below 4.5% by FY25-26. Achieving this target will be contingent on robust revenue growth and efficient expenditure management.", "normalised": "Regarding the agricultural sector, the budget allocates rupees two point eight three lakh crore towards rural development. This funding is intended to support initiatives aimed at improving agricultural productivity, enhancing irrigation facilities, and promoting sustainable farming practices. It will be interesting to see how this translates into tangible benefits for farmers and contributes to overall food security and G-D-P figures, which are expected to reach three hundred lakh crore."}
{"unnormalised": "Moving on to capital expenditure, the budget proposes a significant outlay of Rs. 11.11 lakh crore. This represents a substantial investment in infrastructure development, encompassing areas such as roads, railways, and ports. A larger CapEx will likely have a multiplier effect, stimulating economic activity and creating employment opportunities, especially across sectors such as cement with a projected growth of 12% YoY.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the budget proposes several measures to boost the M-S-M-E sector, including an allocation of rupees twenty thousand crore for a credit guarantee scheme. The scheme aims to facilitate access to credit for M-S-M-Es, enabling them to expand their operations and contribute to economic growth. This sector accounts for thirty percent of the G-D-P, and any growth here will be beneficial."}
{"unnormalised": "Regarding the agricultural sector, the budget allocates Rs 2.83 lakh crore towards rural development. This funding is intended to support initiatives aimed at improving agricultural productivity, enhancing irrigation facilities, and promoting sustainable farming practices. It will be interesting to see how this translates into tangible benefits for farmers and contributes to overall food security and GDP figures, which are expected to reach 300 lakh crores.", "normalised": "In terms of taxation, the budget maintains the existing tax rates for both individuals and corporations. However, it proposes certain measures to simplify the tax regime and enhance tax compliance. The estimated revenue collection from income tax is projected to be rupees nine point five lakh crore, whilst corporate tax is projected to reach rupees seven point two lakh crore."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the budget proposes several measures to boost the MSME sector, including an allocation of Rs 20,000 crore for a credit guarantee scheme. The scheme aims to facilitate access to credit for MSMEs, enabling them to expand their operations and contribute to economic growth. This sector accounts for 30% of the GDP, and any growth here will be beneficial.", "normalised": "Finally, a key takeaway is the emphasis on green growth. The budget outlines various initiatives to promote renewable energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable development. The government aims to achieve a target of five hundred G-W of renewable energy capacity by two thousand and thirty, requiring an investment of around rupees thirty five lakh crore. This will have long-term implications for India's energy security and climate goals."}
