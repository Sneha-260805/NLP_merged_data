This simply means the total income generated from its primary business activities. Keep an eye out for \"YoY Growth,\" like \"15% YoY Revenue Growth,\" which indicates how much revenue has increased compared to the previous year.", "normalised": "First, let us tackle Revenue.

Suppose you read \"EBITDA: Rs. 100 cr.\" This metric gives you a clearer picture of a company’s operational profitability, stripping away the effects of financing and accounting decisions. A healthy EBITDA margin (EBITDA divided by revenue), say \"EBITDA Margin: 20%,\" suggests the company is efficient in managing its core expenses.", "normalised": "Next up, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization – or E-B-I-T-D-A for short.
