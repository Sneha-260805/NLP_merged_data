He's got 20% of his portfolio in something called \"Guaranteed Growth Bonds\" (guaranteed to grow at what rate, a snail's pace?), 30% in fixed deposits at a whopping 6.5% interest (inflation laughs), and the remaining 50% chilling in a savings account earning, like, 3.5%? He thinks he's beating the market, but my calculations show his ROI is basically the price of a vada pav per year.", "normalised": "Guys, need some help understanding my dad’s “investment strategy.” He showed me his financial report and to be honest, it reads like a poorly written comedy sketch.

I saw a line item that said \"Rs. 5000 - 'Essential Pilgrimage Supplies'.\" I'm pretty sure that was a new 4G phone. The spreadsheet itself looks like it was designed in MS-DOS, circa 1995.
