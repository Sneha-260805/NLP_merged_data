{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. Your medical records are likely to contain a range of numerical data, from vital signs to lab results. For instance, your blood pressure might be recorded as 120/80 mmHg (millimeters of mercury), representing systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. A reading consistently above 140/90 mmHg could indicate hypertension, requiring further investigation. Similarly, your heart rate, typically measured in beats per minute (bpm), gives insights into your cardiovascular health. A resting heart rate between 60-100 bpm is generally considered normal.", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics. Your medical records are likely to contain a range of numerical data, from vital signs to lab results. For instance, your blood pressure might be recorded as one hundred and twenty over eighty M-M-H-G (millimeters of mercury), representing systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. A reading consistently above one hundred and forty over ninety M-M-H-G could indicate hypertension, requiring further investigation. Similarly, your heart rate, typically measured in beats per minute (B-P-M), gives insights into your cardiovascular health. A resting heart rate between sixty to one hundred B-P-M is generally considered normal."}
{"unnormalised": "Moving onto lab results, you'll encounter a variety of parameters. A complete blood count (CBC) will present numbers for red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. For example, a normal RBC count for females is typically 4.2-5.4 million/μL (microliters), while for males, it's 4.7-6.1 million/μL. Deviations from these ranges can indicate anemia or other underlying conditions. WBC counts, usually between 4,500-11,000/μL, are crucial for identifying infections.", "normalised": "Moving onto lab results, you'll encounter a variety of parameters. A complete blood count (C-B-C) will present numbers for red blood cells (R-B-C-s), white blood cells (W-B-C-s), and platelets. For example, a normal R-B-C count for females is typically four point two to five point four million per microliter, while for males, it's four point seven to six point one million per microliter. Deviations from these ranges can indicate anemia or other underlying conditions. W-B-C counts, usually between four thousand five hundred to eleven thousand per microliter, are crucial for identifying infections."}
{"unnormalised": "Cholesterol levels are another vital set of numbers to understand. Your report will likely show total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein, often called \"bad\" cholesterol), HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or \"good\" cholesterol), and triglycerides. An optimal LDL cholesterol level is usually below 100 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter), while an HDL level above 60 mg/dL is considered protective. Elevated triglycerides (above 150 mg/dL) can also increase your risk of heart disease.", "normalised": "Cholesterol levels are another vital set of numbers to understand. Your report will likely show total cholesterol, L-D-L (low-density lipoprotein, often called \"bad\" cholesterol), H-D-L (high-density lipoprotein, or \"good\" cholesterol), and triglycerides. An optimal L-D-L cholesterol level is usually below one hundred milligrams per deciliter, while an H-D-L level above sixty milligrams per deciliter is considered protective. Elevated triglycerides (above one hundred and fifty milligrams per deciliter) can also increase your risk of heart disease."}
{"unnormalised": "Understanding blood sugar levels is particularly important for individuals with diabetes or at risk of developing the condition. A fasting blood sugar level between 70-99 mg/dL is considered normal. A level between 100-125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, while a level of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests confirms a diagnosis of diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which reflects your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months, should ideally be below 5.7% for non-diabetics.", "normalised": "Understanding blood sugar levels is particularly important for individuals with diabetes or at risk of developing the condition. A fasting blood sugar level between seventy to ninety nine milligrams per deciliter is considered normal. A level between one hundred to one hundred and twenty five milligrams per deciliter indicates prediabetes, while a level of one hundred and twenty six milligrams per deciliter or higher on two separate tests confirms a diagnosis of diabetes. Hemoglobin A one c (H-B-A one c), which reflects your average blood sugar level over the past two to three months, should ideally be below five point seven percent for non-diabetics."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond these common metrics, your medical records might contain other specialized tests, depending on your health concerns. Liver function tests (LFTs), for instance, will provide numbers for enzymes like ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase), measured in units per liter (U/L). Elevated levels can suggest liver damage or inflammation. Kidney function tests will assess your creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, measured in mg/dL, indicating how well your kidneys are filtering waste products.", "normalised": "Beyond these common metrics, your medical records might contain other specialized tests, depending on your health concerns. Liver function tests (L-F-T-s), for instance, will provide numbers for enzymes like A-L-T (alanine aminotransferase) and A-S-T (aspartate aminotransferase), measured in units per liter (U slash L). Elevated levels can suggest liver damage or inflammation. Kidney function tests will assess your creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (B-U-N) levels, measured in milligrams per deciliter, indicating how well your kidneys are filtering waste products."}
{"unnormalised": "Imaging reports, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, also incorporate numerical data. These reports often include measurements of organ sizes, lesion dimensions, and other anatomical features. For example, a CT scan might reveal a nodule in the lung with a diameter of 1.5 cm (centimeters). These measurements help doctors monitor the progression of diseases and assess the effectiveness of treatments.", "normalised": "Imaging reports, such as X-rays, C-T scans, and M-R-I-s, also incorporate numerical data.

These measurements help doctors monitor the progression of diseases and assess the effectiveness of treatments."}
{"unnormalised": "Vaccination records are another important source of numbers. They document the dates and types of vaccinations you've received, such as MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), and influenza. Keeping track of your vaccination history ensures you're protected against preventable diseases and can easily provide this information to healthcare providers. The doses are often referred to as dose #1, dose #2 etc.", "normalised": "Vaccination records are another important source of numbers.
