{"unnormalised": "One significant area of concern is the representation of age in patient records. While some records may denote age in whole years (e.g., \"Age: 45\"), others might use fractional years (e.g., \"Age: 45.5\") or even months for infants (e.g., \"Age: 6 months\"). Furthermore, the unit of measurement may not always be explicitly stated, leading to ambiguity. For example, a record simply stating \"Age: 5\" could refer to years, months, or even weeks in certain contexts. Standardization efforts must address these variations by establishing a consistent unit of measurement and a clear format for recording age-related information.", "normalised": "One significant area of concern is the representation of age in patient records.

{"unnormalised": "Laboratory results also present normalization challenges. Different labs may use varying units of measurement for the same analyte. For instance, blood glucose levels could be recorded in mg/dL (e.g., \"Glucose: 120 mg/dL\") or mmol/L (e.g., \"Glucose: 6.7 mmol/L\"). Similarly, creatinine levels may be expressed in mg/dL or μmol/L. Converting between these units requires accurate conversion factors, which may not always be readily available or consistently applied across different systems. The adoption of standardized units and terminologies, such as those defined by LOINC, is essential for ensuring data comparability.", "normalised": "Laboratory results also present normalization challenges. Different labs may use varying units of measurement for the same analyte. For instance, blood glucose levels could be recorded in milligrams per deciliter (for example, \"Glucose: one hundred and twenty milligrams per deciliter\") or millimoles per liter (for example, \"Glucose: six point seven millimoles per liter\"). Similarly, creatinine levels may be expressed in milligrams per deciliter or micromoles per liter.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, often exhibit variability in their recording formats. Blood pressure may be represented as \"120/80 mmHg\" or \"BP: 120/80\", while heart rate might be recorded as \"72 bpm\" or simply \"HR: 72\". Additionally, the presence of abbreviations and shorthand notations in medical records further complicates the normalization process. Terms like \"HbA1c: 6.5%\" or \"BMI: 25 kg/m^2\" require proper interpretation and standardization to ensure accurate data analysis.", "normalised": "Furthermore, vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, often exhibit variability in their recording formats. Blood pressure may be represented as \"one hundred and twenty slash eighty millimeters of mercury\" or \"B-P: one hundred and twenty slash eighty\", while heart rate might be recorded as \"seventy two beats per minute\" or simply \"H-R: seventy two\". Additionally, the presence of abbreviations and shorthand notations in medical records further complicates the normalization process.

{"unnormalised": "The financial aspects of healthcare also contribute to numerical data inconsistencies. Hospital bills and insurance claims often involve various numerical values, such as treatment costs, insurance coverage amounts, and co-payment amounts. These values may be expressed in different currency formats (e.g., \"Rs. 10000\" or \"INR 10000\") and may include additional details such as taxes and discounts. Normalizing these financial data elements is crucial for cost analysis, reimbursement processing, and healthcare resource planning. A value like '₹ 5,000' could be represented with or without the comma, which adds more complexity.", "normalised": "The financial aspects of healthcare also contribute to numerical data inconsistencies.
