{"unnormalised": "Healthcare in India is rapidly evolving, and with it, the way we manage patient information. While digitization offers numerous benefits, it also introduces a lot of unnormalized data. Think about it – different hospitals using different systems, doctors noting down observations in varying formats, and patients sharing their medical histories in their own unique ways. This leads to a veritable chaos of numbers, codes and abbreviations that need to be sorted out for effective healthcare delivery.", "normalised": "healthcare in India is rapidly evolving, and with it, the way we manage patient information. while digitization offers numerous benefits, it also introduces a lot of unnormalized data. think about it – different hospitals using different systems, doctors noting down observations in varying formats, and patients sharing their medical histories in their own unique ways. this leads to a veritable chaos of numbers, codes and abbreviations that need to be sorted out for effective healthcare delivery."}
{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest challenges lies in standardizing numerical data in medical records. Consider a patient's blood pressure reading: it might be recorded as \"120/80 mmHg,\" \"120 over 80,\" or even just \"120/80\". Similarly, a patient’s weight could be documented as 70 kg or 154 lbs. These variations, though seemingly minor, can create significant confusion when trying to analyze large datasets for research or public health initiatives. Imagine trying to track the prevalence of hypertension across a population when the data is formatted in so many different ways!", "normalised": "one of the biggest challenges lies in standardizing numerical data in medical records. consider a patient's blood pressure reading: it might be recorded as \"one hundred and twenty divided by eighty m-m H-g,\" \"one hundred and twenty over eighty,\" or even just \"one hundred and twenty divided by eighty\". similarly, a patient’s weight could be documented as seventy kilogram or one hundred and fifty four pounds. these variations, though seemingly minor, can create significant confusion when trying to analyze large datasets for research or public health initiatives. imagine trying to track the prevalence of hypertension across a population when the data is formatted in so many different ways!"}
{"unnormalised": "Then there are the billing and insurance processes, which heavily rely on standardized coding systems like ICD-10. However, even within these systems, there's room for variation. A diagnosis might be recorded as \"I10\" in one hospital and \"Hypertension, essential\" in another. The cost of a procedure might be listed as Rs. 5000 in one bill and ₹5,000.00 in another.

{"unnormalised": "Lab results present another area ripe for unnormalized data. Values for blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and other key indicators might be expressed in different units, such as mg/dL or mmol/L. A normal HbA1c level could be noted as 6.5% or 0.065.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, addressing this challenge of unnormalized numerical data requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes adopting standardized data entry protocols, investing in robust data normalization tools, and training healthcare professionals on the importance of data quality. Furthermore, promoting interoperability between different healthcare systems is crucial to ensure that patient information can be seamlessly shared and analyzed across different providers. Only then can we unlock the full potential of healthcare data and improve patient outcomes in India.", "normalised": "ultimately, addressing this challenge of unnormalized numerical data requires a multi-pronged approach. this includes adopting standardized data entry protocols, investing in robust data normalization tools, and training healthcare professionals on the importance of data quality. furthermore, promoting interoperability between different healthcare systems is crucial to ensure that patient information can be seamlessly shared and analyzed across different providers. only then can we unlock the full potential of healthcare data and improve patient outcomes in India."}
