Those numbers, codes, and percentages can be super confusing. But understanding them is actually empowering. It helps you take charge of your health and communicate better with your doctors.

{"unnormalised": "First off, think about your blood pressure. You'll often see something like 120/80 mmHg. The top number (systolic) represents the pressure when your heart beats, and the bottom number (diastolic) is the pressure when your heart rests between beats. Aim for those lower numbers, folks! High BP can be a silent killer. Speaking of, my last reading was a tad high at 135/85 mmHg! Gotta cut down on the samosas, I guess.", "normalised": "First off, think about your blood pressure.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the world of lab results. You might see things like \"Cholesterol: 220 mg/dL\" or \"HbA1c: 7.2%.\" Cholesterol levels should ideally be under 200 mg/dL. That HbA1c, which reflects average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months, should be below 6.5% if you don't have diabetes. For diabetics, the target will be given by your doctor. Remember, these are just general guidelines. Your doctor will interpret them based on your individual health profile.", "normalised": "Then there's the world of lab results.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s talk about medical billing codes. These are standardized codes used to bill insurance companies and understand what procedures you've had. You might see something like \"ICD-10: E11.9\" which could indicate type 2 diabetes without complications. Or “CPT: 99214” which is a code for an office visit. Honestly, these can be a real maze. Don't hesitate to ask the billing department at your hospital (like AIIMS or Apollo) to explain them.", "normalised": "Now, let’s talk about medical billing codes.

{"unnormalised": "Hospital stays are a whirlwind, and those discharge summaries are packed with numbers. Pay attention to things like your heart rate (beats per minute or BPM) and oxygen saturation (SpO2 percentage). A normal resting heart rate is generally between 60-100 BPM. And your SpO2 should ideally be above 95%.", "normalised": "Hospital stays are a whirlwind, and those discharge summaries are packed with numbers.

And your S-p-O two should ideally be above ninety five percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Dates are another crucial element. Your medical history relies heavily on tracking dates – when symptoms started, when tests were performed, when medications were prescribed. You might see dates written as 15/07/2024 or 07/15/2024, depending on the format. Keep a record of your appointments, vaccination dates (like your COVID-19 booster on 23/11/2024), and when you started taking any new medications.", "normalised": "Dates are another crucial element.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, dosages! Pay VERY close attention to the dosage of any medications you're taking. You might see something like \"Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day\" or \"Vitamin D 1000 IU daily.\" Don't mix them up and don't self-medicate!

{"unnormalised": "So, there you have it! A little peek behind the curtain of numbers in your medical records. It can seem daunting, but breaking it down piece by piece makes it much easier to understand. Remember, you are your best advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, clarify doubts, and take an active role in managing your health. And if all else fails, just blame the numbers on the monsoon humidity – that's my excuse for everything! 😉", "normalised": "So, there you have it!
