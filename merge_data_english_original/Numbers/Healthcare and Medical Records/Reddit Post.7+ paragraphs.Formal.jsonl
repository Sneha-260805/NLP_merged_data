{"unnormalised": "The use of numerical identifiers is pervasive. Aadhar numbers are increasingly being linked to medical records in some instances, creating a unified patient profile across disparate healthcare providers. For example, a patient with Aadhar number 1234-5678-9012 might have records spread across AIIMS Delhi, Apollo Chennai, and a local clinic in Guwahati. Managing these records efficiently requires robust indexing and data retrieval systems. However, the ethical concerns regarding the use of Aadhar are vast and far-reaching, especially concerning privacy.", "normalised": "The use of numerical identifiers is pervasive.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, within the records themselves, numerical data abounds. Lab reports detail values like HbA1c (e.g., 7.2%), blood pressure (e.g., 120/80 mmHg), and cholesterol levels (e.g., 200 mg/dL). These figures are essential for diagnosis and treatment, but their consistency and accuracy are paramount. Inter-lab variability, different units of measurement (e.g., mg/dL vs. mmol/L), and transcription errors can all lead to discrepancies that negatively impact patient care.", "normalised": "Furthermore, within the records themselves, numerical data abounds.

{"unnormalised": "Prescriptions also heavily rely on numbers. Dosage instructions like \"Take 2 tablets thrice daily\" or \"Administer 5ml every 8 hours\" are commonplace. Ambiguity in these instructions, coupled with variations in drug concentrations (e.g., Paracetamol 500mg vs. Paracetamol 650mg), can lead to medication errors, especially in a country with diverse literacy levels and language barriers.", "normalised": "Prescriptions also heavily rely on numbers.

{"unnormalised": "Costing and billing are also key areas involving numerous data points. A single hospital visit can generate bills with line items for consultation fees (e.g., Rs. 500), diagnostic tests (e.g., MRI: Rs. 8000), medication charges (e.g., Rs. 250), and room rent (e.g., Rs. 2000 per day). The accurate and transparent representation of these costs is crucial for patient trust and affordability, especially considering the out-of-pocket expenditure in Indian healthcare.", "normalised": "Costing and billing are also key areas involving numerous data points. A single hospital visit can generate bills with line items for consultation fees (e.g., rupees five hundred), diagnostic tests (e.g., M-R-I: rupees eight thousand), medication charges (e.g., rupees two hundred fifty), and room rent (e.g., rupees two thousand per day).

{"unnormalised": "The age demographic is a critical variable that can sometimes be left out of digital records, or only captured in unhelpful numerical forms. For instance, patient age is often denoted in years (e.g., 65 yrs), the implications of this variable are diverse and can mean the difference between a prescription that will work vs. one that harms the patient.", "normalised": "The age demographic is a critical variable that can sometimes be left out of digital records, or only captured in unhelpful numerical forms.

Analyzing aggregated data (e.g., the prevalence of diabetes at 10% in urban areas) can inform policy decisions and resource allocation. However, maintaining patient privacy and data security during these analyses remains a significant challenge.
