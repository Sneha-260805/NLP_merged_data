{"unnormalised": "Alright folks, let's talk numbers. Not lottery numbers (though wouldn’t that be nice!), but those delightful digits that adorn your healthcare bills. Specifically, the ones that make you question if you accidentally bought a small private island instead of just getting your annual check-up. Let's be honest, decoding a medical bill is like trying to understand why your auto-rickshaw driver quoted you Rs. 300 for a ride that Google Maps says is 5 km. Pure magic (and a little bit daylight robbery!).", "normalised": "Alright folks, let's talk numbers.
