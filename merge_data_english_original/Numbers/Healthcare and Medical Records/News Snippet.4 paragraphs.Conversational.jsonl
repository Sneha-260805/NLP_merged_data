{"unnormalised": "Okay, so there's buzz about how our medical records are going digital, right? The govt. is pushing for it, saying it'll make things easier. But here's the thing – data privacy. Specifically regarding the new UIDAI-linked health IDs. Like, what happens to all that sensitive info, you know? Your medical history, prescriptions (like that time Dr. Sharma prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg), test results (even stuff like blood sugar levels showing 180 mg/dL), all that stuff stored online.", "normalised": "Okay, so there is buzz about how our medical records are going digital, right?

{"unnormalised": "Recently, a report showed that roughly 65% of Indians are concerned about data breaches. Remember that time the AIIMS Delhi server was hacked? It took weeks to recover, and that involved compromised health data for around 40 lakh patients. Plus, there's talk that insurance companies might use this data to hike premiums. Think about it, if they see you've got a pre-existing condition, suddenly your premium jumps by, say, 15%.", "normalised": "Recently, a report showed that roughly sixty five percent of Indians are concerned about data breaches.

{"unnormalised": "The worry isn't just hackers though. It's also about data being shared with, say, pharmaceutical companies for marketing purposes. Imagine getting ads for a specific medicine because your record shows you have diabetes. Nobody wants that, right? The government promises data protection laws, but people are still skeptical. They want more transparency and a clearer picture of how their data is being used, how long it will be stored (5 yrs? 10?), and who has access to it.", "normalised": "The worry is not just hackers though.

For example, you could book an appointment online with Dr. Patel in Mumbai for 10:30 AM. But it's crucial to address these privacy concerns before we fully embrace digital health records. Otherwise, we might be trading convenience for something much more valuable: our personal data security.", "normalised": "Basically, digitizing healthcare is a good idea in theory.
