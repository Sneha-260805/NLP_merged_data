{"unnormalised": "It all started subtly, with a persistent cough and a nagging fatigue I couldn’t shake off. I brushed it aside, attributing it to the Delhi pollution, the stress of work, and the general hustle of everyday life. After all, 12-hour workdays were the norm, and I wasn't exactly prioritizing my well-being. It took my wife, Priya, noticing I was losing weight – I’d dropped from 75 kg to roughly 68 kg in what felt like a blink – for me to finally take it seriously.", "normalised": "It all started subtly, with a persistent cough and a nagging fatigue I couldn’t shake off.

{"unnormalised": "My first visit was to Dr. Sharma, a general physician near our home in Dwarka. He listened patiently, took my vitals (BP: 130/85, Temp: 99°F), and ordered a battery of tests.

The prospect of understanding what they all meant was overwhelming.", "normalised": "My first visit was to Doctor Sharma, a general physician near our home in Dwarka.

{"unnormalised": "The blood test report arrived two days later. My hemoglobin was low at 11.5 g/dL. My erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was alarmingly high, hitting 45 mm/hr. And the lymphocytes were registering at a hefty 45%, hinting at possible inflammation. I frantically googled each value. Bad idea. I convinced myself I had something truly awful.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Kapoor, a pulmonologist at Max Hospital, reviewed the reports and ordered a chest X-ray. The X-ray revealed a shadow in my left lung. A CT scan followed, confirming the presence of a mass. My world felt like it was crumbling. He mentioned staging, survival rates, and terms like \"biopsy\" and \"chemotherapy.\" A whirlwind of anxiety descended. I couldn't sleep. I lost my appetite, even though Priya made my favorite Palak Paneer. I'm grateful that she suggested I join a support group for cancer patients.", "normalised": "Doctor Kapoor, a pulmonologist at Max Hospital, reviewed the reports and ordered a chest X-ray.

{"unnormalised": "The chemotherapy was a brutal ordeal, spread across 6 cycles, each lasting 21 days. Nausea, fatigue, hair loss – it was everything I had read about, and more. I lost another 5 kg during the treatment. However, the PET scan after the 4th cycle showed a significant reduction in the size of the tumor. The oncologist said there had been an approximately 70% reduction in tumour size.", "normalised": "The chemotherapy was a brutal ordeal, spread across six cycles, each lasting twenty one days.

{"unnormalised": "Recovery has been slow but steady. My energy levels are gradually returning. Priya makes sure I eat nutritious food. It's been a long journey filled with numbers – test results, percentages, dates, weights. But these numbers, while initially terrifying, helped me understand my health. My next check up with Dr. Kapoor is on 15/01/2025, and I'm hoping for good news. I'm also looking forward to my next visit with the support group. This experience has taught me the importance of early detection, listening to your body, and the unwavering support of loved ones.
