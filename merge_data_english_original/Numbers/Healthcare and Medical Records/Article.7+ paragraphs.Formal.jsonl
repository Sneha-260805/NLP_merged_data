{"unnormalised": "One significant area involves the representation of patient demographics. Age is frequently recorded in years (e.g., 65 yrs, 28 years old), while weight is documented in kilograms (kgs) or, less commonly, pounds (lbs). Height may appear in centimeters (cms) or feet and inches (e.g., 5’8”).

{"unnormalised": "Medical test results constitute another critical set of numerical data. Blood glucose levels are typically expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with normal fasting levels often falling between 70-100 mg/dL. Blood pressure is recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), with values such as 120/80 mmHg considered optimal. Cholesterol levels, including LDL and HDL, are also crucial indicators of cardiovascular health, with target ranges defined by guidelines.
