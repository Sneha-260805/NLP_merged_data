{"unnormalised": "Hey, I saw your post about medical bills. Just wanted to say, always double-check the numbers. My bill had charges for 2 MRI scans when I only had 1! And they billed me Rs. 8000 extra for a \"consultation\" I never got. Luckily, after 3 calls and emailing them my UHID number, they corrected it. Saved me a cool Rs. 10,000. So yeah, verify every single number!", "normalised": "Hey, I saw your post about medical bills. Just wanted to say, always double check the numbers.
