{"unnormalised": "Consider a scenario where a patient, Mr. Rajesh Kumar, visits a clinic in Mumbai. His medical history contains entries like \"BP: 140/90 mmHg,\" \"HbA1c: 7.2%,\" and \"Weight: 75 kg.\" These numbers, while seemingly straightforward, can be recorded differently across various healthcare providers, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors. The \"BP\" reading, for example, might be documented as \"140/90,\" \"140 over 90,\" or even \"140 slash 90.\"", "normalised": "Consider a scenario where a patient, Mister Rajesh Kumar, visits a clinic in Mumbai.

{"unnormalised": "The challenge extends beyond individual patient records. At the national level, epidemiological data relies heavily on accurate and consistent numerical reporting. Imagine a survey on diabetes prevalence across different states. Data collected might include \"20% in Kerala,\" \"18.5% in Tamil Nadu,\" and \"0.15 crore cases in Maharashtra.\" These figures, while valuable, need careful normalization to ensure accurate comparisons and effective resource allocation. The \"0.15 crore\" figure must be converted to its decimal representation (1,500,000) to compare with percentage data.", "normalised": "The challenge extends beyond individual patient records.

{"unnormalised": "Further complicating the situation is the prevalence of regional variations and units of measurement. In some rural areas, weight might be recorded in \"seer\" instead of kilograms, while height could be expressed in \"feet and inches\" rather than meters or centimeters. A child's growth chart may contain entries like \"Height: 3 ft 6 in\" or \"Weight: 20 kg,\" requiring conversion to a standardized format for analysis and comparison against national benchmarks.", "normalised": "Further complicating the situation is the prevalence of regional variations and units of measurement.

{"unnormalised": "The integration of technology into Indian healthcare is also generating new sources of numerical data. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain vast amounts of information, including lab results, medication dosages, and appointment schedules.
