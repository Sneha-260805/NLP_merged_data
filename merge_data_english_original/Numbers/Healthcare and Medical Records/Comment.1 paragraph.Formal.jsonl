{"unnormalised": "Regarding the recent article about digitizing healthcare records, I believe it's crucial to address the normalization of numerical data. While the implementation of systems like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is commendable, inconsistencies in data entry, such as representing patient age as '27 yrs' in one record and '27 years' or simply '27' in another, pose a significant challenge. Similarly, height might be recorded as '175cm' or '1.75m', requiring standardization. Clear guidelines and automated normalization processes are essential for accurate analysis, considering data from sources like district hospitals and private clinics across India, where the patient count can exceed 100000 annually.", "normalised": "Regarding the recent article about digitizing healthcare records, I believe it's crucial to address the normalization of numerical data.
