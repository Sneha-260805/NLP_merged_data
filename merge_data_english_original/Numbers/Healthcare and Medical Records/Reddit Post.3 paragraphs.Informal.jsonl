{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, anyone else feel like deciphering medical bills is a Herculean task? My grandma just got a bill after her checkup at Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai, and it's a total mess of numbers! Like, one line says \"Consultation Fee: ₹1500,\" okay, makes sense. But then there's \"Misc. Charges: 278.45 INR\" and another \"Lab Tests: 3,500/-\". What even *is* misc charges?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, anyone else feel like deciphering medical bills is a Herculean task?

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on the medical records themselves. Dr. Shah's notes are like some secret code! I can barely read them.

{"unnormalised": "It's all so opaque. I wish there was a standardized format or something. Imagine if every hospital used the same codes and measurements. I mean, my ECG charge was ₹800.00 but my friend in Delhi had to pay Rs. 1200 at Max Healthcare. Maybe this sounds like a rant, but it's so frustrating to deal with all these numbers and codes when you're already worried about your loved one's health. Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips on how to make sense of it all?", "normalised": "It is all so opaque. I wish there was a standardized format or something. Imagine if every hospital used the same codes and measurements.
