{"unnormalised": "One of the most basic forms of numerical data involves patient demographics. Age, often recorded as a whole number (e.g., 62), is a key factor influencing treatment decisions. Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated using weight and height measurements (e.g., weight in kg / (height in meters)^2), provides a valuable indicator of overall health status, often presented to 2 decimal places (e.g., 27.54). Both of these figures are usually recorded upon admission or during initial consultations.", "normalised": "One of the most basic forms of numerical data involves patient demographics. Age, often recorded as a whole number (e.g., sixty two), is a key factor influencing treatment decisions.

{"unnormalised": "Vital signs constitute another essential category of numerical data. Blood pressure, expressed as systolic/diastolic (e.g., 120/80 mmHg), indicates cardiovascular health. Heart rate, measured in beats per minute (bpm), provides insights into cardiac function (e.g., 72 bpm). Body temperature, typically recorded in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 37°C or 98.6°F), is a critical indicator of infection or inflammation. Respiratory rate, usually documented as breaths per minute (e.g., 16 breaths/min), assists in assessing pulmonary health. Variations in these numbers can alert the medical team, such as a drop in BP below 90/60 or a sudden spike in temperature to 102°F.", "normalised": "Vital signs constitute another essential category of numerical data. Blood pressure, expressed as systolic divided by diastolic (e.g., one hundred and twenty divided by eighty millimeter of mercury), indicates cardiovascular health. Heart rate, measured in beats per minute (B-P-M), provides insights into cardiac function (e.g., seventy two B-P-M). Body temperature, typically recorded in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., thirty seven degree celsius or ninety eight point six degree fahrenheit), is a critical indicator of infection or inflammation. Respiratory rate, usually documented as breaths per minute (e.g., sixteen breaths per minute), assists in assessing pulmonary health. Variations in these numbers can alert the medical team, such as a drop in B-P below ninety divided by sixty or a sudden spike in temperature to one hundred and two degree fahrenheit."}
{"unnormalised": "Diagnostic test results generate a wealth of numerical data. Blood glucose levels, measured in mg/dL (e.g., 95 mg/dL), are vital for managing diabetes. Cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL, also measured in mg/dL (e.g., Total Cholesterol: 200 mg/dL), assess cardiovascular risk. Complete blood count (CBC) reports include numerous parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb) levels in g/dL (e.g., Hb: 14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count in cells/µL (e.g., WBC: 7000 cells/µL), and platelet count in cells/µL (e.g., Platelets: 250000 cells/µL). Radiology reports often include measurements of tumor size in cm (e.g., Tumor size: 3.5 cm).", "normalised": "Diagnostic test results generate a wealth of numerical data.

Cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol, H-D-L, and L-D-L, also measured in milligram per deciliter (e.g., Total Cholesterol: two hundred milligram per deciliter), assess cardiovascular risk. Complete blood count (C-B-C) reports include numerous parameters such as hemoglobin (H-B) levels in gram per deciliter (e.g., H-B: fourteen point five gram per deciliter), white blood cell (W-B-C) count in cells per microliter (e.g., W-B-C: seven thousand cells per microliter), and platelet count in cells per microliter (e.g., Platelets: two hundred and fifty thousand cells per microliter).

Dosages are typically expressed in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (mcg) (e.g., Amoxicillin 500mg, Thyroxine 25mcg). Frequency of administration is also numerically quantified (e.g., twice daily or TDS, every 8 hours or Q8H). Intravenous (IV) fluid infusion rates are measured in milliliters per hour (mL/hr) (e.g., IV fluids at 100 mL/hr). Careful attention to these numbers is essential to prevent medication errors.", "normalised": "Medication dosages and administration details involve precise numerical data.

Epidemiological studies rely on statistical analysis of numerical data to identify risk factors and disease patterns.
