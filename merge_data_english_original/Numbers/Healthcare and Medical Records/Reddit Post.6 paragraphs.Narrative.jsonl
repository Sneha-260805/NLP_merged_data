My grandma, God bless her, had to get admitted to a local hospital in Guwahati for a knee replacement. We chose this hospital cos their knee replacement package was advertised at Rs. 1,50,000. Sounded reasonable, right?", "normalised": "Hey Reddit fam, just wanted to share a recent experience with the whole medical billing system here in India, and honestly, it's a bit of a rollercoaster.

They charged Rs. 500 for a single tablet of some painkiller (I swear, the same thing costs Rs. 50 at the local pharmacy!), and the physiotherapy sessions were billed at Rs. 2000 per session – and she needed, like, 10 of those! And don’t even get me started on the bed charges. Rs. 3000/day for a regular room? That’s highway robbery!", "normalised": "Seriously, it was longer than a Bollywood movie's runtime.

{"unnormalised": "The worst part? The insurance company only covered 60% of the inflated bill. Turns out, there were all sorts of \"sub-limits\" and \"exclusions\" we didn’t know about.

Anyone else experienced similar issues with medical billing here? Any tips on how to navigate this maze of charges and hidden costs? Seriously need some guidance before my next hospital visit… for anything.", "normalised": "Ended up paying almost forty percent of the original bill amount out of pocket.
