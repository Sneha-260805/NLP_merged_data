They tell a story, a numerical narrative of your body's journey. So, grab a cup of chai, settle in, and let's decode some of these healthcare numbers together!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "First up, let's talk about that all-important blood pressure reading. You know, the one where the doc rattles off something like \"120 over 80\"? That's usually written as 120/80 mmHg. The top number, the systolic, tells you the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom, diastolic, is the pressure when your heart rests between beats. Ideally, you wanna aim for below 120/80 mmHg. Higher than that, and you might be in hypertension territory!", "normalised": "First up, let's talk about that all-important blood pressure reading.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's cholesterol. You'll see things like Total Cholesterol, LDL, and HDL on your blood work. Think of them like characters in a Bollywood movie. LDL is the villain (bad cholesterol), aiming for less than 100 mg/dL is good. HDL is the hero (good cholesterol), and ideally, you'd want that above 60 mg/dL. Total cholesterol, you wanna keep that under 200 mg/dL.", "normalised": "Then there's cholesterol. You'll see things like Total Cholesterol, L-D-L, and H-D-L on your blood work.

H-D-L is the hero (good cholesterol), and ideally, you'd want that above sixty milligrams per d-L. Total cholesterol, you wanna keep that under two hundred milligrams per d-L."}
{"unnormalised": "Blood sugar levels are another crucial number. If you're diabetic or pre-diabetic, you're probably already familiar. A normal fasting blood sugar is usually below 100 mg/dL. After eating, it should ideally be below 140 mg/dL 2 hrs post meal. A1c, which gives an average over 3 months, should be under 5.7% for non-diabetics. These numbers help manage your diet and medications.", "normalised": "Blood sugar levels are another crucial number. If you're diabetic or pre-diabetic, you're probably already familiar. A normal fasting blood sugar is usually below one hundred milligrams per d-L. After eating, it should ideally be below one hundred and forty milligrams per d-L two hours post meal. A one c, which gives an average over three months, should be under five point seven percent for non-diabetics. These numbers help manage your diet and medications."}
{"unnormalised": "And what about BMI, or Body Mass Index? It's a quick and easy way to estimate whether you're at a healthy weight for your height. The formula is weight (kg) / [height (m)]^2. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal. Over 25, you might be considered overweight, and over 30, obese. However, BMI isn't perfect, as it doesn't account for muscle mass.", "normalised": "And what about B-M-I, or Body Mass Index? It's a quick and easy way to estimate whether you're at a healthy weight for your height. The formula is weight (kilogram) divided by height (meter) squared. A B-M-I between eighteen point five and twenty four point nine is considered normal. Over twenty five, you might be considered overweight, and over thirty, obese. However, B-M-I isn't perfect, as it doesn't account for muscle mass."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there are the more specific tests. If you had a complete blood count, or CBC, you'd see things like RBC (red blood cell count), WBC (white blood cell count), and platelets. Normal ranges vary, but generally, you want your RBC count to be within 4.5 to 5.5 million cells/mcL (for men) and 4.0 to 5.0 million cells/mcL (for women). WBC usually range from 4,500 to 11,000 cells/mcL, and platelets from 150,000 to 450,000 per mcL.", "normalised": "Then there are the more specific tests. If you had a complete blood count, or C-B-C, you'd see things like R-B-C (red blood cell count), W-B-C (white blood cell count), and platelets. Normal ranges vary, but generally, you want your R-B-C count to be within four point five to five point five million cells per m-c-L (for men) and four point zero to five point zero million cells per m-c-L (for women). W-B-C usually range from four thousand five hundred to eleven thousand cells per m-c-L, and platelets from one hundred and fifty thousand to four hundred and fifty thousand per m-c-L."}
{"unnormalised": "Speaking of scans, let’s talk about dosages. If you had an X-ray or CT scan, you'll see terms like mSv, which stands for millisieverts. That's the unit used to measure radiation exposure. While medical imaging is super helpful, too much radiation isn't good. That’s why doctors carefully consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Remember, discuss any concerns with your physician.", "normalised": "Speaking of scans, let’s talk about dosages.
