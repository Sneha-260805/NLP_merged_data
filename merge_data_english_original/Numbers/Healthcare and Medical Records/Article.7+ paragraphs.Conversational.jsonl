{"unnormalised": "First off, consider the cost of healthcare itself. According to a recent report by the WHO, out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare in India is around 60%. That's a significant chunk! It means we're paying a hefty amount directly for our medical needs, unlike countries with more robust public healthcare systems. This affects how families plan their finances, especially when unexpected health issues arise. Imagine a family in Guwahati needing to find Rs. 50,000 for an emergency surgery. That's a huge hit.", "normalised": "First off, consider the cost of healthcare itself.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of insurance. While health insurance penetration is growing, only around 34% of Indians are covered. This means a large number of people are vulnerable to financial shocks when they get sick. Remember Sharmaji from next door? He had to sell his land after his bypass surgery cost him ₹2.5 lakh. That's the reality for many. Govt initiatives like Ayushman Bharat are trying to improve this, aiming to cover 50 crore people, but there's still a long way to go.", "normalised": "Then there is the issue of insurance. While health insurance penetration is growing, only around thirty four percent of Indians are covered. This means a large number of people are vulnerable to financial shocks when they get sick.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about medical records. Each patient has a unique Medical Record Number (MRN), a seemingly simple string of digits, often something like 1234567890. This number links all your medical history – consultations, test results, prescriptions – to you. Then consider lab reports. A typical blood test might include results like Haemoglobin: 13.5 g/dL (normal range 12-16), or Blood Sugar Fasting: 95 mg/dL (normal <100). These numbers are critical for diagnosing and monitoring health conditions. But understanding these can be tricky, right? \"My creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, is that high, doctor?\" is a common question I hear.", "normalised": "Now, let us talk about medical records.

{"unnormalised": "The numbers don't stop there. Hospital bed occupancy rates are another crucial indicator. Hospitals aim for an occupancy rate of around 85%, indicating efficient use of resources. This also affects wait times. Think about it – if Apollo Hospital in Chennai has a 95% occupancy rate, getting a bed for your relative might take longer. Emergency rooms are also full of numbers. Triage systems assign numbers based on urgency: 1 for critical, 5 for minor. A level 1 patient needs immediate attention, impacting how quickly everyone else is seen.", "normalised": "The numbers do not stop there. Hospital bed occupancy rates are another crucial indicator.

Understanding these numbers, even at a basic level, empowers us to make informed decisions about our health and advocate for better healthcare access for everyone in India.
