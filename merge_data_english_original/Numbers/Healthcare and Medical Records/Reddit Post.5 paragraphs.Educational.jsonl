{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts on how numbers play a HUGE role in healthcare, especially when we're talking about medical records. It's not just about the doctor's appointment at 10 AM or needing 2 doses of medication, it's far more intricate than that. Numbers are the backbone of so much of what goes on behind the scenes to keep us healthy.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts on how numbers play a huge role in healthcare, especially when we're talking about medical records.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: every patient has a unique MRN, like a roll number in college (e.g., MRN: 123456789). That number is linked to everything - lab results, like a blood sugar reading of 120 mg/dL, or a cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL. These aren't just random figures; they're crucial pieces of a complex puzzle that doctors use to diagnose and treat us. They track progress, monitor side effects from a medication like metformin 500mg, and adjust treatment plans.", "normalised": "Think about it: every patient has a unique M-R-N, like a roll number in college (e.g., M-R-N: one hundred twenty three million four hundred fifty six thousand seven hundred eighty nine).

Research papers quote things like a study involving 500 participants, where 65% showed improvement.
