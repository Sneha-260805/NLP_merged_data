And for some older records, you might even find 23-July-88. Imagine the confusion when tracking medical history, especially if the patient is elderly and there's a need to cross-reference multiple records created over decades! It's a nightmare for the doctors and nurses trying to get a clear picture of a patient’s health trajectory.

{"unnormalised": "The solution? Standardized digital record-keeping. Every hospital and clinic should adopt a uniform format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD), phone numbers (+91 followed by the 10-digit number), vitals (using universally recognized units), and currency (INR).
