{"unnormalised": "First off, think about your regular check-up. Your blood pressure might read something like 120/80 mmHg – those are numbers dictating the force of blood against your artery walls! Then there’s your heart rate, maybe 72 bpm, telling doctors how many times your heart beats in a minute. And, of course, your temperature: 98.6°F (or around 37°C if you’re going the metric route) is generally considered normal. These numbers provide a snapshot of your overall health right then and there. Even the simple act of counting calories, maybe around 2000 kcal per day, relates to your overall well-being.", "normalised": "First off, think about your regular check-up. Your blood pressure might read something like one hundred and twenty over eighty millimeters of mercury – those are numbers dictating the force of blood against your artery walls! Then there’s your heart rate, maybe seventy two beats per minute, telling doctors how many times your heart beats in a minute. And, of course, your temperature: ninety eight point six degrees Fahrenheit (or around thirty seven degrees Celsius if you’re going the metric route) is generally considered normal. These numbers provide a snapshot of your overall health right then and there. Even the simple act of counting calories, maybe around two thousand kilocalories per day, relates to your overall well-being."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s talk medical records. Your prescription for, say, Amoxicillin 250mg, is a string of numbers representing the dosage and strength of the medication. Your blood test results are a numeric battlefield: your HbA1c might be 6.5% indicating pre-diabetes, or your cholesterol could be 200 mg/dL, a cause for concern. And let's not forget the report numbers: a CT scan at Apollo Hospital might show a 5mm nodule in the lung, requiring further observation. All these numbers, however small or large, paint a detailed picture of your medical history.", "normalised": "Now, let’s talk medical records.

Even the discounts on medicines, maybe 15% off at a local pharmacy, is all about numbers. Managing your medical finances involves understanding these figures and planning accordingly.
