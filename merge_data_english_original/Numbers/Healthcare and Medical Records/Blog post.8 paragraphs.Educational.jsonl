{"unnormalised": "First, let's consider some common numerical data you'll find. Your height and weight, measured in cm and kg respectively, are fundamental indicators of overall health. A Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.5, for example, might suggest you are overweight, prompting a discussion about diet and exercise. Your blood pressure, typically recorded as 120/80 mmHg, reveals the force of your blood against your artery walls. Variations outside the norm can indicate potential heart problems.", "normalised": "First, let's consider some common numerical data you'll find. Your height and weight, measured in centimeter and kilogram respectively, are fundamental indicators of overall health. A Body Mass Index (B-M-I) of twenty five point five, for example, might suggest you are overweight, prompting a discussion about diet and exercise. Your blood pressure, typically recorded as one hundred and twenty over eighty millimeter of mercury, reveals the force of your blood against your artery walls. Variations outside the norm can indicate potential heart problems."}
{"unnormalised": "Lab results are also rife with numbers. A blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL might suggest prediabetes, whereas a cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL could raise concerns about cardiovascular health. Your doctor will also look at your white blood cell count, say 7500 cells/mcL to assess your immune system function. Understanding these basic measurements is the first step in becoming an active participant in your own healthcare.", "normalised": "Lab results are also rife with numbers. A blood glucose level of one hundred and ten milligram per deciliter might suggest prediabetes, whereas a cholesterol level of two hundred and twenty milligram per deciliter could raise concerns about cardiovascular health. Your doctor will also look at your white blood cell count, say seven thousand five hundred cells per microliter to assess your immune system function. Understanding these basic measurements is the first step in becoming an active participant in your own healthcare."}
{"unnormalised": "Medication dosages are another crucial area where numbers play a vital role. A prescription for Amoxicillin 500mg, taken twice a day for 7 days, specifies the precise amount of medication needed to combat an infection. Similarly, insulin dosages for diabetes are carefully calibrated based on blood sugar levels, often using units such as 10U of Humalog before meals. Following these instructions meticulously is crucial for effective treatment and avoiding potential side effects.", "normalised": "Medication dosages are another crucial area where numbers play a vital role. A prescription for Amoxicillin five hundred milligram, taken twice a day for seven days, specifies the precise amount of medication needed to combat an infection. Similarly, insulin dosages for diabetes are carefully calibrated based on blood sugar levels, often using units such as ten U of Humalog before meals. Following these instructions meticulously is crucial for effective treatment and avoiding potential side effects."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond these common examples, numbers are used to track your progress over time. A chart showing your HbA1c level dropping from 8% to 6.5% indicates successful diabetes management. Tracking your weight loss journey in kgs, noting a decrease from 85 kg to 78 kg, can motivate you to stay on track. These numerical trends provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your treatment plans and lifestyle changes.", "normalised": "Beyond these common examples, numbers are used to track your progress over time. A chart showing your H-b-A-one-c level dropping from eight percent to six point five percent indicates successful diabetes management. Tracking your weight loss journey in kilograms, noting a decrease from eighty five kilogram to seventy eight kilogram, can motivate you to stay on track. These numerical trends provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your treatment plans and lifestyle changes."}
{"unnormalised": "Another important area is vaccination schedules. The Polio vaccine, often given in multiple doses, e.g. Dose 1 at birth, Dose 2 at 6 weeks, and Dose 3 at 14 weeks, has precise timing to ensure optimal immunity. Similarly, booster shots for Tetanus, typically recommended every 10 years, help maintain protection against the disease. Keeping track of these dates and dosages is essential for staying up-to-date on your vaccinations.", "normalised": "Another important area is vaccination schedules.

Keeping track of these dates and dosages is essential for staying up-to-date on your vaccinations."}
{"unnormalised": "Remember that these numbers should always be interpreted in the context of your individual health history and in consultation with your doctor. A slightly elevated cholesterol level might not be cause for concern if you have no other risk factors, whereas it could be a significant red flag for someone with a family history of heart disease. Your doctor will consider all the numerical data alongside your symptoms, lifestyle, and other factors to provide a comprehensive assessment and personalized treatment plan.", "normalised": "Remember that these numbers should always be interpreted in the context of your individual health history and in consultation with your doctor.
