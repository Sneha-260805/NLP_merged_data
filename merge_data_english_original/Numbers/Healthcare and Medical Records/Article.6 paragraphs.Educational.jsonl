{"unnormalised": "In the dynamic landscape of healthcare, numerical data plays a pivotal role in understanding disease prevalence, resource allocation, and public health interventions. Healthcare and medical records are replete with numbers, offering insights into patient demographics, diagnostic metrics, treatment efficacy, and epidemiological trends. A close look at these figures can help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the Indian healthcare system.", "normalised": "In the dynamic landscape of healthcare, numerical data plays a pivotal role in understanding disease prevalence, resource allocation, and public health interventions.

{"unnormalised": "One critical area where numbers are indispensable is in tracking disease prevalence. For instance, recent data from the National Health Mission indicates that approx. 30 million Indians suffer from diabetes, with an annual increase of around 1.5%. Similarly, the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant concern, with an estimated 2.64 million cases reported in 2022 according to the WHO. These numbers highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, such as early screening programs, improved access to treatment, and public awareness campaigns.", "normalised": "One critical area where numbers are indispensable is in tracking disease prevalence.

{"unnormalised": "Medical records themselves are treasure troves of numerical information. A typical patient file might contain details such as height (e.g., 175 cm), weight (e.g., 70 kg), blood pressure (e.g., 120/80 mmHg), and cholesterol levels (e.g., 200 mg/dL). These parameters are crucial for assessing a patient's overall health status, identifying risk factors, and monitoring treatment progress. Furthermore, the frequency of hospital visits (e.g., 3 visits per year) and the duration of hospital stays (e.g., 5 days) can provide insights into the utilization of healthcare services and the burden of specific diseases.", "normalised": "Medical records themselves are treasure troves of numerical information. A typical patient file might contain details such as height (e.g., one hundred and seventy five centimeter), weight (e.g., seventy kilogram), blood pressure (e.g., one hundred and twenty divided by eighty M-M H-G), and cholesterol levels (e.g., two hundred milligram per D-L). These parameters are crucial for assessing a patient's overall health status, identifying risk factors, and monitoring treatment progress.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond individual patient records, aggregated data from hospitals and clinics offers a broader perspective on healthcare trends. For example, a hospital might track the number of admissions for heart attacks (e.g., 500 admissions in 2023), the average length of stay for stroke patients (e.g., 7.2 days), and the mortality rate for various surgical procedures (e.g., 2% for coronary artery bypass grafting). This information is essential for quality improvement initiatives, resource planning, and benchmarking performance against other healthcare providers. A hospital might report that they performed 150 angioplasties in Q1 2024.", "normalised": "Beyond individual patient records, aggregated data from hospitals and clinics offers a broader perspective on healthcare trends.

A hospital might report that they performed one hundred and fifty angioplasties in Q one two thousand and twenty four."}
{"unnormalised": "Numbers also play a crucial role in pharmaceutical research and development. Clinical trials often involve hundreds or even thousands of patients, and the data collected from these trials is analyzed using statistical methods to determine the efficacy and safety of new drugs. For instance, a study might find that a new drug reduces blood sugar levels by an average of 20 mg/dL in patients with type 2 diabetes. Or a new vaccine may report 95% efficacy based on Phase 3 trial results. Such findings are essential for regulatory approval and for informing clinical practice guidelines.", "normalised": "Numbers also play a crucial role in pharmaceutical research and development.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, numerical data is an indispensable tool for understanding and improving healthcare in India. From tracking disease prevalence to monitoring patient outcomes, numbers provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making at all levels of the healthcare system. By harnessing the power of data analytics and promoting data literacy, we can work towards a healthier future for all Indians. We need to ensure we are keeping and maintaining accurate records to help manage health concerns in the future.", "normalised": "In conclusion, numerical data is an indispensable tool for understanding and improving healthcare in India.
