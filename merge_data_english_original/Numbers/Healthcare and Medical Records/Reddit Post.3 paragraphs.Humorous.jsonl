{"unnormalised": "Honestly, I feel like I just created a whole new medical history for her. If she suddenly starts craving different medicines, I'm blaming the hospital form. BTW, does anyone else find these online medical forms totally baffling? It's like they're trying to diagnose you *before* you even get to the hospital. Wish me luck, guys! Hopefully, Mom doesn't find out her weight and BP are now public knowledge... or at least, known to some underpaid data entry clerk.", "normalised": "Honestly, I feel like I just created a whole new medical history for her.
