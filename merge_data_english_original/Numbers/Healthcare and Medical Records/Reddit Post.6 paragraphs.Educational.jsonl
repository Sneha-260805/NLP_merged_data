{"unnormalised": "First, let’s talk about age. You’ll see things like “Pt. is 62 yrs old” or “Patient is 72 y.o.” in case files. While seemingly simple, imagine the confusion if some records use \"yrs\" and others \"y.o.\"! Consistency is key for data analysis and tracking age-related illnesses. Similarly, height and weight are crucial. You'll see them in cm and kg, like \"165cm\" or \"75 kg,\" sometimes with conversions to feet and pounds. But inconsistent formatting, like omitting the unit (just \"165\" or \"75\") or using different units (inches instead of cm), can throw off dosage calculations for meds. Imagine a med error because weight was misinterpreted.", "normalised": "First, let’s talk about age.

Also, think about lab results. You'll see tons of numbers with different units, such as \"HbA1c: 7.2%\" or \"Cholesterol: 200 mg/dL.\" These numbers are critical for diagnosis and monitoring, but variations in units or decimal places (\"7.2\" vs. \"7.20\") can lead to misinterpretations.", "normalised": "Then there's blood pressure, usually noted as systolic slash diastolic, like “one hundred and twenty divided by eighty millimeter of mercury.” Again, that “millimeter of mercury” is vital.
