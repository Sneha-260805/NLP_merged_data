{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit, wanted to share some thoughts on medical record keeping, especially how numbers play a HUGE role. It's more than just dates of appointments; there's a ton of numerical data that's crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Think about it: your blood pressure reading (e.g., 120/80), your weight (say, 75 kg), your cholesterol levels (maybe 200 mg/dL). These numbers, along with other vitals, create a numerical snapshot of your health at any given time. Plus, consider medication dosages like \"Take 500mg of paracetamol every 6 hrs\". These values directly impact treatment effectiveness and must be recorded precisely.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit, wanted to share some thoughts on medical record keeping, especially how numbers play a huge role. It's more than just dates of appointments; there's a ton of numerical data that's crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Think about it: your blood pressure reading (e.g., one hundred and twenty divided by eighty), your weight (say, seventy five kilogram), your cholesterol levels (maybe two hundred milligram per deciliter). These numbers, along with other vitals, create a numerical snapshot of your health at any given time. Plus, consider medication dosages like \"Take five hundred milligram of paracetamol every six hours\". These values directly impact treatment effectiveness and must be recorded precisely."}
{"unnormalised": "Now consider the sheer VOLUME of numbers in a comprehensive medical history. A patient with diabetes might have their blood sugar levels checked multiple times a day (e.g., 110 mg/dL before breakfast, 150 mg/dL after lunch). They might also track their insulin dosage (e.g., 20 units of insulin before dinner). And this goes on for YEARS. Healthcare providers rely heavily on these records and the numerical data contained within to track disease progression, adjust treatments, and make informed decisions. Imagine trying to treat someone with diabetes without knowing their HbA1c level (e.g. 7.2%) from the past 6 months. That's why consistent and precise record-keeping is vital.", "normalised": "Now consider the sheer volume of numbers in a comprehensive medical history.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, let's not forget about the administrative side of things. Every patient has a unique medical record number (MRN), often a string of digits like 123456789. Hospitals track admissions, discharges, and procedures using numerical codes (e.g., ICD-10 codes). Billing and insurance also heavily rely on numbers. Think about claim amounts (Rs. 5000 for a consultation), policy numbers (e.g., a policy with number 987654321), and reimbursement rates (e.g., 80% coverage).
