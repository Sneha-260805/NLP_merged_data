{"unnormalised": "Think about it. When you go to a hospital like AIIMS or a local clinic, your medical history, test results, and treatment plans are all recorded. These records are filled with numbers – things like blood pressure readings (e.g., 120/80 mmHg), cholesterol levels (maybe 200 mg/dL), or HbA1c results for diabetes management (like 7.2%). Even something as simple as your weight (say 70 kg) or height (175 cm) is crucial information.", "normalised": "Think about it.

{"unnormalised": "But what if those numbers aren't clear or consistent? Imagine a doctor quickly scanning a report and misreading a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL as 12 mg/dL because of poor handwriting or a typo. The consequences could be pretty serious, leading to incorrect diagnoses or inappropriate treatments. Similarly, lab results may vary their reporting based on the lab performing the tests. One may report potassium levels as 4.5 mEq/L while another may report it as 4.5 mmol/L. This leads to additional burden on the clinicians to normalize the values.", "normalised": "But what if those numbers aren't clear or consistent?

{"unnormalised": "Another issue is the lack of a unified format. Some records might use the international standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD), while others use the Indian format (DD/MM/YYYY). A prescription might say \"take 1 tablet twice a day\" without specifying the exact dosage (e.g., 500mg). This ambiguity can be confusing for patients, especially older folks who might not be familiar with medical jargon. Even age can be represented differently - sometimes in years (65 yrs), sometimes just as '65'. Standardizing this would really help.", "normalised": "Another issue is the lack of a unified format.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do? I think advocating for standardized digital medical records is key.
