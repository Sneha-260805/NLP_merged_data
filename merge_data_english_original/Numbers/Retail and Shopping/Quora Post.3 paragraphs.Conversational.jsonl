For a small family (say, 2 adults and 1 child) in a metro city like Mumbai or Delhi, you're probably looking at Rs. 8000-Rs. 12000 per month. That's if you're buying from local markets and D-Mart.

{"unnormalised": "The biggest chunk of that cost comes from staples: rice (maybe 25 kg a month), wheat flour (around 10 kg), dals (various kinds, totalling maybe 5 kg), and cooking oil (3-4 liters).
