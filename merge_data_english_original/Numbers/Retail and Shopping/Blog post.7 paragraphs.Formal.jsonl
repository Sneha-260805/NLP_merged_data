The perception of paying less than Rs. 100, despite the negligible difference, can significantly influence purchasing decisions. Discount percentages like \"Flat 50% off\" during festive seasons like Diwali attract massive crowds, directly impacting sales figures. Retailers meticulously analyze historical sales data, identifying peak demand periods and tailoring promotional offers accordingly.

{"unnormalised": "Inventory management presents another arena where numbers reign supreme. Retailers meticulously track stock levels, minimizing storage costs and preventing stockouts. Concepts like \"just-in-time\" inventory rely heavily on precise demand forecasting, which is entirely data-driven. Software systems alert managers when stock falls below a predefined threshold, say, \"20 units\" of a particular product, triggering automated reordering processes. Analysis of sales patterns on specific days of the week, like \"Saturday sales are up by 15%\", allows retailers to optimize staffing and inventory levels for maximum efficiency.", "normalised": "Inventory management presents another arena where numbers reign supreme.

{"unnormalised": "Customer analytics presents perhaps the most data-intensive aspect of retail. Loyalty programs, offering points like \"Earn 10 points for every Rs. 100 spent,\" gather vast amounts of data on customer purchasing habits.

Retailers leverage these insights to personalize marketing campaigns, offering targeted promotions based on individual customer behavior. For instance, \"Customers who bought product X are also likely to purchase product Y\" recommendations, fueled by data analysis, drive cross-selling and upselling opportunities.", "normalised": "Customer analytics presents perhaps the most data-intensive aspect of retail.
