I ended up buying around 20 kgs of rice, 5 kgs of atta, and a whole bunch of dals, spices, and other household items. The total bill came to around Rs. 6500, which is easily Rs. 1000 less than what I'd normally pay at the corner store for the same things.", "normalised": "I recently went to D-Mart to stock up on groceries for the month, and let me tell you, the price differences compared to my local kirana store are quite something!

{"unnormalised": "It's not just the bulk discounts either. Even individual items are priced competitively. For example, I noticed a 1 litre bottle of sunflower oil was going for Rs. 140, while it's usually around Rs. 160-170 elsewhere. Same with things like sugar – a 5 kg bag was marked at Rs. 220. The deals are pretty tempting if you're willing to brave the crowds, especially on weekends. Last Sunday, it took me almost 45 mins just to check out!", "normalised": "It's not just the bulk discounts either. Even individual items are priced competitively.

I bought a new microwave oven for Rs. 5000 during Diwali sale, which originally was priced at Rs. 7000.
