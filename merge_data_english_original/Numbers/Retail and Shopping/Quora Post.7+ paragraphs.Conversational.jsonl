My cousin in Lucknow tells me he spends around Rs. 4000 per month for his family of four. Whereas, in Bangalore, for a similar family size, you might be looking at Rs. 6000-Rs. 8000.

Veggies generally cost less, but if you're a meat-eater, especially if you prefer chicken or mutton daily, budget can easily shoot up.
