Other times, it's a percentage, such as \"20% off\" the original price. Be careful though, as some offers may require a minimum purchase, like \"Rs. 200 off on purchases above Rs. 1000\". Also, watch out for \"Buy 1 Get 1\" offers; while they seem amazing, sometimes the individual price is inflated! A good way to make sure you're getting a good deal is to calculate the final price after the discount and compare it with other stores; you might find the same item for ₹800 somewhere else without any of the discount hassle. Don't just look at the big numbers like \"50% off;\" understanding the math ensures you're actually saving money.", "normalised": "It's good to be aware of the different ways retailers might present discounts!
