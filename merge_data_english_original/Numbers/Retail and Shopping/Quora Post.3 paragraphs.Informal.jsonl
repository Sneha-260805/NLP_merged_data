Like, you can find Surf Excel 1kg for ₹220 sometimes, which is a steal compared to the local kirana store that sells it for ₹250. And they have these crazy offers like \"Buy 2 Get 1 Free\" on stuff like shampoo and biscuits. My mom always stocks up on those!", "normalised": "Someone asked me what is the deal with prices at D-Mart? Well, to be honest, their pricing strategy is pretty aggressive.
