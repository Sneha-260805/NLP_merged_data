{"unnormalised": "Someone asked how much Indians typically spend on clothes annually. Well, it varies *a lot*, but I can give some rough figures. The average Indian household might spend anywhere from ₹5000 to ₹20,000 per year. This depends on income level, family size, and whether they prefer branded or unbranded clothes. Someone living in a metro like Mumbai will probably spend more than someone in a smaller town like Patna. Online shopping definitely influences these numbers now, too. Think about all the sales on sites like Myntra and Amazon – you can easily end up buying more than you planned!", "normalised": "Someone asked how much Indians typically spend on clothes annually.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the upper class. Their spending is in a completely different league. Designer clothes, international brands, and frequent shopping trips could easily lead to annual spends of ₹1 lakh or more.
