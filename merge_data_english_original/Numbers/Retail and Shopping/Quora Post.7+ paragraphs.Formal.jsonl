{"unnormalised": "Well, the shift is multifaceted. Firstly, e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon India are heavily reliant on algorithms to personalize shopping experiences. These platforms analyze browsing history, purchase patterns, and even time spent on product pages to generate product recommendations. Think about it, the \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\" section isn’t just random; it’s based on complex statistical analysis, often involving millions of data points. Ratings like \"4.5 out of 5 stars\" heavily influence customer trust.", "normalised": "Well, the shift is multifaceted.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, the rise of digital payment methods is directly linked to numerical convenience. UPI transactions, for example, are soaring. You see people scanning QR codes everywhere, from high-end malls to roadside tea stalls. The sheer volume of these transactions daily is staggering. Platforms like Paytm, PhonePe, and Google Pay process billions of rupees every single day, representing a massive shift away from cash. Think of your local Kirana store accepting payments via 91XXXXXXXX. That's the change in digital adoption of numbers.", "normalised": "Secondly, the rise of digital payment methods is directly linked to numerical convenience.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, consider the impact of discounts and promotional offers. Retailers are constantly experimenting with pricing strategies, often using complex mathematical models to determine the optimal discount percentage. A \"Buy One Get One Free\" offer, for instance, isn’t just a simple giveaway; it’s a calculated move based on inventory levels, profit margins, and competitor pricing. For example, \"Get 20% off on purchases above ₹2000\" is a frequent one nowadays. The perceived value drives consumers.", "normalised": "Thirdly, consider the impact of discounts and promotional offers.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, loyalty programs play a significant role. Points systems, cashback offers, and tiered membership levels are all designed to incentivize repeat purchases. These programs rely on tracking customer spending habits and rewarding them accordingly. A customer earning 10 points for every ₹100 spent is a common practice. Redemption rates and the overall effectiveness of these programs are closely monitored.", "normalised": "Fourthly, loyalty programs play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the analysis of sales data allows retailers to forecast demand and optimize inventory management. By tracking which products are selling well and when, retailers can ensure they have the right products in stock at the right time. The management tracks numbers such as; “Total Items sold this week: 2000”. This reduces the risk of stockouts and minimizes waste. This data-driven approach is particularly important in seasonal industries such as fashion, where demand can fluctuate dramatically throughout the year.", "normalised": "Moreover, the analysis of sales data allows retailers to forecast demand and optimize inventory management.

{"unnormalised": "The use of analytics to understand customer behavior is another key trend. Retailers are using data to gain insights into everything from customer demographics to preferred payment methods. This information is then used to tailor marketing campaigns and personalize the shopping experience.
