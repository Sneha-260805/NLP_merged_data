{"unnormalised": "In India, retail sales data collection occurs through a variety of methods. Organized retail chains often maintain meticulous records using POS (Point of Sale) systems. These systems capture transaction-level data, including SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) details, prices, quantities sold, payment methods, and timestamps. Major players like Reliance Retail and DMart utilize sophisticated analytics to understand consumer behavior based on this data. Unorganized retail, which constitutes a significant portion of the market, relies more on manual tracking, often making precise figures harder to obtain. Sample surveys and industry estimates play a crucial role in gauging overall trends, though the data from these sources often lacks the granularity of POS-driven numbers.", "normalised": "In India, retail sales data collection occurs through a variety of methods.

{"unnormalised": "Several organizations contribute to estimating retail sales figures. The Retailers Association of India (RAI) regularly publishes reports and surveys reflecting the performance of various retail segments. Government agencies like the National Statistical Office (NSO) also conduct periodic surveys that provide insights into consumer expenditure patterns. Market research firms such as Nielsen and Kantar offer syndicated reports based on their own data collection methodologies. These reports commonly break down sales by product category (e.g., FMCG, apparel, electronics), region (e.g., North, South), and channel (e.g., online, offline). Keep in mind that estimates can vary across different sources, and some may quote figures in INR crores or lakhs.", "normalised": "Several organisations contribute to estimating retail sales figures.

{"unnormalised": "Analysis of the data typically involves examining growth rates (e.g., YoY or QoQ growth), market share, sales per square foot, and conversion rates. Retailers leverage this information to optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns. For instance, observing a 15% increase in online sales of apparel in Q3 might prompt retailers to invest more in their e-commerce platforms and digital advertising. Furthermore, retailers analyse sales figures of products priced at Rs. 99 vs Rs. 100 to see the consumers' purchasing behavior. They also consider external factors like economic conditions, seasonal trends (e.g., Diwali sales), and demographic shifts to understand the underlying drivers of retail performance.", "normalised": "Analysis of the data typically involves examining growth rates (e.g., Year over Year or Quarter over Quarter growth), market share, sales per square foot, and conversion rates.
