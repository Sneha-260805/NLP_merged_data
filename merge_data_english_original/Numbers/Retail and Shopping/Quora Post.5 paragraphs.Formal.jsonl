{"unnormalised": "Retail and shopping in India are heavily reliant on numerical data, facilitating transactions, inventory management, and consumer analysis. Consider the price tags one encounters at D-Mart: a packet of Basmati rice might be marked at Rs. 650, while a bottle of refined sunflower oil could be priced at Rs. 120. These prices are not arbitrarily chosen but are determined by a complex interplay of factors including wholesale costs, transportation expenses, and profit margins, all meticulously tracked using numerical systems.", "normalised": "**Question (Implied): How are numbers used in retail and shopping in India?**"}
{"unnormalised": "Discounts and offers are another prevalent feature of Indian retail. Phrases like \"50% off\" or \"Buy 1 Get 1 Free\" are commonplace, immediately capturing the customer's attention. These promotions are strategically designed, using percentages and ratios to incentivize purchases. For instance, a saree originally priced at Rs. 2500 might be offered at a discounted price of Rs. 1750 during a Diwali sale, reflecting a 30% reduction. Such calculations are crucial for both the retailer in maximizing sales volume and the customer in making informed purchasing decisions.", "normalised": "Retail and shopping in India are heavily reliant on numerical data, facilitating transactions, inventory management, and consumer analysis. Consider the price tags one encounters at D-Mart: a packet of Basmati rice might be marked at rupees six hundred and fifty, while a bottle of refined sunflower oil could be priced at rupees one hundred and twenty. These prices are not arbitrarily chosen but are determined by a complex interplay of factors including wholesale costs, transportation expenses, and profit margins, all meticulously tracked using numerical systems."}
{"unnormalised": "Inventory management is another area where numbers play a vital role. Retailers like Reliance Retail must keep track of vast quantities of stock, from clothing and electronics to groceries and household items. This involves monitoring stock levels, sales rates, and reorder points. An item might be assigned a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) code, such as \"SKU-ABC-123,\" to ensure accurate tracking. Data on units sold per day, week, or month is essential for forecasting demand and optimizing inventory levels, ensuring that shelves are neither overstocked nor understocked.", "normalised": "Discounts and offers are another prevalent feature of Indian retail. Phrases like \"fifty percent off\" or \"Buy one Get one Free\" are commonplace, immediately capturing the customer's attention. These promotions are strategically designed, using percentages and ratios to incentivize purchases. For instance, a saree originally priced at rupees two thousand five hundred might be offered at a discounted price of rupees one thousand seven hundred and fifty during a Diwali sale, reflecting a thirty percent reduction. Such calculations are crucial for both the retailer in maximizing sales volume and the customer in making informed purchasing decisions."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the use of digital payment methods like UPI (Unified Payments Interface) and credit/debit cards has amplified the importance of numerical accuracy and security. A transaction of Rs. 399 made via PhonePe is instantly recorded and reconciled by the bank. Loyalty programs, such as those offered by Big Bazaar, rely on points systems (e.g., \"Earn 1 point for every Rs. 100 spent\") to reward frequent customers and encourage repeat business. These systems generate vast amounts of transactional data, which can be analyzed to understand consumer behavior, identify popular products, and personalize marketing campaigns.", "normalised": "Inventory management is another area where numbers play a vital role.

From pricing strategies and discount calculations to inventory management and digital transactions, numerical data serves as the foundation for efficient operations, informed decision-making, and enhanced customer experiences.
