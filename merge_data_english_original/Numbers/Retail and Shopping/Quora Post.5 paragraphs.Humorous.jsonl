{"unnormalised": "Seriously, though, I've got a theory. Maybe it's some ancient Indian philosophy about never being *quite* satisfied with a purchase? Like, you think you're getting a steal at Rs. 499, but deep down, you know they got you for that extra rupee. Or maybe shopkeepers just REALLY hate dealing with exact change. Imagine the chaos if everyone got back a single, solitary rupee! Auto-rickshaw drivers would be ecstatic, hoarding those tiny coins like Smaug with his gold!", "normalised": "Seriously, though, I have got a theory.
