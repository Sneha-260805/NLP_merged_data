I scored 75% overall, which honestly isn't terrible, but my marks in Maths are shockingly low, like barely passing with a 40/100.

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, I really prepped for Maths! Spent hours and hours doing sums, watching YouTube tutorials, even took extra coaching classes with Tuition Point near my house. Still ended up with a disaster of a score. Now I'm wondering if I should apply for revaluation. The last date for application is 25/07/2024. Anyone have any experience with revaluation in Mumbai University? Does it actually make a difference, or is it just a waste of Rs. 500 per subject?", "normalised": "The thing is, I really prepped for Maths!

{"unnormalised": "Also, kinda panicking about placements next year. Will this one bad grade ruin my chances of getting into a good company? Most companies have a minimum criteria of 60%, but they definitely look at individual subject scores too, right?
