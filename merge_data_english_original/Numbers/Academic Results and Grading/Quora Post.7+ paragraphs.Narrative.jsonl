I finished my Class 10th from Ryan International School, Delhi, in 2008. Back then, CGPA wasn't a thing; we were graded on percentage marks. I remember aiming for 90%+ throughout the year, driven by the pressure of joining the science stream in Class 11th.

I ended up doing my B.Tech from a decent engineering college, not an IIT, but still managed to get a good job. Ultimately, it's about continuous learning and growth, not just a number on a marksheet.
