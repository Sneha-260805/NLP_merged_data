{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's address the basics. Most educational boards and institutions in India employ a percentage-based system. A score of 90% or above is generally considered excellent, often denoted as an A+ or an Outstanding grade in many schools. Scores between 80% and 89% are usually regarded as very good (A grade), while a score ranging from 70% to 79% often earns a B+ grade, signifying good performance.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's address the basics.

{"unnormalised": "However, the devil is often in the details. Some institutions might use a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) system. This system assigns grade points to each subject, which are then averaged to calculate the overall CGPA. For instance, a CGPA of 9.0 out of 10 is typically considered equivalent to a score of 85% to 90%. Understanding the conversion rate specific to the institution is, therefore, paramount. For example, many IITs have their own CGPA to percentage conversion formulas.", "normalised": "However, the devil is often in the details.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the relative grading system is gaining traction in various universities. In this system, the grades are assigned based on the overall performance of the entire batch. If a student scores in the top 10% of the class, they might receive an A grade, irrespective of their absolute score. Therefore, a score of 75% in a highly competitive batch might still earn a high grade, while the same score in a less competitive batch might fetch a lower grade.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the relative grading system is gaining traction in various universities.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, the scorecard typically contains subject-wise marks, total marks, and the overall percentage or CGPA. It is essential to scrutinize the subject-wise marks to identify areas of strength and weakness. A student who consistently scores above 85% in mathematics but struggles to cross 60% in English needs to focus on improving their English proficiency.", "normalised": "Moreover, the scorecard typically contains subject-wise marks, total marks, and the overall percentage or C-G-P-A.

{"unnormalised": "The pass marks also vary depending on the educational board or institution. Generally, a minimum of 33% is required to pass a subject in school-level examinations. However, in many universities, the pass percentage is set at 40%. It is important to verify the specific pass criteria applicable to the examination in question. For example, in some professional courses, passing may require scoring at least 50% in both the theory and practical components separately.", "normalised": "The pass marks also vary depending on the educational board or institution.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the numerical scores, the scorecard may also contain qualitative remarks or comments from the teachers. These comments offer valuable insights into the student's learning abilities, attitude, and areas for improvement. For instance, a teacher might comment that \"Rohan demonstrates strong analytical skills but needs to improve his presentation skills,\" providing guidance for future development.", "normalised": "Beyond the numerical scores, the scorecard may also contain qualitative remarks or comments from the teachers.

{"unnormalised": "It is also crucial to be aware of the different grading systems employed by various educational boards. The CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) and the ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) follow distinct grading patterns. Understanding these differences is essential when comparing the academic performance of students from different boards. For instance, a 92% in ICSE might be considered equivalent to a 95% in CBSE, due to variations in the difficulty level of the examinations.", "normalised": "It is also crucial to be aware of the different grading systems employed by various educational boards.

Encouraging students to explore their interests and pursue extracurricular activities can foster holistic development, which is crucial for success in the long run.

It involves not only deciphering the numbers and letters on the scorecard but also considering the grading system, the relative performance of the batch, the qualitative remarks from teachers, and the overall development of the student. By adopting a holistic perspective, parents and students can effectively utilize academic results as a tool for growth and improvement. Furthermore, always remember to check official websites like cbse.nic.in or cisce.org for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding grading schemes and examination rules.", "normalised": "In conclusion, understanding academic results requires a nuanced approach.
