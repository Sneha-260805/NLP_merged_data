{"unnormalised": "Firstly, scrutinize the individual subject marks. A score of 90% in Mathematics might seem excellent, but if the class average is 95%, it indicates a relatively average performance within that specific cohort. Conversely, a score of 75% in Science, where the class average is 65%, suggests a comparatively strong grasp of the subject matter. This relative positioning provides a more nuanced perspective than merely observing the absolute value of the marks.", "normalised": "Firstly, scrutinize the individual subject marks.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, pay close attention to the internal assessment component, usually comprising 20% of the total score. Schools evaluate students on diverse criteria, such as regularity, assignments, presentations, and overall participation. High internal assessment scores may indicate strong work ethics and consistent engagement, while lower scores could point towards areas needing improvement in discipline or classroom involvement.", "normalised": "Secondly, pay close attention to the internal assessment component, usually comprising twenty percent of the total score.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, resist the urge to solely fixate on numerical marks and instead focus on overall growth and learning. A student might score 70 in a subject this term but display substantial progress from the previous one. Emphasize the importance of continuous learning, skill development, and a strong conceptual foundation rather than just rote memorization. Encourage your daughter to identify areas of weakness, seek help from teachers or tutors, and adopt effective study strategies to enhance her understanding and academic performance.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, interpreting a grade report requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. Analyze individual subject marks relative to class averages, scrutinize internal assessment components, consider grade descriptors, factor in examination difficulty, and prioritize overall growth over mere numerical scores. Most importantly, maintain open communication with your daughter's teachers to glean a holistic understanding of her academic progress and provide the necessary support and guidance to foster her intellectual development. Remember, the goal is to instill a love of learning and to empower your daughter to reach her full potential, not just to chase after high marks. Also remember, 9/10 students benefit from extra tuition at some stage.", "normalised": "In conclusion, interpreting a grade report requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach.
