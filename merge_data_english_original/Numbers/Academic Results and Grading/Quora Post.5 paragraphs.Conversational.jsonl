It is a bit different from what you might be used to in other countries, especially the U-S. Generally, most universities in India follow a percentage or a G-P-A (Grade Point Average) system. Let us break it down."}
{"unnormalised": "Typically, a score of 90% and above is considered outstanding, often represented as an 'A+' or 'O' (for Outstanding). Scores between 80%-89% would usually be an 'A', showing excellent performance. A 'B' grade is usually between 70%-79%, indicating good performance. Anything below 50% is generally considered a fail in most undergraduate courses. Some colleges, especially the really competitive ones like IIT Delhi or BITS Pilani, might have even higher cutoffs for each grade.", "normalised": "Typically, a score of ninety percent and above is considered outstanding, often represented as an 'A plus' or 'O' (for Outstanding). Scores between eighty percent and eighty nine percent would usually be an 'A', showing excellent performance. A 'B' grade is usually between seventy percent and seventy nine percent, indicating good performance. Anything below fifty percent is generally considered a fail in most undergraduate courses. Some colleges, especially the really competitive ones like I-I-T Delhi or B-I-T-S Pilani, might have even higher cutoffs for each grade."}
{"unnormalised": "The GPA system assigns numerical values to these letter grades. For example, an 'A+' might be a 10, an 'A' a 9, and so on. The GPA is then calculated as a weighted average of your grades across all subjects. Many institutions in India calculate the GPA out of a scale of 10. Keep in mind that each university has its own grading policy, so always check their official guidelines.", "normalised": "The G-P-A system assigns numerical values to these letter grades.
