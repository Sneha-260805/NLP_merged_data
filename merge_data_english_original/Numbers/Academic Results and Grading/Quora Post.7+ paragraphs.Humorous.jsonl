They're probably aliens, I swear.

{"unnormalised": "Also, let's be real, the grading system in some of these engineering colleges is…generous? I've heard stories of professors who seem to grade based on the alignment of the planets. So, a 75% in a tough college might actually be equivalent to a near-distinction in a less…rigorous institution. It's like comparing apples and oranges, or maybe samosas and kachoris. Both are delicious, but they are not the same thing.", "normalised": "Also, let's be real, the grading system in some of these engineering colleges is…generous?
