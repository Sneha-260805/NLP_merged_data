{"unnormalised": "First off, you'll encounter various grading systems. The most common one is the percentage system, where your marks are directly expressed as a percentage, e.g., 85%, 60%, 92%. Scoring 90%+ often puts you in the \"distinction\" category. Scoring above 60 % is considered first class.", "normalised": "First off, you will encounter various grading systems.

{"unnormalised": "But the Central Board of Secondary Education, or CBSE, which a lot of schools follow, also uses a grading system with letter grades. These range from A1 (highest) to E (failing). An A1 usually corresponds to the top 1/8th of students, scoring somewhere around 91% to 100% or so, depending on the subject and difficulty. An A2 might be 81%-90%. B1 71-80%.", "normalised": "But the Central Board of Secondary Education, or C-B-S-E, which a lot of schools follow, also uses a grading system with letter grades.

{"unnormalised": "State boards also exist, and they often have their own unique grading schemes. For example, some state boards might use a system with just numbers (1-7 or 1-9), where 1 is the highest and 7 or 9 is failing. Your GPA could differ greatly from state to state, and within institutions themselves. If you are planning to pursue higher education from a place other than where you completed your secondary school, this is something that you should take into consideration.", "normalised": "State boards also exist, and they often have their own unique grading schemes.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the grades themselves, relative performance matters a lot, especially in competitive exams like JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) or NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test). In JEE, a score of 200/300 might get you a good rank, depending on the difficulty level of that year's paper, especially if your competition is equally as prepared. Similarly, in NEET, a score of 650/720 is generally considered a very good score that will get you into a decent government medical college. These are highly dependent on difficulty, and will shift year to year.", "normalised": "Beyond the grades themselves, relative performance matters a lot, especially in competitive exams like J-E-E (Joint Entrance Examination) or N-E-E-T (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test).

{"unnormalised": "Also, grace marks are sometimes awarded, particularly in subjects where a large number of students have struggled. This could be, say, 5 marks given to everyone who scored below passing in a particularly difficult Math exam, thereby increasing the overall pass percentage. Keep in mind, academic culture in India can be fairly challenging and competitive. With millions of students competing for a limited number of seats in prestigious colleges and universities, the pressure to perform well is intense.", "normalised": "Also, grace marks are sometimes awarded, particularly in subjects where a large number of students have struggled.

{"unnormalised": "Colleges often set their cut-off percentages extremely high, sometimes reaching 95% or even 99% for popular courses.
