{"unnormalised": "Across various educational boards, including the CBSE and ICSE, the percentage system remains a cornerstone of grading. Students are typically assessed based on their marks obtained out of a total score, often expressed as a percentage. For instance, a student scoring 450 out of 500 would be recorded as 90%. However, the representation can vary. Some institutions might display it as \"90 %\", while others may use \"90%\" or even \"90 pc\". Further, the distinction between aggregate marks and individual subject scores is important. A student might have an overall 85% but varying subject scores like 78 in Maths, 92 in Science, and 85 in English. These individual percentages are often listed separately on mark sheets.", "normalised": "Across various educational boards, including the C-B-S-E and I-C-S-E, the percentage system remains a cornerstone of grading.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond percentages, Grade Point Average (GPA) systems are also widely adopted, particularly in higher education institutions. Many universities, including IITs and NITs, use a 10-point GPA scale. A student with a GPA of 8.5/10 would be considered to have performed exceptionally well. However, some institutions might use a different scale, such as a 4-point GPA, leading to potential confusion if not properly normalized. Moreover, the equivalent percentage of a GPA may be calculated differently across universities; one university might equate a GPA of 9.0 with 80%, while another could equate it to 85%.", "normalised": "Beyond percentages, Grade Point Average (G-P-A) systems are also widely adopted, particularly in higher education institutions. Many universities, including I-I-T-s and N-I-T-s, use a ten-point G-P-A scale. A student with a G-P-A of eight point five divided by ten would be considered to have performed exceptionally well. However, some institutions might use a different scale, such as a four-point G-P-A, leading to potential confusion if not properly normalized. Moreover, the equivalent percentage of a G-P-A may be calculated differently across universities; one university might equate a G-P-A of nine point zero with eighty percent, while another could equate it to eighty five percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, categorical grading systems, such as awarding grades like A, B, C, or D, are also in use. These grades may be further subdivided into A+, A, A-, B+, etc. The corresponding percentage range for each grade can differ significantly between institutions and boards. For example, an \"A\" grade could represent 80-90% in one system and 75-85% in another. The CBSE typically awards grades like A1, A2, B1, B2, etc., which are linked to specific percentage brackets. A student securing in the range of 91-100% gets grade A1.", "normalised": "Furthermore, categorical grading systems, such as awarding grades like A, B, C, or D, are also in use.

For example, an \"A\" grade could represent eighty to ninety percent in one system and seventy five to eighty five percent in another. The C-B-S-E typically awards grades like A one, A two, B one, B two, etcetera, which are linked to specific percentage brackets. A student securing in the range of ninety one to one hundred percent gets grade A one."}
{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, the academic grading systems in India are diverse and often presented in unnormalized formats. From percentage scores to GPA scales and categorical grades, the variations are numerous. Standardizing these diverse data points is essential for accurate data analysis, comparison of student performance across different institutions, and effective decision-making in the educational sector. Therefore, normalization models play a vital role in accurately interpreting and utilizing academic data.", "normalised": "In conclusion, the academic grading systems in India are diverse and often presented in unnormalized formats.
