Remember those old report cards with just a few marks out of 100? While those still exist in some places, many schools are experimenting with different grading systems. It’s not just about getting that 90% anymore; it’s about demonstrating a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Parents, though, still often fixate on the raw numbers, comparing their child’s 75/100 in maths with their neighbour's kid's 80.", "normalised": "Academic performance in India is undergoing a massive transformation, and how we track student progress is evolving too.

{"unnormalised": "This obsession with marks creates a lot of unnecessary pressure. For instance, the cutoffs for Delhi University colleges are sky-high, sometimes reaching 99% or even 100% for certain courses. Imagine the stress of having to score almost perfectly to get into your dream college! CBSE has also been trying to move away from rote learning and towards more competency-based assessments. You see, it is no more about getting 98/100 in Physics but also about practical application of physics.", "normalised": "This obsession with marks creates a lot of unnecessary pressure.

So, a student might get an A, which translates to a GPA of 3.7, even if their marks are in the range of 85-89%. This creates some confusion for parents who are used to the traditional marking system. Some schools also use a grading system with A+, A, B+, B, C, D, E to assess performance.", "normalised": "Many private schools have adopted a G-P-A system.
