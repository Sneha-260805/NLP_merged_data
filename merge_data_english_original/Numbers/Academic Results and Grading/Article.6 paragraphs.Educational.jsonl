While traditionally, percentages were the primary measure of a student's performance, the introduction of grading systems like the CBSE's CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) aimed to provide a more holistic assessment. Many students still chase the dream of scoring 90+% in their class 12th boards.

For example, a student scoring 75% in a challenging subject like Mathematics might demonstrate greater aptitude than another scoring 85% in a relatively easier subject.", "normalised": "However, understanding academic results goes beyond mere numbers.

Internal assessments often carry a weightage of 20-30%, emphasizing consistent performance throughout the semester.

A 'B' grade in one university might be equivalent to a 'C' in another. Even within the same institution, the grading distribution might differ across departments. So, 60% in engineering might be good but not the same for humanities. Some courses also have very strict marking schemes that further affects results.", "normalised": "Moreover, the interpretation of marks and grades varies significantly across different boards and institutions.

Socio-economic background, access to resources, and individual learning styles all play a role. Comparing results without accounting for these factors can be misleading. A student from a rural background with limited access to quality education might demonstrate remarkable resilience and potential despite scoring lower marks than their urban counterparts. 80% is the new 60% given the overall grade inflation.", "normalised": "Furthermore, it's important to consider the impact of external factors on academic performance.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, academic results and grading systems in India are complex and multifaceted. While numbers and grades provide a snapshot of a student's performance, it's crucial to interpret them within the broader context of their individual circumstances, the curriculum, and the assessment methods employed. To focus solely on the raw numerical value is a disservice to a student's academic journey and their overall potential. We need to look at qualitative metrics as well as quantitative metrics to holistically assess a student.", "normalised": "In conclusion, academic results and grading systems in India are complex and multifaceted.
