{"unnormalised": "First off, marks in 10th and 12th (CBSE/ICSE/State boards, doesn't really matter which) are often seen as a make-or-break situation. Scoring above 90% opens doors to, like, all the \"good\" colleges. If you get, say, 60% in 10th, people will generally look down on you and you'll start hearing things like \"isko toh kuch nahi aayega life mein\" (this one won't amount to anything in life). Harsh, but true. Pressure cooker situation, especially for kids from middle-class families where education is seen as the golden ticket.", "normalised": "First off, marks in tenth and twelfth (C-B-S-E slash I-C-S-E slash State boards, doesn't really matter which) are often seen as a make-or-break situation.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the college entrance exams. JEE for engineering (aim for a rank under 10,000 to get into a decent IIT), NEET for medicine (600+ marks is the safe zone), and CLAT for law. These exams are a HUGE deal. People spend years preparing for them. Coaching centres like FIITJEE and Aakash are practically industries unto themselves. The cutoffs are crazy high, and just clearing the exam is often not enough. You need a good rank to get into a \"good\" college.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the whole grading system in college itself. Most Indian universities use a CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) system, usually out of 10. Anything above 8 CGPA is considered good, 9+ is excellent. Some companies have a minimum CGPA requirement for internships and jobs (e.g., 7.5 CGPA or above). My friend at BITS Pilani was stressing because she got a 7.8 CGPA in her 2nd sem, saying she won't get any good internships.
