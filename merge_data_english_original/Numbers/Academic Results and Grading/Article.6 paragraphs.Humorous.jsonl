{"unnormalised": "Forget the nuance of \"well-rounded development\" or \"intrinsic motivation.\" In many households, it's all about the marks. 90%? Good. 95%? Excellent! 99.99%? Why not 100% beta? Sharmaji’s son got 98%, so clearly, you haven't been drinking enough Bournvita. The pressure is real, folks. And sometimes, hilariously absurd. Remember little Rohan who scored 65% in Maths? His parents grounded him from watching IPL for a whole month!

It's like the ongoing debate between chai and coffee, or Dhoni vs. Kohli. \"CBSE is easier,\" some claim, \"ICSE gives you a better foundation.\" Meanwhile, students are just trying to figure out how to score a decent CGPA (out of 10 of course) without losing their sanity.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not even get started on the grade inflation. Back in my day (said every uncle ever), scoring 70% was considered a sign of genius. Now, if you don't have a 9 as the first digit, you might as well start preparing for a career in, I don't know, professional cricket (unless you’re already brilliant at it, obviously). A perfect example is young Priya, she scored a whopping 88% but aunty still complains about her \"lost\" marks. ", "normalised": "And let's not even get started on the grade inflation.

Or at least, that’s what I tell myself after scoring a modest 60% on my last online quiz about quantum physics.", "normalised": "So, whether you’re celebrating a stellar performance or commiserating over a less-than-ideal score, remember to take a deep breath, enjoy a plate of jalebi, and tell yourself that you’re more than just a percentage.
