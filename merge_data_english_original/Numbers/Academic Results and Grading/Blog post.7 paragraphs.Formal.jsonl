{"unnormalised": "One prevalent metric is the percentage score. This expresses a student’s performance as a proportion of the total possible marks. For example, a student scoring 450 marks out of 500 would have a percentage score of 90%. This figure is frequently used for admissions to higher education institutions and for scholarship applications. Scoring 90%+ in CBSE is often considered a benchmark of academic excellence.", "normalised": "One prevalent metric is the percentage score. This expresses a student’s performance as a proportion of the total possible marks. For example, a student scoring four hundred and fifty marks out of five hundred would have a percentage score of ninety percent.

Scoring ninety percent plus in C-B-S-E is often considered a benchmark of academic excellence."}
{"unnormalised": "Another system employed is the Grade Point Average (GPA). The GPA assigns numerical values to letter grades (e.g., A=4.0, B=3.0). The overall GPA is calculated by averaging the grade points earned across all subjects. Some schools in India are adopting GPA systems, particularly those following international curricula, although the specific grading scales may vary. A GPA of 3.8/4.0 or above is generally considered very good.", "normalised": "Another system employed is the Grade Point Average (G-P-A). The G-P-A assigns numerical values to letter grades (e.g., A equals four point zero, B equals three point zero). The overall G-P-A is calculated by averaging the grade points earned across all subjects. Some schools in India are adopting G-P-A systems, particularly those following international curricula, although the specific grading scales may vary. A G-P-A of three point eight divided by four point zero or above is generally considered very good."}
{"unnormalised": "Many boards, like CBSE and ICSE, also use a grading system alongside percentage scores. These grades, typically ranging from A1 to E2, provide a qualitative assessment of a student’s performance relative to their peers. A1, for instance, represents the top 1/8th of students in a subject. Understanding the comparative performance is crucial for contextualizing the grade.", "normalised": "Many boards, like C-B-S-E and I-C-S-E, also use a grading system alongside percentage scores. These grades, typically ranging from A one to E two, provide a qualitative assessment of a student’s performance relative to their peers. A one, for instance, represents the top one eighth of students in a subject. Understanding the comparative performance is crucial for contextualizing the grade."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the concept of percentile scores is often used in competitive entrance exams like JEE Main and NEET. A percentile score indicates the percentage of students who scored below a particular candidate. If a student scores in the 99th percentile, it means they performed better than 99% of the test-takers. This is a vital metric for understanding a candidate's position among a large pool of applicants.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the concept of percentile scores is often used in competitive entrance exams like J-E-E Main and N-E-E-T.

This is a vital metric for understanding a candidate's position among a large pool of applicants."}
{"unnormalised": "In addition to numerical scores and grades, some institutions also incorporate qualitative assessments such as teacher feedback and class participation into the overall evaluation. These qualitative aspects provide a more holistic view of a student’s learning and development beyond purely academic performance. Teacher comments are often considered valuable insights into a student's strengths and areas for improvement.", "normalised": "In addition to numerical scores and grades, some institutions also incorporate qualitative assessments such as teacher feedback and class participation into the overall evaluation.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, navigating the landscape of academic results and grading in India necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the various metrics employed. By understanding the meaning and implications of percentage scores, GPAs, grades, percentile scores, and qualitative assessments, students and parents can gain a clearer picture of academic performance and make informed decisions about future educational pathways. For instance, a student scoring 75% in ISC might be evaluated differently than one scoring 75% in a state board examination.", "normalised": "In conclusion, navigating the landscape of academic results and grading in India necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the various metrics employed.
