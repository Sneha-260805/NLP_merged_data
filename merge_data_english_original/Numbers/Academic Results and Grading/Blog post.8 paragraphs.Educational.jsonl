{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's address the grading system. Many schools in India, following the CBSE or ICSE curriculum, use a numerical or alphabetical grading system. Numerical systems typically involve percentages, like 85% indicating a distinction. Alphabetical grades range from A+ to E, with A+ often representing 91-100 marks and E indicating a failing grade. Understanding the specific grading scale used by your child’s school is crucial. Don’t hesitate to ask the teachers for clarification if needed. Some schools also have internal grading systems.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's address the grading system. Many schools in India, following the C-B-S-E or I-C-S-E curriculum, use a numerical or alphabetical grading system.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the final grade, pay close attention to subject-specific marks. A score of 72 in Maths but 98 in English suggests a clear strength and an area needing attention. Don’t just focus on the numbers; read the teacher's comments carefully. These comments offer invaluable insights into your child’s learning process, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. If you see a comment mentioning need for more work on \"problem sums,\" you know exactly where to concentrate your efforts at home.", "normalised": "Beyond the final grade, pay close attention to subject-specific marks.

{"unnormalised": "Class averages provide context to your child's performance. If the class average in Science is 60 and your child scored 65, they are performing slightly above average. However, if the class average is 80, a score of 65 indicates a need for more focused study. Some schools also provide percentile ranks, indicating the percentage of students your child outperformed. A percentile rank of 80 means your child scored higher than 80% of their classmates.", "normalised": "Class averages provide context to your child's performance.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding different grading metrics is also essential. Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), commonly followed in many Indian schools, involves formative assessments (FA1, FA2, etc.) throughout the year, contributing to the final grade along with summative assessments (SA1, SA2 - typically mid-term and final exams). The weightage given to these assessments varies, but generally, a 40% weightage is assigned to Formative Assessments. A final score could look something like this: FA1 (10/10) + FA2 (9/10) + SA1 (75/80) + FA3 (8/10) + FA4 (9/10) + SA2 (70/80) = Overall Grade.", "normalised": "Understanding different grading metrics is also essential.

The weightage given to these assessments varies, but generally, a forty percent weightage is assigned to Formative Assessments.

Remember to celebrate successes, address challenges constructively, and foster a love of learning that extends beyond the classroom.
