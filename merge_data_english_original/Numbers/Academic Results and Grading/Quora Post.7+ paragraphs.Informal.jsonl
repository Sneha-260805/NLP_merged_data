{"unnormalised": "Well, honestly, it's complicated. Your 10th grade % and 12th grade % are HUGE in the Indian context, especially for the initial part of your career. Think of it this way: they're the first filters. Want to get into a decent college for undergrad? Your class 12 score is gonna be under the scanner. For engineering, a good score in PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) is super important, ideally 90%+. For arts and commerce, similar high percentages are expected in top colleges like Hindu College in Delhi or St. Xavier’s in Mumbai.", "normalised": "Well, honestly, it's complicated.

{"unnormalised": "See, for many undergraduate courses, especially at top institutions, cut-offs are often based on the percentage.
