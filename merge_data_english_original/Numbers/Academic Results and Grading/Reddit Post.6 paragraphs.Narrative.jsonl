I swear, I could practically hear my relatives collectively sighing from across the country. My maths score was a brutal 78/100, physics dragged me down with a 81 and Chemistry a decent 85 but English did save me with a 90 and Computers too helped with a 86.

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, I always felt like the grading system in India is kinda messed up. It's like, one tiny mistake in the exam, and BAM! Minus 2 marks.
