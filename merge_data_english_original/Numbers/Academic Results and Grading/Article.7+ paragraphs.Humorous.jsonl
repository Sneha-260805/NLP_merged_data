It's the same script every year, directed by the ever-demanding CBSE, ICSE, and State Boards. This year's star performances included young Rohan S., who apparently sacrificed sleep, social life, and possibly his sanity to score 98.7% in his Class 10 exams. He’s now being hailed as the next APJ Abdul Kalam. Meanwhile, little Meena got a, shall we say, *cozy* 62%, resulting in a family lockdown and a lifetime ban from using her phone.

Well, either everyone suddenly turned into Einstein overnight or the marking scheme is as lenient as my grandma when she's giving out sweets. My bet's on the latter, especially considering my cousin, who consistently scored in the single digits in math, somehow managed to snag a respectable 60% this time around.
