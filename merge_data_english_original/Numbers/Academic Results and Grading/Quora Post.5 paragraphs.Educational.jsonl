{"unnormalised": "Well, let's break down how academic results and grading typically work in the Indian education system. It can seem a bit complex at first, but hopefully, this explanation will clear things up for you. Especially when converting percentages to GPA or CGPA, there is often confusion. 7.5 CGPA is a common benchmark in many universities.", "normalised": "Well, let's break down how academic results and grading typically work in the Indian education system.

{"unnormalised": "First, understand that grading systems can vary significantly between institutions. What might be considered a good score at one university could be average at another. Some universities still rely heavily on percentage-based grading, where your marks are simply calculated as a percentage of the total marks. For example, scoring 85% in a subject is considered very good in many colleges. Many private universities grade out of 4.0 or 4.3, while others use a 10-point scale.", "normalised": "First, understand that grading systems can vary significantly between institutions.

{"unnormalised": "However, many institutions, particularly at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, now use a system based on the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). CGPA is a numerical representation of your overall academic performance. Each grade you receive in a course is assigned a grade point (e.g., A=10, B=8, C=6). This is very important because it's often needed to apply for jobs after your BE. The CGPA is then calculated by averaging these grade points, weighted by the number of credits assigned to each course. A 9.0 CGPA or above is generally considered excellent.", "normalised": "However, many institutions, particularly at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, now use a system based on the Cumulative Grade Point Average (C-G-P-A).

This is very important because it's often needed to apply for jobs after your B-E.

{"unnormalised": "Converting percentages to CGPA is where it gets a bit tricky. There isn't a universal formula, as each institution has its own conversion method. Some might use a linear scale (e.g., CGPA = Percentage/10), while others use a more complex formula that takes into account the distribution of grades. Check the official grading guidelines of your specific institution for the accurate conversion formula. Getting above 60% usually means you'll pass. In a nutshell, you can think of 100 marks being equal to 10 points, and then adjust down from there as your percentages decrease.", "normalised": "Converting percentages to C-G-P-A is where it gets a bit tricky.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the best way to understand the Indian grading system and CGPA is to consult the academic regulations of your specific university or college. They will provide detailed information on the grading scale, CGPA calculation method, and any other relevant policies. Don't hesitate to reach out to your professors or academic advisors for clarification if you're still unsure about something. Remember that consistently doing your best to understand all concepts will boost your grade much more than focusing solely on points.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the best way to understand the Indian grading system and C-G-P-A is to consult the academic regulations of your specific university or college.
