{"unnormalised": "The scoring systems vary across different boards. For example, CBSE typically awards marks out of 100, with a passing grade usually set at 33%. State boards, however, might have different passing percentages or even utilize grading systems like A+, A, B, etc. In higher education, CGPA scales are common, with many Indian universities following a 10-point or a 4-point scale. A CGPA of 8.5/10 is generally considered a strong academic performance.", "normalised": "The scoring systems vary across different boards. For example, C-B-S-E typically awards marks out of one hundred, with a passing grade usually set at thirty three percent. State boards, however, might have different passing percentages or even utilize grading systems like A plus, A, B, etcetera. In higher education, C-G-P-A scales are common, with many Indian universities following a ten-point or a four-point scale. A C-G-P-A of eight point five divided by ten is generally considered a strong academic performance."}
{"unnormalised": "Competitive exams like JEE Main, NEET, and CLAT also heavily rely on numerical scores. JEE Main uses a normalized score out of 300. Cracking NEET requires a score significantly above the qualifying cutoff, often 600+ out of a possible 720 for admission into top medical colleges like AIIMS. Understanding these cutoffs and the weightage given to different subjects is vital for focused preparation. For instance, Physics might carry a weightage of 25% in some engineering entrance exams.", "normalised": "Competitive exams like J-E-E Main, N-E-E-T, and C-L-A-T also heavily rely on numerical scores. J-E-E Main uses a normalized score out of three hundred. Cracking N-E-E-T requires a score significantly above the qualifying cutoff, often six hundred plus out of a possible seven hundred and twenty for admission into top medical colleges like A-I-I-M-S. Understanding these cutoffs and the weightage given to different subjects is vital for focused preparation. For instance, Physics might carry a weightage of twenty five percent in some engineering entrance exams."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond board exams and entrance tests, internal assessments and practical exams also contribute to a student's overall grade. Many schools follow a 80/20 or 70/30 split between written exams and internal assessments, giving due importance to project work and class participation. This means a student needs to consistently perform well throughout the academic year, not just during the final exams. Scoring 18/20 in internals can greatly boost the final percentage.", "normalised": "Beyond board exams and entrance tests, internal assessments and practical exams also contribute to a student's overall grade. Many schools follow an eighty divided by twenty or seventy divided by thirty split between written exams and internal assessments, giving due importance to project work and class participation.

Scoring eighteen divided by twenty in internals can greatly boost the final percentage."}
{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, while numbers provide a quantifiable measure of academic performance, they should not be the sole determinant of a student's potential. Focusing on holistic development, cultivating a love for learning, and building critical thinking skills are equally important for a successful future. Remember, a mark of 90% is excellent, but understanding the underlying concepts is what truly matters.", "normalised": "Ultimately, while numbers provide a quantifiable measure of academic performance, they should not be the sole determinant of a student's potential.
