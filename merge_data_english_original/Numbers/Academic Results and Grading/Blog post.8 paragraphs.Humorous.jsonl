{"unnormalised": "Let's rewind to my 10th standard results. The internet was slow, the anxiety was high, and the website kept crashing. After 27 attempts (yes, I counted), I finally saw my marks: 65% overall. My reaction? A mix of relief and slight disappointment. My mom, bless her heart, said, \"Beta, first division toh aa gaya!\" (At least you got a first division!). My dad, ever the practical one, immediately started calculating my potential career options based on that percentage. Apparently, becoming an astronaut was off the table.", "normalised": "Let us rewind to my tenth standard results. The internet was slow, the anxiety was high, and the website kept crashing.

We had subjects like \"Engineering Thermodynamics\" (which, to this day, I can't explain) and \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (which sounds cool but mostly involved staring at code until 3 AM).
