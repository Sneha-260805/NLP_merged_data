Suddenly, you’re not just competing with your class; you’re vying for a spot in Delhi University, IIT, or some other prestigious institution. Your JEE score or NEET ranking becomes your identity.

{"unnormalised": "And let’s not forget the grading systems within universities. Some colleges follow the CGPA system (Cumulative Grade Point Average), where a 10-point scale determines your overall performance. Others stick to percentages. My cousin studying at Mumbai University often complains that getting a mere 70% in a subject feels like a failing grade compared to his friends in other colleges.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s talk about internal assessments vs. external exams. Some colleges give significant weightage to internal assessments (maybe 40%), which includes assignments, presentations, and attendance. Others rely almost entirely on the end-of-semester exams (worth 80% or even 90%). This disparity can be super stressful, especially if you’re someone who shines in project work but crumbles under exam pressure.", "normalised": "Now, let’s talk about internal assessments versus external exams.

To really stand out, you need to aim for a distinction (75% or higher). And if you’re dreaming of an MBA, your CAT score is king. People with a 99 percentile get interview calls from IIMs, while others with slightly lower scores have to settle for less.
