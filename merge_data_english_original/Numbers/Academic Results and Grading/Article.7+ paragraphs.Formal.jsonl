{"unnormalised": "The CBSE, one of the largest boards, reported an overall pass percentage of 93.12% for Class 12 exams in 2023. This figure represents a slight decrease from the 94.54% recorded in 2022. However, the number of students scoring above 90% remained significant, with approximately 1.34 lakh students achieving this milestone. In Class 10, the pass percentage stood at 94.40%, a marginal improvement compared to the previous year's 94.4%.", "normalised": "The C-B-S-E, one of the largest boards, reported an overall pass percentage of ninety three point one two percent for Class twelve exams in two thousand twenty three. This figure represents a slight decrease from the ninety four point five four percent recorded in two thousand twenty two. However, the number of students scoring above ninety percent remained significant, with approximately one point three four lakh students achieving this milestone. In Class ten, the pass percentage stood at ninety four point four zero percent, a marginal improvement compared to the previous year's ninety four point four percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Similar trends are observed in the ICSE board. The overall pass percentage for Class 10 ICSE exams in 2023 was 98.94%, while the ISC (Class 12) pass percentage was 96.93%. While these figures are impressively high, they also indicate a marginal decrease compared to the exceptionally high percentages during the pandemic years, where internal assessments played a larger role. Schools like Don Bosco, Mumbai, and La Martiniere, Kolkata, consistently demonstrated high performance with over 95% of their students passing with first-class grades.", "normalised": "Similar trends are observed in the I-C-S-E board. The overall pass percentage for Class ten I-C-S-E exams in two thousand twenty three was ninety eight point nine four percent, while the I-S-C (Class twelve) pass percentage was ninety six point nine three percent. While these figures are impressively high, they also indicate a marginal decrease compared to the exceptionally high percentages during the pandemic years, where internal assessments played a larger role. Schools like Don Bosco, Mumbai, and La Martiniere, Kolkata, consistently demonstrated high performance with over ninety five percent of their students passing with first-class grades."}
{"unnormalised": "State boards, such as the Maharashtra State Board and the Tamil Nadu State Board, also presented their results. Maharashtra reported a Class 12 pass percentage of 91.25%, and Tamil Nadu reported 92%. Analysis of subject-specific performance reveals varying trends. In mathematics, the average score was 72/100, while in English, it was 78/100. These differences are crucial for educators and policymakers to identify areas needing more focused attention.", "normalised": "State boards, such as the Maharashtra State Board and the Tamil Nadu State Board, also presented their results.

In mathematics, the average score was seventy two divided by one hundred, while in English, it was seventy eight divided by one hundred. These differences are crucial for educators and policymakers to identify areas needing more focused attention."}
{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to these observed trends. The transition back to offline exams after the pandemic has undoubtedly impacted student performance. The increased emphasis on conceptual understanding and application-based questions in the curriculum requires students to adapt their learning strategies. Furthermore, disparities in access to resources and quality education across different regions of India continue to influence academic outcomes. Students from metropolitan areas like Delhi and Bangalore often have better access to coaching centers and advanced learning resources compared to their counterparts in rural areas.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to these observed trends.

{"unnormalised": "The grading system also plays a significant role. CBSE follows a 9-point grading system for Class 10, where A1 is the highest grade, while ICSE uses a percentage-based system. Understanding the nuances of each grading system is essential for fair comparison and evaluation. The percentage of students securing A1 grades in CBSE Class 10 was roughly 8.34%, while those securing above 90% in ICSE Class 10 was 45.5%.", "normalised": "The grading system also plays a significant role. C-B-S-E follows a nine-point grading system for Class ten, where A one is the highest grade, while I-C-S-E uses a percentage-based system. Understanding the nuances of each grading system is essential for fair comparison and evaluation. The percentage of students securing A one grades in C-B-S-E Class ten was roughly eight point three four percent, while those securing above ninety percent in I-C-S-E Class ten was forty five point five percent."}
{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, the recent academic results indicate a nuanced landscape of student performance across India. While overall pass percentages remain high, there are subtle variations and challenges that need to be addressed. Continuous monitoring of these trends, coupled with targeted interventions and policy reforms, is essential to ensure equitable and high-quality education for all students. Further research into the socio-economic factors influencing student performance is warranted to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. The long-term goal is to improve not just pass percentages, but also the depth of understanding and critical thinking skills among students, preparing them for future challenges and opportunities.", "normalised": "In conclusion, the recent academic results indicate a nuanced landscape of student performance across India.
