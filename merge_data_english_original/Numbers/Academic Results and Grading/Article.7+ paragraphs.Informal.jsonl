Honestly, it's like waiting for the monsoon – you know it's coming, you're kinda prepared, but the actual downpour can still catch you off guard.

Our parents are even worse than we are, making us compare ourselves to our neighbour. What I realised is that these numbers don't define you. Yes, they're important for getting into certain colleges or fields, but they don't measure your potential, your creativity, or your passion.

{"unnormalised": "It’s important to look beyond the marksheet. I always remind my brother what I got in Maths (just a pass!) and he usually stops talking after that. Look at all the entrepreneurs and artists who weren't academic geniuses, but still changed the world.

Your marks are just one part of the story, not the whole book. And hey, if things don't go as planned, there's always chai and samosas to make you feel better! Plus, if you're not happy with a mark, you can always apply for re-evaluation if the mark is very low.
