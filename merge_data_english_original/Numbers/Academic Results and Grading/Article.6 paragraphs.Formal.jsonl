{"unnormalised": "The performance of Indian students in the recently concluded CBSE Class 10 exams has been a subject of considerable discussion. Initial reports indicate a pass percentage of 93.12%, a slight dip compared to the 94.40% recorded in the previous academic year. The distribution of marks reveals that a significant portion of students secured scores in the range of 60%-75%, while a smaller fraction achieved distinctions with marks above 85%. This data suggests a consistent yet varied level of academic achievement across the board.", "normalised": "The performance of Indian students in the recently concluded C-B-S-E Class ten exams has been a subject of considerable discussion. Initial reports indicate a pass percentage of ninety three point one two percent, a slight dip compared to the ninety four point four zero percent recorded in the previous academic year. The distribution of marks reveals that a significant portion of students secured scores in the range of sixty percent to seventy five percent, while a smaller fraction achieved distinctions with marks above eighty five percent.

{"unnormalised": "Analysis of regional performance highlights certain disparities. Students from the southern states, particularly Tamil Nadu and Kerala, continue to outperform their counterparts in the northern and eastern regions. The average score in Kerala was reported to be 82.5%, significantly higher than the national average. Conversely, states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh recorded lower average scores, prompting concerns about equitable access to quality education. Further investigation is warranted to understand the factors contributing to these regional differences.", "normalised": "Analysis of regional performance highlights certain disparities.

{"unnormalised": "Subject-wise performance data also provides valuable insights. Mathematics and Science continue to be subjects where students face challenges, with the average scores hovering around 65% and 68% respectively. On the other hand, languages such as English and Hindi witnessed higher average scores, reflecting a relatively stronger command over these subjects. These trends underscore the need for targeted interventions and pedagogical reforms to enhance students' proficiency in the STEM fields.", "normalised": "Subject-wise performance data also provides valuable insights.

{"unnormalised": "The emphasis on holistic development and continuous assessment has led to a gradual shift away from rote learning towards a more application-based approach. Despite this positive shift, the examination system continues to play a crucial role in evaluating students' academic progress. The pressure to score high marks, particularly in competitive exams like NEET and JEE, remains a significant source of stress for many students. Addressing this issue requires a concerted effort from educators, parents, and policymakers alike.", "normalised": "The emphasis on holistic development and continuous assessment has led to a gradual shift away from rote learning towards a more application-based approach.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, the academic results and grading patterns of Indian students reflect a complex interplay of factors, including regional disparities, subject-wise variations, and evolving pedagogical approaches. Addressing the challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all stakeholders. It is crucial that students receive a well-rounded education that equips them with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to thrive in an increasingly competitive and interconnected world. For example, several students in DPS, RK Puram scored above 90%, and some even got a perfect 100 in Maths.", "normalised": "In conclusion, the academic results and grading patterns of Indian students reflect a complex interplay of factors, including regional disparities, subject-wise variations, and evolving pedagogical approaches.
