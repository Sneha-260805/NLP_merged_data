A friend’s daughter, Aisha, scored 92% in her ISC exams, but still wasn't sure of getting into the college of her choice for B.Com. It’s just gotten so competitive! Remember the days when 70% was considered brilliant? Now, 90% seems to be the new normal. My dad used to say scoring over 60% meant you were set for life! Things have changed a lot since then.", "normalised": "Speaking of marks, cut-offs for colleges are soaring these days.

Someone told me that a CGPA of 8.5 is roughly equivalent to 80%, but honestly, I still get confused by all the conversions.

My nephew flunked Physics, but ended up becoming an awesome graphic designer. Life has its own way of sorting things out. There is also the matter of re-evaluation, which I’ve heard can potentially increase your marks. I remember having a friend that went from 70 to 74 in Maths after his paper was rechecked.", "normalised": "Also, don't stress too much if the results aren't exactly what you hoped for.
