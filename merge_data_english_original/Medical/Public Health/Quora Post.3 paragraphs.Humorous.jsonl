Public health, my friend, is like trying to herd cats – except the cats are microscopic and can give you the worst flu of your life. Think of vaccinations as tiny bodyguards for your immune system.

And before you ask, no, they don't cause autism. That's a bigger myth than Rahul Gandhi winning an election.", "normalised": "Seriously though, vaccinations are a big deal, especially for kids.
