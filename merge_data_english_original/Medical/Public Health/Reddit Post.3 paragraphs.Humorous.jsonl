My auntie Priya keeps forwarding me WhatsApp forwards about some miracle concoction of haldi, tulsi, and ginger that apparently makes you immune to everything from the common cold to, I don’t know, maybe even taxes? Last week she even tried to prepone my Diwali visit 'cause she said it's \"peak flu season\" and I needed to down 3 shots of her home brew. At this rate, I'm gonna be more immune to the taste of her \"magic potion\" than any actual virus.

Maybe we should all start a support group... or just invest in a lifetime supply of face masks and earplugs. Side note: anyone know where I can find a good N-95 mask that also blocks out well-meaning relatives? Asking for, uh, research purposes. Also, is 6 months enough to recover from 1 dose of Auntie Priya’s brew?", "normalised": "So, yeah, rant over.
