More people are wearing masks (at least sometimes!), and there's more talk about things like hygiene and sanitation. The govt. is pushing initiatives too. Like, they're really trying to get everyone vaccinated, and there are lots of campaigns running. But the infrastructure? Still a challenge.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about the current state of public health in India, especially after C-O-V-I-D-nineteen. It's a mixed bag, honestly.

You read news about people having to travel 50+ km just to see a Dr. And then there's the whole issue of affordability. Private hospitals like Apollo or Max can be super expensive. Plus, even basic medicines can be costly for many.

Addressing these requires long-term solutions and a multi-pronged approach involving the govt., NGOs, and the community.
