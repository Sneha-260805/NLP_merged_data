The air hung thick with humidity, and the usual cacophony of the city was punctuated by the rhythmic drumming of rain on corrugated iron roofs.

But when the time comes…,\" she'd grumbled, stirring her morning chai. Her words, as usual, proved prophetic. Within a week, the local clinic, \"Dr. Patil's Clinic\", was overflowing with patients complaining of fever, vomiting, and fatigue. The doctor, a harried-looking man in his late 50s, confirmed our worst fears: a surge in cases of dengue and gastroenteritis. He even mentioned, almost in passing, that a suspected case of leptospirosis had been reported at KEM Hospital.", "normalised": "My mother, a retired school teacher from Dadar, however, wasn't convinced. \"These promises, beta, they make them every year.

{"unnormalised": "Our chawl, like many others in Mumbai, wasn't exactly a model of hygiene. Stagnant water collected in every conceivable nook and cranny – discarded tires, broken flowerpots, even coconut shells left carelessly in the yard. The perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying vectors. The municipal workers, bless their hearts, did their best, fogging the area with insecticide every few days. But it felt like a temporary solution, a band-aid on a gaping wound. I often wondered if the fogging actually did any good at all. Maybe it’s only a placebo.", "normalised": "Our chawl, like many others in Mumbai, wasn't exactly a model of hygiene.

I organized a small group of volunteers from our chawl to clean up the area, removing stagnant water and educating our neighbors about preventive measures. We distributed pamphlets on mosquito control, emphasizing the importance of keeping our surroundings clean. It was a small effort, I know, but it was a start. Maybe, just maybe, we could make a difference, one clean drain at a time. I even emailed some local NGOs to check if they could help us with mosquito nets for each of the residents, or provide basic medicines such as paracetamol 650 mg.", "normalised": "I decided to take matters into my own hands.
