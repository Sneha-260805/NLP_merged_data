{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing issues is the uneven distribution of healthcare resources. Urban centers often boast advanced medical facilities and a concentration of specialists, while rural areas struggle with a lack of infrastructure, limited access to qualified doctors, and inadequate supplies. The doctor-patient ratio in rural India remains alarmingly low, with some regions reporting as few as 1 doctor per 10,000 people. This disparity disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing inequalities. Initiatives like the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have attempted to address this gap, but sustained efforts and increased investment are crucial. The impact of programs like PMJAY which aims to provide health insurance coverage of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year is still being evaluated.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing issues is the uneven distribution of healthcare resources.

{"unnormalised": "Infectious diseases remain a major public health concern. India bears a significant burden of diseases like tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and HIV/AIDS. Despite national programs aimed at controlling these diseases, factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and poor sanitation contribute to their continued prevalence. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB poses an additional challenge, requiring innovative treatment strategies and robust surveillance mechanisms. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed vulnerabilities in the public health infrastructure, highlighting the need for stronger disease surveillance and response systems. The impact of long COVID is also being studied.", "normalised": "Infectious diseases remain a major public health concern.

{"unnormalised": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasingly contributing to the burden of disease in India. Conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases are on the rise, driven by factors such as changing lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and environmental pollution. The prevalence of diabetes in India is particularly concerning, with an estimated 77 million adults living with the condition. Public health interventions aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles, early detection, and effective management of NCDs are essential to mitigate their impact. Initiatives like the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) are crucial, though their reach needs to be expanded.", "normalised": "Non-communicable diseases (N-C-Ds) are increasingly contributing to the burden of disease in India.

{"unnormalised": "Environmental health is another critical area of concern. Air and water pollution, inadequate waste management, and exposure to hazardous substances pose significant risks to public health. Many Indian cities suffer from alarmingly high levels of air pollution, contributing to respiratory illnesses and other health problems. Access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities remains a challenge for a significant portion of the population. Investing in environmental protection and promoting sustainable practices are essential to safeguard public health. The Ganga Action Plan and similar initiatives need continued support and expansion.", "normalised": "Environmental health is another critical area of concern.

{"unnormalised": "Opportunities for improvement abound. Leveraging technology to enhance access to healthcare, improve disease surveillance, and empower patients is crucial. Telemedicine and mobile health (mHealth) interventions can bridge the gap in access to care, particularly in remote areas. Strengthening the public health workforce through training and capacity building is also essential. Furthermore, fostering partnerships between the government, private sector, and civil society organizations can create a more robust and responsive public health system. Programs like eSanjeevani have shown great promise.", "normalised": "Opportunities for improvement abound.

{"unnormalised": "Increased investment in public health infrastructure is paramount. This includes building more hospitals and primary healthcare centers, upgrading existing facilities, and ensuring adequate supplies of medicines and equipment. Strengthening the public health supply chain and improving logistics management are also crucial to ensure that essential resources reach those who need them most. A budgetary allocation of 2.5% of GDP as recommended by the National Health Policy 2017 is still a goal yet to be achieved.", "normalised": "Increased investment in public health infrastructure is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, public health in India faces significant challenges, but also holds immense opportunities for improvement. By addressing the uneven distribution of resources, tackling infectious and non-communicable diseases, protecting the environment, and leveraging technology, India can build a healthier and more equitable future for all its citizens. A multi-pronged approach involving government, private sector, and individuals is essential to realize this vision. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 which focuses on health and well-being, provide a framework for guiding efforts and measuring progress.", "normalised": "In conclusion, public health in India faces significant challenges, but also holds immense opportunities for improvement.
