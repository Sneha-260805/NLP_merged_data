On one hand, the govt is pushing initiatives like Ayushman Bharat, aiming to provide health insurance to, like, 50 Cr people. That's a LOT. Plus, there are schemes for vaccination, sanitation drives, and awareness campaigns about diseases like TB and malaria.", "normalised": "Hey guys, someone asked about the state of public health in India, especially after the pandemic.

Shortage of doctors, nurses, and basic equipment is a major issue. AIIMS Delhi, despite being top-notch, is always overcrowded.
