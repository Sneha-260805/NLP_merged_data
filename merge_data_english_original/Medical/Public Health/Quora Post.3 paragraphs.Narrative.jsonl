I remember getting my Covaxin shot at the local PHC on 15/05/2021. The sheer scale was impressive. Plus, programs like the National Health Mission are crucial for addressing maternal and child health, particularly in rural areas. My cousin, Dr. Sharma, works in a rural clinic in Bihar and she’s constantly dealing with cases of malnutrition and infectious diseases. The challenges are real, esp. with limited resources & infrastructure.", "normalised": "Someone asked me how prepared India is for the next big health crisis. Honestly, it's a mixed bag.

And while we have institutions like AIIMS, the accessibility and affordability of quality healthcare remain a problem for many, especially the poor. Consider the cost of treatment for something like TB; it can be a huge financial burden. Also, dealing with misinformation, especially on social media, is a constant battle.
