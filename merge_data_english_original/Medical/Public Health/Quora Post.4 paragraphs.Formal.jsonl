{"unnormalised": "India faces several significant public health challenges. One major area of concern is communicable diseases. Diseases like TB, malaria, and dengue continue to be prevalent, particularly in densely populated areas and regions with poor sanitation. For instance, in 2023, there were over 2.5 million cases of TB reported, according to MoHFW data. Addressing these requires improved disease surveillance, timely diagnosis, and effective treatment strategies. The implementation of the National Health Mission is crucial for controlling these diseases.", "normalised": "India faces several significant public health challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another pressing issue is the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are on the rise due to factors such as changing lifestyles, dietary habits, and aging populations. According to a WHO report, NCDs account for approximately 60% of deaths in India. Early detection through regular health check-ups, promoting healthier lifestyles, and providing affordable treatment options are vital. Programs like the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) aim to address this.", "normalised": "Another pressing issue is the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (N-C-Ds).

{"unnormalised": "Maternal and child health also remains a challenge. While there has been progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, disparities persist across different states and socio-economic groups. Ensuring access to quality antenatal care, safe delivery practices, and post-natal care is essential. Schemes like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) aim to incentivize institutional deliveries and improve maternal health outcomes. Moreover, addressing malnutrition in children under 5 yrs old is critically important.", "normalised": "Maternal and child health also remains a challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, strengthening the public health infrastructure and workforce is paramount. This involves increasing the number of healthcare professionals, improving the quality of healthcare facilities, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas. The government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme, which aims to provide health insurance coverage to over 500 million people, is a significant step in this direction. Further investment in digital health infrastructure, like the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), can also enhance healthcare delivery and improve public health outcomes in the long run.", "normalised": "Finally, strengthening the public health infrastructure and workforce is paramount.
