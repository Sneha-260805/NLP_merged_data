On one hand, initiatives like the National Health Mission and Ayushman Bharat are trying to make healthcare more accessible, especially in rural areas. You see more govt. run health camps offering free checkups and vaccinations for diseases like Polio & TB. Plus, there's been a push for digital health records to improve efficiency.", "normalised": "Someone asked if India's public health system is improving. Well, it's a mixed bag, honestly.

You might find only 1 or 2 doctors serving a population of thousands! And while schemes like Ayushman Bharat aim to provide health insurance coverage of up to Rs. 5 lakh, navigating the paperwork and actually getting treated at a good hospital can be a real challenge.", "normalised": "However, the infrastructure is still a major issue.

Plus, outbreaks of diseases like dengue and malaria are still common, especially during the monsoon season. So, while there's progress, there's still a long way to go before India can truly boast of a robust and equitable public health system. Getting more specialists like cardiologists and oncologists into smaller towns is a must, IMO.", "normalised": "Funding is another big problem.
