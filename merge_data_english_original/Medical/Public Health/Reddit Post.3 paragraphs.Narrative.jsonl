Not just in fancy AIIMS hospitals in big cities, but in improving the infrastructure and facilities at these grassroots level PHCs. It’s about making sure that every Indian, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status, has access to basic healthcare. Seriously, a little investment now can save lives later.
