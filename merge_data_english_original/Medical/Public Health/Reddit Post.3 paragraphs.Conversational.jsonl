Seems like every other household in my locality (near Powai, Mumbai) has someone down with a fever. My neighbour’s kid, 7 y.o., was just diagnosed. They rushed him to Hiranandani Hospital yesterday. Scary stuff! M.C.G.M. needs to step up their fogging game, ASAP.", "normalised": "Hey guys, anyone else feeling extra anxious about the recent spike in Dengue cases?

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, what precautions are y'all taking? I’ve stocked up on mosquito repellent (Odomos, obviously!) and making sure everyone wears full sleeves, even in this crazy humidity. Read somewhere that the Aedes mosquito, which spreads Dengue, usually bites during the day, especially around 2 PM-4 PM. Also, clearing out stagnant water from flower pots and coolers. My mom's nagging about neem leaves being a natural repellent - gotta try that too. Rs. 20 well spent if it works, I guess.", "normalised": "Seriously though, what precautions are you all taking?
