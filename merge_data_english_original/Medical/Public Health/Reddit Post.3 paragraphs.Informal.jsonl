{"unnormalised": "Guys, seriously worried about this new viral going around. Doc said it's some kinda mutated flu strain, but all I'm seeing is ppl calling it \"Delhi Belly 2.0\". My younger brother, Vikas, caught it last week. Started with a fever of 102°F & then progressed to, well, let's just say he was glued to the toilet for 3 days straight! He's still feeling weak, even after a week of ORS & Khichdi. Anyone else in Delhi/NCR experiencing this? Is this a \"prepone\" to the monsoon illnesses, or is it something new?", "normalised": "Guys, seriously worried about this new viral going around.

Apparently, the hospital's swamped with similar cases, especially kids under 10 yrs old. They're saying it’s highly contagious, so gotta be super careful. They prescribed him some antacids & probiotics and advised quarantine for at least 5 days. I'm hearing rumours about some schools shutting down temporarily because of the outbreak.", "normalised": "He went to A-I-I-M-S for checkup, and they did like, a whole bunch of tests – blood work, stool sample, the works.

{"unnormalised": "So, fellow redditors, any tips on how to avoid catching this thing? Is it just basic hygiene – washing hands with Dettol after every chai break? Or should we be stocking up on immunity boosters like Chyawanprash? Also, anyone know if the govt. is planning any kind of public health campaign? Stay safe, folks!", "normalised": "So, fellow redditors, any tips on how to avoid catching this thing? Is it just basic hygiene – washing hands with Dettol after every chai break?
