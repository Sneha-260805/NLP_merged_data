{"unnormalised": "Hey, did you guys see the news about the new dengue outbreak in Kerala? Apparently, it's way worse than last year. The govt. is saying to use mosquito repellent and keep your surroundings clean. Dr. Nair from CMC Vellore suggests wearing full sleeves, especially for kids. They’re also doing fogging in some areas but it's not enough, IMO. Stay safe everyone and get your blood tests done ASAP if you have a fever over 100°F.", "normalised": "Hey, did you guys see the news about the new dengue outbreak in Kerala?
