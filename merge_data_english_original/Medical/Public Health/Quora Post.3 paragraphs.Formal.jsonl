{"unnormalised": "India faces numerous challenges in public health. One significant hurdle is the uneven distribution of healthcare resources. While metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi boast advanced medical facilities like AIIMS and Apollo Hospitals, rural areas often lack basic infrastructure and trained personnel. This disparity leads to delayed diagnoses and treatment, especially for conditions like TB and malaria, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Moreover, public health campaigns, like those promoting vaccination and sanitation, face logistical difficulties in reaching remote villages and educating diverse communities.", "normalised": "India faces numerous challenges in public health.

{"unnormalised": "Another critical issue is the prevalence of communicable diseases. Despite progress, diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and typhoid continue to pose a threat. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate access to clean water contribute to their spread. For instance, during the monsoon season, waterborne diseases see a surge, particularly in densely populated urban slums. Combating these diseases requires a multi-pronged approach, including improved sanitation infrastructure, effective disease surveillance, and public awareness campaigns emphasizing preventive measures. The National Health Mission, operational since 2005, tries to address this through various schemes, however, challenges remain.", "normalised": "Another critical issue is the prevalence of communicable diseases.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, India grapples with the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Lifestyle changes, including unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity, contribute to this trend. The cost of treating NCDs places a strain on both individuals and the healthcare system. Early detection, health education programs promoting healthy lifestyles, and affordable access to treatment are crucial to address this growing challenge. In 2023, cancer cases were estimated at 1.46 million according to the National Cancer Registry Programme.", "normalised": "Finally, India grapples with the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (N-C-Ds) such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.
