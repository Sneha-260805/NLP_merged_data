{"unnormalised": "A recent study published in the \"Indian Journal of Medical Genetics\" has revealed new insights into the prevalence of Beta Thalassemia in the Sindhi community. The research, conducted by Dr. Aisha Khan and her team at AIIMS Delhi, analyzed genetic markers from 500 individuals identifying a higher than previously estimated carrier rate of 1 in 15. The study further pinpointed specific genetic mutations commonly found in the region.", "normalised": "A recent study published in the \"Indian Journal of Medical Genetics\" has revealed new insights into the prevalence of Beta Thalassemia in the Sindhi community.

Currently, genetic counseling is not universally accessible, especially in rural areas. Increased awareness campaigns about pre-marital testing for genetic disorders are crucial to reduce the incidence of affected children.

Further research is planned to explore the genetic landscape of other communities in India and develop tailored screening strategies.
