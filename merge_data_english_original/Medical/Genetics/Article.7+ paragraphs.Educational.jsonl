{"unnormalised": "At the heart of genetics lies DNA, the molecule that carries our hereditary information. Encoded within DNA are genes, the instructions for building and maintaining our bodies. Genetic disorders arise when there are changes or mutations in these genes. These mutations can be inherited from parents (hereditary genetic disorders) or occur spontaneously during an individual's lifetime (de novo mutations). A single gene mutation can have cascading effects, disrupting protein synthesis, cellular function, and ultimately, leading to disease. For instance, mutations in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis, affecting the lungs and digestive system. Another example is down syndrome, which results from trisomy 21 or having an extra copy of chromosome 21.", "normalised": "At the heart of genetics lies D-N-A, the molecule that carries our hereditary information.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic disorders are broadly categorized based on the type of genetic alteration involved. Single-gene disorders, as the name suggests, are caused by mutations in a single gene. Examples include sickle cell anemia, caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, and Huntington's disease, caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Chromosomal disorders, on the other hand, involve alterations in the structure or number of chromosomes. Down syndrome, mentioned earlier, is one example. Turner syndrome (45,X0), where females have a missing or incomplete X chromosome, is another. Multifactorial disorders arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. These conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, are often more complex to understand and manage because of the interplay of multiple genes and environmental exposures.", "normalised": "Genetic disorders are broadly categorized based on the type of genetic alteration involved.

{"unnormalised": "Diagnosis of genetic disorders has been revolutionized by advances in genetic testing. Techniques like PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow for rapid and accurate identification of genetic mutations. Prenatal genetic testing, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, enables detection of certain genetic disorders in the developing fetus. Genetic counseling plays a vital role in helping individuals and families understand the risks of inheriting or passing on genetic disorders. Counsellors provide information about testing options, inheritance patterns, and available resources to support informed decision-making. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be performed during in vitro fertilization (IVF) to screen embryos for specific genetic disorders before implantation.", "normalised": "Diagnosis of genetic disorders has been revolutionized by advances in genetic testing.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment strategies for genetic disorders vary depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. While there is currently no cure for many genetic disorders, various therapies can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Gene therapy, an emerging field, aims to correct the underlying genetic defect by introducing functional genes into cells. Clinical trials are underway for gene therapies targeting various genetic disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and hemophilia. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is used to treat certain lysosomal storage disorders, such as Gaucher disease. This involves providing the missing or deficient enzyme to help break down accumulated substances. Pharmacological interventions, such as medications to manage symptoms and prevent complications, are also commonly used.", "normalised": "Treatment strategies for genetic disorders vary depending on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms.
