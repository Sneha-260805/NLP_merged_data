I'm trying to understand some concepts better, especially related to genetic disorders that are prevalent in India. For instance, I was reading about Thalassemia, and how common it is among certain communities. My doc, Dr. Patel at Breach Candy Hospital, mentioned that genetic testing is now becoming more accessible, which is great news.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I have been reading up on genetics lately and it is seriously blowing my mind.

{"unnormalised": "Has anyone here gone for genetic counselling or testing, maybe at AIIMS or another hospital? I'm curious about the process. My concern is mainly about predispositions to certain diseases. My grandfather had type 2 diabetes, and my aunt has hypertension. Is it worth checking if I'm carrying genes that increase my risk? I’ve heard the tests can cost anywhere from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 25000 depending on the panel.", "normalised": "Has anyone here gone for genetic counselling or testing, maybe at A-I-I-M-S or another hospital?

{"unnormalised": "I was watching a YouTube video where some geneticist, Dr. Verma from PGI Chandigarh, was talking about personalized medicine. He mentioned how understanding your genetic makeup can help tailor treatment plans. It sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. He gave the example of some oncology treatment, which iirc, depended on a specific gene mutation.", "normalised": "I was watching a YouTube video where some geneticist, Doctor Verma from P-G-I Chandigarh, was talking about personalized medicine.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, how do you all feel about the future of genetics and personalized medicine in India? Do you think it will become more accessible and affordable in the years to come? I'm hoping that it will, as it could potentially revolutionize healthcare and improve the lives of millions. My grandma still uses ayurvedic remedies but I wonder what the future holds with customized medicine. Also, do you think insurance companies like ICICI Lombard will start covering some of these treatments? Just a random thought!", "normalised": "Finally, how do you all feel about the future of genetics and personalized medicine in India?
