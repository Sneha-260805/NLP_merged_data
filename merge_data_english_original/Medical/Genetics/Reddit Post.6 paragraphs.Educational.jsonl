{"unnormalised": "So, let's start with the basics. Think of your DNA as a huge instruction manual. Each section of this manual, called a gene, codes for a specific protein. These proteins are the workhorses of our cells. Now, genes come in different versions called alleles. Some alleles are dominant (uppercase letters, like \"B\") and some are recessive (lowercase letters, like \"b\"). If you inherit at least 1 dominant allele, you'll express that trait. If you inherit two recessive alleles (bb), then you’ll express the recessive trait. Makes sense? This is Mendelian genetics, the OG stuff.", "normalised": "So, let's start with the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Things get more complicated, though. Not all traits are determined by a single gene. Many are polygenic, meaning multiple genes contribute. Also, environmental factors play a role. This is why siblings can have different heights or susceptibilities to certain diseases, even though they share a significant portion of their DNA. For example, someone might have a genetic predisposition for diabetes, but if they maintain a healthy lifestyle, they might never develop the disease. It’s a nature vs. nurture thing, basically.", "normalised": "Things get more complicated, though. Not all traits are determined by a single gene.

{"unnormalised": "Mutations are another key concept. These are changes in your DNA sequence. Some mutations are harmless, while others can lead to genetic disorders. We have things like Point Mutations, Frame Shift Mutations, Chromosomal Mutations. Remember that mutations can be spontaneous or caused by environmental factors, like exposure to radiation. For example, the Chernobyl accident increased the incidence of certain cancers due to radiation-induced mutations.", "normalised": "Mutations are another key concept.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing is becoming increasingly common, and it's really revolutionized medical practice. You can get tested to see if you're a carrier for certain genetic diseases, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) allows couples undergoing IVF to screen embryos for genetic abnormalities before implantation. This raises some ethical considerations, of course.", "normalised": "Genetic testing is becoming increasingly common, and it's really revolutionized medical practice.

{"unnormalised": "If you're really diving deep, look into epigenetics. It explores how environmental factors can alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Think of it as tiny chemical tags that turn genes \"on\" or \"off.\" These epigenetic changes can be inherited, adding another layer of complexity to the story. It's also good to keep up with Genome India Project, which aims to create a reference genome database capturing the genetic diversity in the Indian population. I hope this helps, all the best to those studying!", "normalised": "If you're really diving deep, look into epigenetics.
