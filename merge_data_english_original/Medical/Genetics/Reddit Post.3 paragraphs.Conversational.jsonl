{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some advice! My family has a history of heart problems. My grandfather died at 65 from a heart attack, and my father had bypass surgery at just 50 yrs old. I'm only 30, but kinda worried about my chances of developing something similar. I know lifestyle plays a role, but how much does genetics actually contribute? I've read articles saying stuff like \"50% heritability\" but I don't really understand what that means in practice. Is there any genetic testing available in India that can actually tell me something useful? Specifically, I'm based out of Bangalore, any leads would be appreciated!", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some advice! My family has a history of heart problems.

{"unnormalised": "I’ve seen some ads online for “gene mapping” and personalized medicine based on genetic profiles, but they all seem super expensive, like ₹25,000 or more. Are these scams? Or are they actually worth it? My GP, Dr. Rao, suggested I focus on diet and exercise, which I am doing, but I feel like knowing my genetic risk would help me be even more proactive. Plus, knowing could also help my younger brother, he is only 25 years old.", "normalised": "I’ve seen some ads online for “gene mapping” and personalized medicine based on genetic profiles, but they all seem super expensive, like rupee twenty five thousand or more.

Also, are there any good resources or websites I should check out to learn more about genetics and heart disease in simple terms? Maybe something like a website made by AIIMS or similar? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks bhai log!", "normalised": "Has anyone here actually gotten genetic testing done related to heart health, or even other genetic predispositions?
