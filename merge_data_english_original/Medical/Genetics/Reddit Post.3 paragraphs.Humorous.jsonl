Grandma had diabetes, grandpa had his ticker acting up, and I'm pretty sure my 2nd cousin twice removed spontaneously combusted (probably some rare genetic mutation, tbh). So naturally, I'm a hypochondriac supreme. Went to Dr. Sharma last week for a check-up and he started talking about BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes... Suddenly I'm convinced I'm gonna get hit by a meteor AND develop cancer at the same time. Talk about winning the genetic lottery, NOT!", "normalised": "Okay folks, genetics is a trip, right?
