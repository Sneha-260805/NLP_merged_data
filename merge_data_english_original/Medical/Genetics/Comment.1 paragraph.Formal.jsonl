Dr. Sharma at AIIMS is leading research on this, and initial findings suggest that early detection using such genetic markers can significantly improve patient outcomes. The ICMR guidelines also highlight the importance of pre- and post-test counselling for individuals undergoing genetic screening, as understanding the implications of a positive or negative result is paramount.", "normalised": "Regarding the recent article, it's crucial to note that genetic testing for B-R-C-A one and B-R-C-A two mutations should be accessible, ideally costing under rupee five thousand, given its relevance in predicting breast cancer risk among women, especially those with a family history.
