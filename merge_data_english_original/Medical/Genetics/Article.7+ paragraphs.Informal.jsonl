Imagine knowing you have a higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes early on. You could make lifestyle changes, like eating healthier and exercising regularly, to significantly reduce your risk. That's the power of understanding your genetic makeup. Like, Dr. Agarwal at AIIMS, Delhi, did a presentation on this; apparently early detection is half the battle won!", "normalised": "So, what is the big deal?

Direct-to-consumer genetic tests, like those from companies like AncestryDNA, are becoming increasingly popular, but it's impt to remember that they are not always accurate and should be interpreted with caution.

{"unnormalised": "In India, we face some unique challenges when it comes to genetic testing. For example, there's a lack of awareness about genetic disorders in many rural areas. Plus, genetic testing can be expensive, making it inaccessible to many people. The cost can range anywhere from ₹5000 for a single-gene test to ₹50,000+ for whole-genome sequencing.
