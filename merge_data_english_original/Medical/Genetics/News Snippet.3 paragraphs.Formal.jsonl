{"unnormalised": "New research from AIIMS Delhi sheds light on genetic predispositions to Type 2 Diabetes within specific Indian subpopulations. The study, published in the journal \"Genetics India,\" identifies key genetic markers prevalent among individuals of North Indian descent, particularly those with a family history of the disease. Researchers analysed data from over 5000 participants and found a significant correlation between the SNP rs1234567 and increased diabetes risk.", "normalised": "New research from A-I-I-M-S Delhi sheds light on genetic predispositions to Type two Diabetes within specific Indian subpopulations. The study, published in the journal \"Genetics India,\" identifies key genetic markers prevalent among individuals of North Indian descent, particularly those with a family history of the disease. Researchers analysed data from over five thousand participants and found a significant correlation between the S-N-P R-S one two three four five six seven and increased diabetes risk."}
{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma, the lead author, stated that these findings have implications for preventative care strategies. He suggested that individuals with this genetic marker could benefit from early lifestyle interventions, such as dietary changes and regular exercise. Further research is underway to investigate the role of other genetic factors, incl. the gene ABC1, and their interaction with environmental influences, like diet & pollution levels in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, the lead author, stated that these findings have implications for preventative care strategies.

The cost of a full genome sequence is currently Rs. 15,000 at AIIMS, which is a barrier to widespread screening, but researchers hope prices will reduce to below Rs. 5,000 soon. This research contributes to a better understanding of the genetic landscape of diabetes in India and may ultimately lead to more personalized and effective treatment approaches.", "normalised": "The study also highlights the need for more comprehensive genetic databases reflecting the diversity of the Indian population. The cost of a full genome sequence is currently rupee fifteen thousand at A-I-I-M-S, which is a barrier to widespread screening, but researchers hope prices will reduce to below rupee five thousand soon. This research contributes to a better understanding of the genetic landscape of diabetes in India and may ultimately lead to more personalized and effective treatment approaches."}
