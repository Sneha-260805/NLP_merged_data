{"unnormalised": "Genetic disorders, often shrouded in complexity, are increasingly prevalent in India. Understanding the basics of genetics and their implications for health is crucial. Many diseases are directly linked to gene mutations or chromosomal abnormalities. For example, Thalassemia, particularly common in certain Indian communities, is caused by a mutation in genes responsible for hemoglobin production. Early diagnosis via techniques like PCR can significantly improve patient outcomes.", "normalised": "Genetic disorders, often shrouded in complexity, are increasingly prevalent in India.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing is revolutionizing healthcare, but accessibility remains a challenge. Prenatal screening, like amniocentesis performed around 15-20 weeks of gestation, can detect chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). However, the cost of these tests, averaging around Rs. 8000-15000 in private labs, often puts them out of reach for many families. Moreover, the availability of genetic counselors, vital for interpreting test results and providing support, is limited, particularly in rural areas.", "normalised": "Genetic testing is revolutionizing healthcare, but accessibility remains a challenge. Prenatal screening, like amniocentesis performed around fifteen to twenty weeks of gestation, can detect chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome (Trisomy twenty one). However, the cost of these tests, averaging around rupee eight thousand to fifteen thousand in private labs, often puts them out of reach for many families. Moreover, the availability of genetic counselors, vital for interpreting test results and providing support, is limited, particularly in rural areas."}
{"unnormalised": "Consanguineous marriages, a practice still prevalent in some regions of India, increase the risk of autosomal recessive disorders. Conditions like Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Cystic Fibrosis are more likely to manifest in offspring of closely related parents. Genetic counseling is therefore particularly important in these communities to educate couples about the risks involved and to offer testing options. A carrier screening test might cost about ₹ 3500-6000.", "normalised": "Consanguineous marriages, a practice still prevalent in some regions of India, increase the risk of autosomal recessive disorders. Conditions like Spinal Muscular Atrophy (S-M-A) and Cystic Fibrosis are more likely to manifest in offspring of closely related parents. Genetic counseling is therefore particularly important in these communities to educate couples about the risks involved and to offer testing options. A carrier screening test might cost about rupee three thousand five hundred to six thousand."}
{"unnormalised": "The role of genetic predisposition in common diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is also being increasingly recognized. While lifestyle factors play a significant role, genetic variants can increase an individual's susceptibility. Polygenic risk scores, which assess the cumulative effect of multiple genetic variants, are being developed to identify individuals at higher risk and to tailor preventive strategies. Dr. Meera Patel at AIIMS Delhi is currently leading a study on this topic.", "normalised": "The role of genetic predisposition in common diseases like Type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease is also being increasingly recognized.

Issues such as data privacy, potential discrimination based on genetic information, and informed consent need careful consideration. The Personal Data Protection Bill aims to address some of these concerns, but more comprehensive regulations are needed to ensure responsible use of genetic technologies.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, genetics is rapidly transforming healthcare in India. By promoting awareness, improving access to testing, and addressing ethical concerns, we can harness the power of genetics to improve health outcomes for all. Further research and investment in infrastructure are essential to ensure that the benefits of genetic medicine reach the most vulnerable populations.", "normalised": "In conclusion, genetics is rapidly transforming healthcare in India.
