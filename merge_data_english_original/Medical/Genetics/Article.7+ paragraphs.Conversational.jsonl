{"unnormalised": "Essentially, genetic testing analyzes your DNA – that unique blueprint you inherited from your parents. It can identify variations in your genes that might increase your risk of developing certain diseases or conditions. Think of it like getting a peek into your body's potential future health challenges. For instance, knowing you have a specific gene variant linked to heart disease allows you to make lifestyle changes early on, potentially delaying or even preventing the onset.", "normalised": "Essentially, genetic testing analyzes your D-N-A – that unique blueprint you inherited from your parents.

{"unnormalised": "Now, there are various types of genetic tests available. Pre-natal screening, like the NIPT test (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing), is pretty common these days. It’s used to check for chromosomal abnormalities, like Down syndrome, in the fetus. Many expecting parents in cities like Mumbai and Delhi are opting for these tests during the 1st trimester. Then there are carrier screenings, which determine if you and your partner carry genes for conditions like thalassemia or cystic fibrosis. If both of you are carriers, there's a higher chance your child could inherit the condition.", "normalised": "Now, there are various types of genetic tests available.

{"unnormalised": "Another area where genetic testing is making a big impact is in cancer treatment. Oncologists are using genetic information to personalize treatment plans for patients. For example, a test called BRCA1 and BRCA2 can determine if someone has inherited a higher risk of breast or ovarian cancer. This knowledge can then guide decisions about preventative measures or targeted therapies. Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS, New Delhi, is a leading expert in this field, frequently citing studies showing the benefits of personalized cancer care based on genetic profiles. He also stresses the importance of understanding the implications of these tests and ensuring proper counseling.", "normalised": "Another area where genetic testing is making a big impact is in cancer treatment.

What if an insurance company denies you coverage based on your genetic predisposition to a certain disease? What if employers discriminate against you? These are serious questions that need to be addressed. India needs robust regulations to protect individuals from genetic discrimination. Maybe something along the lines of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the US, but tailored to the Indian context.", "normalised": "However, it's not all sunshine and roses.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the future looking like? Well, genetic testing is only going to become more prevalent. As technology advances, the cost will likely come down, and more and more people will have access to this powerful tool. Imagine a future where everyone has their genome sequenced at birth, and healthcare is truly personalized based on your individual genetic makeup. It's a bit of a utopian vision, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility. Just remember to always consult with a qualified medical professional, like a genetic counselor, to understand the benefits, limitations, and ethical implications of any genetic test before making any decisions.
