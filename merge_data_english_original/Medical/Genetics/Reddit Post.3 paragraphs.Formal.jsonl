{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for some insights on genetic testing options available in India. My family has a history of cardiac issues, specifically hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). My grandfather and an uncle both passed away from it at relatively young ages, so my cardiologist, Dr. Mehra at AIIMS, strongly recommended genetic screening. I'm a bit overwhelmed by the choices. I have seen online resources which mentioned the cost for genetic testing for HCM is between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 25,000 depending on lab and type of test.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I am looking for some insights on genetic testing options available in India.

{"unnormalised": "I was reading up on various labs and tests. I noticed many labs offer whole exome sequencing (WES) but it sounds overkill to only check for HCM. Also, I'm not sure about the cost benefit ratio considering I only need to check for a few genes related to HCM. Any suggestions on reputable labs in India offering targeted genetic testing for HCM? I'd ideally like a lab with experience in cardiology-related genetic mutations. If any of you have experience with specific tests, like the MyoSeq test or similar, please share your thoughts. I'm located in Bangalore, but I'm open to sending samples elsewhere if the expertise is better.", "normalised": "I was reading up on various labs and tests.

Has anyone successfully claimed insurance for preventative genetic screening in India? Any pointers on the documentation I need to submit? I am insured for 5 lakh rupees per annum by Star Health.
