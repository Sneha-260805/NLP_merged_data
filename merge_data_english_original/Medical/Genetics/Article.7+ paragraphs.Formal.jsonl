{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing has become increasingly accessible in India, offered by both public and private institutions. Diagnostic labs like SRL Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare provide a range of tests, from basic karyotyping to advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS). The cost of these tests, however, remains a barrier for many, with NGS panels for cancer predisposition sometimes exceeding Rs. 50000. Govt initiatives, such as the National Health Mission, are attempting to address this disparity by subsidizing certain tests for specific populations.", "normalised": "Genetic testing has become increasingly accessible in India, offered by both public and private institutions.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major challenges in Indian genetics is the prevalence of consanguineous marriages, particularly in certain communities. This practice increases the risk of autosomal recessive disorders such as beta-thalassemia and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Carrier screening programs are vital but are not yet widely implemented. For instance, in some regions, the carrier frequency for beta-thalassemia can be as high as 3.2%. Genetic counselling services are also essential for informing couples about their risks and options. Dr. Aisha Khan, a leading genetic counsellor at AIIMS Delhi, emphasizes the importance of early intervention.", "normalised": "One of the major challenges in Indian genetics is the prevalence of consanguineous marriages, particularly in certain communities.

{"unnormalised": "The management of genetic disorders in India faces several hurdles. While treatments like bone marrow transplantation are available for certain conditions, they are often expensive and require specialized facilities. Gene therapy, a promising therapeutic avenue, is still in its nascent stages in India. Research into developing affordable and accessible therapies is crucial. Clinical trials exploring gene therapies for SMA and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are underway at select centers like CMC Vellore.", "normalised": "The management of genetic disorders in India faces several hurdles.

{"unnormalised": "Pharmacogenomics, the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs, is another emerging area of importance. In India, there is considerable variability in drug metabolism due to genetic polymorphisms. This variability can affect the efficacy and toxicity of medications. Tailoring drug dosages based on an individual's genetic profile could significantly improve treatment outcomes. For example, variations in the CYP2C19 gene can affect the metabolism of clopidogrel, a commonly used antiplatelet drug.", "normalised": "Pharmacogenomics, the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs, is another emerging area of importance.

While significant progress has been made in terms of diagnostic capabilities and research efforts, challenges remain in terms of accessibility, affordability, and ethical considerations. Continued investment in research, infrastructure, and education is essential to harness the full potential of genetics for improving the health and well-being of the Indian population. Future initiatives should focus on expanding carrier screening programs, developing affordable therapies, and establishing robust ethical guidelines.", "normalised": "In conclusion, genetics plays an increasingly important role in Indian medicine.
