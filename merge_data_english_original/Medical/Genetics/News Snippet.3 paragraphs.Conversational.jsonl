The genetic marker was located on chromosome 17 and designated as 'GeneX-IN'. Further research will focus on developing targeted therapies, possibly gene therapy, to correct the mutation. A nationwide screening program, costing ~Rs. 5 crore, is being proposed.", "normalised": "The study, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Genetics (I-J-M-G), involved analyzing the genomes of fifteen families affected by M-D-X.
