{"unnormalised": "It all started with 23andMe. You know, spit in a tube, wait a few weeks, and suddenly you’re an expert on your own genetic baggage. Or, at least, you *think* you are. My results came back, and apparently, I'm 2.3% Neanderthal. Now, I’m not saying I suddenly understand why I crave cave paintings and have a disproportionate love for mammoth steaks (hypothetically), but… *maybe*? Also, I have a heightened risk for Male Pattern Baldness. Thanks, genetics. Really appreciate that. I'm embracing the \"Vin Diesel\" look before it embraces me, which could happen by age 35 according to one website I Googled, so fun times ahead.", "normalised": "It all started with twenty three and M-e.

{"unnormalised": "Then things got REALLY interesting. I started looking into Mendelian inheritance. Remember those Punnett squares from high school biology? Yeah, well, they're not just for predicting pea plant color, turns out. My Auntie Meena swore she could predict the gender of her babies using some weird mathematical system. Apparently, it has something to do with which chromosome they are \"carrying\". So, I tried using Punnett squares to figure out if my future kids would have my receding hairline, my wife's uncanny ability to parallel park, or my dad's love of quoting poetry. Let's just say the results were… inconclusive. I think I created a genetic monster that would both be bald and be able to drive perfectly into spaces only a scooter should fit.", "normalised": "Then things got really interesting.

It sounds like robot wars more than scientific terminology. I even saw one called \"Sonic Hedgehog\" (SHH). I thought someone was punking me. But, no, apparently, it's crucial for embryonic development. My dreams now feature tiny, spiky hedgehogs building my future body. No wonder I wake up confused.
