Lately, I've been reading a lot about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, particularly their link to increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS mentioned in a recent paper that genetic testing is becoming more accessible, but awareness needs to improve, especially in tier 2 cities.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, wanted to share some insights on genetics, especially relevant given the increasing awareness about hereditary diseases in India.

For example, thalassemia is quite prevalent here, and it's important to know that both parents need to be carriers for a child to have the disease. So, if you're planning a family, especially if you have a family history, getting screened for common genetic conditions like thalassemia or sickle cell anemia can be crucial. A simple blood test can determine if you're a carrier. Consult a genetic counselor for more personalized advice.
