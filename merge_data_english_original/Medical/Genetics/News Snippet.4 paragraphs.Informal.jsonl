Apparently, it's linked to a specific gene mutation – SLC17A5, if I remember correctly from the press release. Symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, and other serious stuff. It's pretty devastating for the families involved.", "normalised": "A-I-I-M-S Delhi researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding a rare genetic disorder affecting kids in Bihar.

They're hoping this discovery will lead to better diagnostics and, eventually, targeted therapies. Right now, treatment options are limited, and it’s mostly about managing symptoms. It’s a long road, but this is a big step.", "normalised": "The research team, led by Doctor Gupta, analyzed the genetic data of twenty families affected by the disorder.

The team used cutting-edge technologies like NGS (next-generation sequencing) to pinpoint the exact mutation.
