{"unnormalised": "My younger sister, Aisha, was diagnosed with Beta Thalassemia Major when she was just 6 months old. Mom noticed she was always tired and pale. Our family doctor, Dr. Kumar, initially thought it was just iron deficiency, prescribed some supplements. But when things didn't improve, he recommended a blood test and that's when we got the diagnosis. I remember Mom being completely shattered. Dad, well, he just went into this problem-solving mode. Started researching everything he could find about Beta Thalassemia Major. He even reached out to specialists at AIIMS Delhi.", "normalised": "My younger sister, Aisha, was diagnosed with Beta Thalassemia Major when she was just six months old.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, Beta Thalassemia Major is a genetic blood disorder where your body doesn't produce enough haemoglobin. Aisha needed regular blood transfusions, every 3 weeks or so, to stay alive. This was back in 2005-ish. The constant trips to the hospital, the worry about reactions to the blood, it was tough on all of us, especially Aisha. She missed a lot of school, couldn't play like other kids. We lived in Lucknow then, and the local hospital, KGMC, was good, but it wasn't equipped to handle the long-term complications.", "normalised": "Basically, Beta Thalassemia Major is a genetic blood disorder where your body doesn't produce enough haemoglobin.

{"unnormalised": "Dad kept pushing for a more permanent solution. He learned about bone marrow transplants, which offered a potential cure. Finding a matching donor was the hard part. Luckily, I was a perfect match! I was 12 at the time, and honestly, pretty scared about the whole procedure. I remember Dr. Verma, who was heading the transplant team, explaining everything in detail. He said the transplant had a 70-80% success rate in cases like Aisha's.", "normalised": "Dad kept pushing for a more permanent solution.

{"unnormalised": "The transplant happened in 2008 at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore. It was a long and grueling process. Both Aisha and I had to undergo weeks of preparation.

It felt like holding my breath for days afterwards.", "normalised": "The transplant happened in two thousand and eight at Christian Medical College (C-M-C) Vellore.
