Dr. Rajesh Kumar led the study, which analyzed the genomes of 2,000 individuals, revealing that those with the 'IN-D123' variant on chromosome 7 had a significantly higher risk.

Initial findings indicate that IN-D123 disrupts the normal functioning of pancreatic beta cells. More trials are planned in other regions of India to confirm these initial findings. BTW, the full research paper is expected to be published in the 'Indian Journal of Medical Research' by 15/12/2024.", "normalised": "The research team, including members from C-M-C Vellore, focused specifically on genes related to insulin production and glucose metabolism.
