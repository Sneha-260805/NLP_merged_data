It's more like a risk factor that, combined with lifestyle choices (like your love for all things samosa), can nudge you in a certain direction.

{"unnormalised": "One thing I've learned is how certain genetic predispositions are more common in some communities than others. For instance, beta thalassemia is something I’ve heard about in friends with roots in certain parts of Gujarat & West Bengal.
