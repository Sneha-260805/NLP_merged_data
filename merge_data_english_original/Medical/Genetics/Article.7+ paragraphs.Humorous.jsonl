{"unnormalised": "For centuries, we blamed everything on karma or \"bhagwan ki marzi\". Now, we have scientific scapegoats – chromosomes, DNA, and those pesky recessive genes. Remember Mendelian genetics from high school? Dominant, recessive, blah blah. Turns out, life's a tad more complicated than just Punnett squares. As Dr. Anuradha Reddy at CMC Vellore told me the other day over chai, (and I quote loosely), \"It's a freakin' genetic jungle out there!\" I mean, she used slightly more professional language, but you get the gist.", "normalised": "For centuries, we blamed everything on karma or \"bhagwan ki marzi\".

Even your risk of catching COVID-19, or developing a severe case, has a genetic component. I read a study published in \"The Lancet\" where they claimed some genes had upto 70% impact on severity. Mind-blowing stuff!

{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing is all the rage these days. You can spit in a tube, mail it off to some lab in the US (for about $99, or Rs. 8200 these days!) and voila! A few weeks later, you get a report telling you your ancestry, your risk for certain diseases, and if you’re likely to be a morning person. Imagine, you can tell your boss that science prevents you from attending those 8 AM meetings!

You might have the \"sweet tooth\" gene, but you can still resist the urge to devour that entire box of \"gulab jamun\" (Okay, maybe just *most* of the box). And the interpretation of these genetic results is far from straightforward. A genetic counselor like Ms. Priya Kumar from AIIMS Delhi is your best bet to help interpret these reports.

It's the modern Indian solution to avoiding personal responsibility! But more importantly, remember that genetics is a powerful tool that is reshaping our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. It's complex, fascinating, and a little bit scary – kind of like navigating the Delhi Metro during rush hour. Just don't forget that even with the power of genetics, you're still responsible for your actions. Try not to blame it all on that DNA, alright? Especially around family – they probably heard the same excuse last Diwali!", "normalised": "So, next time you mess up a recipe, trip on the stairs, or generally just have a bad day, remember, you can always blame your genes.
