{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing availability in India has certainly improved, but accessibility can still be a challenge for many. Major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai have advanced facilities at hospitals like AIIMS and Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore, offering a wide range of tests. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, access is often limited, requiring patients to travel to larger urban centers. Tests like prenatal screening for Down syndrome, BRCA gene testing for breast cancer risk, and diagnostic tests for conditions like Thalassemia are becoming increasingly common. Many private labs, such as SRL Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare, also offer various genetic tests.", "normalised": "Genetic testing availability in India has certainly improved, but accessibility can still be a challenge for many.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of genetic testing varies widely depending on the type of test. A basic karyotype test may cost around Rs. 3,000-5,000, while more advanced tests like whole-exome sequencing (WES) can range from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 or even more, depending on the lab and the extent of analysis. Some government hospitals and research institutions offer subsidized testing, but these are often limited to specific conditions or research projects. The National Institute of Immunohaematology (NIIH) in Mumbai, for instance, sometimes offers subsidized testing for blood disorders. It's recommended to consult with a genetic counselor, like those at Dr. Batra's Positive Health Clinic to understand the best test and navigate financial options.", "normalised": "The cost of genetic testing varies widely depending on the type of test.

{"unnormalised": "Insurance coverage for genetic testing in India is still evolving. Some policies may cover specific tests if they are deemed medically necessary, but coverage is not universal. It's best to check with your insurance provider regarding the specifics of your policy. Furthermore, certain NGOs and patient advocacy groups can provide financial assistance or connect you with resources to help cover the costs. Keep in mind the potential out-of-pocket expenses, ranging from ₹3000 to ₹50000, and factor this into your healthcare planning, particularly if there is a family history of genetic disorders.", "normalised": "Insurance coverage for genetic testing in India is still evolving.
