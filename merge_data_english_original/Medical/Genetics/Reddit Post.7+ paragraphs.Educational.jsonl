{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I've been diving deep into genetics lately and wanted to share some stuff I've learned, especially in the Indian context. Genetics isn't just about what colour your eyes are, it's WAY more than that! It's about understanding how diseases like Thalassemia and Sickle cell anemia are passed down. Sadly, both diseases are prevalent in certain Indian communities. Knowing your genetic risks can seriously help with planning for the future.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I've been diving deep into genetics lately and wanted to share some stuff I've learned, especially in the Indian context.

{"unnormalised": "Firstly, genetic testing is becoming increasingly common. Places like Dr. Lal PathLabs and SRL Diagnostics offer a range of genetic tests. You can even find smaller labs providing specific tests like BRCA 1/2 for breast cancer risk at a lower cost, say Rs. 5000-8000. These tests can reveal a lot about your predisposition to certain conditions. It's not just about knowing if you *have* a disease, but also if you're a carrier and could potentially pass it on to your kids. Think of it as preventative healthcare.", "normalised": "Firstly, genetic testing is becoming increasingly common.

{"unnormalised": "Prenatal screening is another big area. Doctors like Dr. Mehra in Delhi often recommend Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to expectant parents. NIPT can detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome very early in pregnancy, sometimes as early as 10 weeks. Previously, amniocentesis was the only available option. NIPT is far less risky and non-invasive, costing around Rs. 15000-25000 depending on where you get it done. It gives parents the ability to make informed decisions and prep themselves for whatever comes next.", "normalised": "Prenatal screening is another big area. Doctors like Doctor Mehra in Delhi often recommend Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (N-I-P-T) to expectant parents. N-I-P-T can detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome very early in pregnancy, sometimes as early as ten weeks. Previously, amniocentesis was the only available option. N-I-P-T is far less risky and non-invasive, costing around rupee fifteen thousand to twenty five thousand depending on where you get it done. It gives parents the ability to make informed decisions and prep themselves for whatever comes next."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's pharmacogenomics, which is really cool. Basically, it's tailoring medication to your genes. So, for example, someone with a certain gene variant might not respond well to a common antidepressant. Pharmacogenomic testing, priced anywhere from Rs 2000 - Rs 10000, can identify these variants and help doctors prescribe the most effective treatment right away, minimizing side effects and improving outcomes. Imagine how efficient that would be.", "normalised": "Then there's pharmacogenomics, which is really cool. Basically, it's tailoring medication to your genes.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic counselling is crucial. If you're considering genetic testing, it's best to consult with a genetic counsellor. They can explain the risks and benefits of testing, interpret the results, and help you understand what they mean for you and your family. You will find genetic counsellors affiliated with most large hospitals such as AIIMS or CMC Vellore. They will discuss the implications of the test and guide you. Often a consultation will cost you around Rs. 500-1500/hr.", "normalised": "Genetic counselling is crucial. If you're considering genetic testing, it's best to consult with a genetic counsellor.
