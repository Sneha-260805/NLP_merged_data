{"unnormalised": "Apparently, it’s something that’s been in our family line. My great-grandmother, Dadi, showed similar symptoms late in life, but back then (early 1950s) they just said she was getting \"old.\" No genetic testing, no real understanding. Then, my uncle, Mama ji, had a milder version, diagnosed in 2005 as chronic fatigue syndrome before they did genetic screening for everything. Now it looks like it was probably the same thing. The doctor said the chances of passing it on are pretty high, especially through the maternal line.", "normalised": "Apparently, it’s something that’s been in our family line.

The thought of passing this on to our child… it’s gut-wrenching. They mentioned PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) as an option if we go the IVF route. That’s sounds expensive.
