{"unnormalised": "My fascination with genetics started with a seemingly simple question: why did my nani always insist I drink haldi doodh? It wasn't just the taste (which, let's be honest, isn't everyone's cup of chai), but the underlying belief in its healing properties. That seed of curiosity grew into a full-blown obsession after reading an article about the Human Genome Project. I remember thinking, \"Wow, they've mapped the entire thing? What does it all *mean*?\"", "normalised": "My fascination with genetics started with a seemingly simple question: why did my nani always insist I drink haldi doodh?

{"unnormalised": "My formal foray began during my MBBS studies at AIIMS, Delhi. Professor Sharma’s lectures on Mendelian genetics were riveting. He’d often cite examples of diseases prevalent in India, linking them to specific gene mutations. The textbook mentioned something about a 23andMe kit and I figured, why not give it a go? After all, couldn't hurt to know what lurks in my desi DNA.", "normalised": "My formal foray began during my M-B-B-S studies at A-I-I-M-S, Delhi.

{"unnormalised": "So, I ordered a DNA testing kit online - it cost about Rs. 7500 (excluding shipping) - and eagerly awaited its arrival. The whole process felt surprisingly futuristic. Swabbing my cheek, packaging the sample, and sending it off to the lab felt like something out of a sci-fi movie. Then came the agonizing wait of approx. 6 weeks for the results.", "normalised": "So, I ordered a D-N-A testing kit online - it cost about rupee seven thousand five hundred (excluding shipping) - and eagerly awaited its arrival.

{"unnormalised": "The results were…well, a mixed bag. I discovered I had a higher-than-average predisposition to lactose intolerance (explains the occasional digestive distress after indulging in gulab jamun!). The report indicated a gene variant linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. This was a bit of a wake-up call. My family has a history of diabetes, and the results underscored the importance of preventive measures like diet and exercise. It also highlighted my ancestry’s links to the Indus Valley Civilization, with 65% of my genetic makeup aligning with South Asian populations.", "normalised": "The results were…well, a mixed bag.

{"unnormalised": "The really interesting part was the genetic predisposition to certain drug responses. Turns out, I might react differently to certain medications compared to someone of European descent. I also learnt that I have a slightly higher risk of developing a vitamin D deficiency, which many Indians have. This is super relevant, especially considering I’m practicing medicine!", "normalised": "The really interesting part was the genetic predisposition to certain drug responses.

{"unnormalised": "My genetic journey isn't just a personal quest. It highlights the need for more comprehensive genetic databases that accurately reflect the Indian population. Most genetic studies are still heavily skewed towards European ancestry, leaving out significant segments of the global population. More research is needed to uncover the unique genetic landscape of India and its implications for personalized medicine, tailored healthcare, and ultimately, a healthier future for everyone, bhai.", "normalised": "My genetic journey isn't just a personal quest.
