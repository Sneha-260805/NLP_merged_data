{"unnormalised": "At its core, genetics is the study of heredity – how traits are passed down from parents to offspring. Think about it: why do some children inherit their father's height or their mother's eye color? The answer lies in our genes, which are like tiny instruction manuals encoded in our DNA. Each of us has approx. 20,000-25,000 genes.", "normalised": "At its core, genetics is the study of heredity – how traits are passed down from parents to offspring. Think about it: why do some children inherit their father's height or their mother's eye color? The answer lies in our genes, which are like tiny instruction manuals encoded in our D-N-A. Each of us has approximately twenty thousand to twenty five thousand genes."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, you might be wondering, what exactly is DNA? DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries our genetic information. It's shaped like a twisted ladder, often referred to as a double helix. The rungs of this ladder are made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The sequence of these bases determines our unique genetic code. Scientists at CDFD, Hyderabad are working on various research projects focused on genetic sequencing.", "normalised": "Now, you might be wondering, what exactly is D-N-A?

{"unnormalised": "Genes, then, are specific segments of DNA that contain the instructions for building proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of our cells, carrying out a vast array of functions, from transporting oxygen in our blood to building our muscles. A mutation in a gene, say a change in the sequence of A, T, G, or C, can sometimes lead to a faulty protein, which can contribute to disease.", "normalised": "Genes, then, are specific segments of D-N-A that contain the instructions for building proteins.

{"unnormalised": "One area of genetics that's becoming increasingly important is personalized medicine. This approach uses an individual's genetic information to tailor their medical treatment. For example, a genetic test might reveal that a person is more likely to respond to a particular drug or that they have a higher risk of developing a certain disease. Many hospitals like AIIMS are offering genetic counseling.", "normalised": "One area of genetics that's becoming increasingly important is personalized medicine.

{"unnormalised": "Consider thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder common in India. Individuals with thalassemia inherit faulty genes from their parents, leading to reduced production of hemoglobin. Early genetic testing can help identify carriers of the thalassemia gene, allowing couples to make informed decisions about family planning. Prenatal tests are often conducted around the 12th week of pregnancy.", "normalised": "Consider thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder common in India.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic screening can also help identify individuals at risk of developing certain cancers, such as breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, for instance, have a significantly higher risk of developing these cancers. Knowing this information can empower them to take proactive steps, such as undergoing regular screenings or considering preventative surgery.", "normalised": "Genetic screening can also help identify individuals at risk of developing certain cancers, such as breast cancer or ovarian cancer.

{"unnormalised": "Another exciting area of genetics is gene therapy. This involves introducing new or modified genes into a patient's cells to treat or prevent disease. While gene therapy is still in its early stages, it holds tremendous promise for treating a wide range of genetic disorders. Clinical trials are underway at various medical institutions in India, like CMC Vellore, investigating the effectiveness of gene therapy for conditions like spinal muscular atrophy.", "normalised": "Another exciting area of genetics is gene therapy.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about some common genetic terms you might encounter. \"Homozygous\" refers to having two identical copies of a gene, while \"heterozygous\" means having two different copies. \"Dominant\" genes are those that express their trait even when only one copy is present, while \"recessive\" genes require two copies to be expressed. Understanding these terms can help you better interpret genetic test results.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about some common genetic terms you might encounter. \"Homozygous\" refers to having two identical copies of a gene, while \"heterozygous\" means having two different copies. \"Dominant\" genes are those that express their trait even when only one copy is present, while \"recessive\" genes require two copies to be expressed.
