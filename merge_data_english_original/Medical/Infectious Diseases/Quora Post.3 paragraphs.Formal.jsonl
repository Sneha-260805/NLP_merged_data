{"unnormalised": "India faces several infectious disease challenges. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant concern, with a high prevalence, particularly in densely populated areas. Malaria and dengue fever are also endemic, especially during the monsoon season. Cases often spike between the months of July & October. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is actively working to mitigate these. Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and cholera continue to pose risks, often linked to poor sanitation and contaminated water sources. Recently, there have also been concerns regarding H1N1 influenza (swine flu), particularly during winter months. Consulting a qualified medical professional like Dr. Rajesh Kumar is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.", "normalised": "India faces several infectious disease challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Prevention is key. Vaccination is highly recommended for diseases like measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and hepatitis B. Maintaining good hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing with soap and water, is essential, especially after using public transportation or before meals. Avoiding crowded places during peak transmission seasons can also reduce risk. Ensuring safe drinking water, whether through boiling, filtration, or using water purification tablets, is vital. For mosquito-borne diseases, using mosquito nets, repellents (such as Odomos), and eliminating stagnant water sources around homes and communities are critical preventive measures. A dose of Doxycycline 100mg might be prescribed by your doctor when travelling to malaria prone areas.", "normalised": "Prevention is key.
