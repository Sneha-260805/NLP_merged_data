{"unnormalised": "Guys, seriously worried. Doc just said I might have contracted Chickenpox from my nephew. Like, who even gets Chickenpox at 25? I thought that was a kids thing! Now I'm all itchy and covered in spots like some dalmatian gone wrong. Dr. Sharma prescribed calamine lotion and some Acyclovir 800mg. Anyone got any home remedies that actually work? Desperate times call for desperate measures, especially before my cousin's wedding on 12/12/2024!", "normalised": "Guys, seriously worried.

Apparently, my presence is a biohazard now. She's making me drink turmeric milk by the gallon, claiming it's an ancient Ayurvedic cure. It tastes like sadness and regret. Pls tell me this nightmare ends soon. I can't even binge-watch Netflix properly with this itching!", "normalised": "On a scale of one to \"watching Govinda movies on repeat,\" how contagious am I?

{"unnormalised": "So, yeah, wish me luck battling the dreaded Chickenpox. Any tips for avoiding scratching in my sleep? Or should I just accept my fate as a human scratch post? Maybe I can start a support group: \"Adults vs. Chickenpox: We thought we were immune, but the pox had other plans.\" BTW, AIIMS Delhi says the incubation period is 10-21 days. Thanks a lot, science, for the helpful info *after* I'm infected. Smh.", "normalised": "So, yeah, wish me luck battling the dreaded Chickenpox. Any tips for avoiding scratching in my sleep?
