Symptoms can include a persistent cough lasting 3+ weeks, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Diagnosis usually involves a chest X-ray and a sputum test. Treatment typically involves a course of antibiotics for 6 months. Another example is Typhoid fever which is often contracted through contaminated water, especially during monsoons. Consult with your doctor if you suspect you have Typhoid fever, taking self-prescribed medicines could be detrimental to your health.
