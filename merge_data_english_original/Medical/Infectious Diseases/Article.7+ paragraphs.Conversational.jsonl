{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *are* infectious diseases? Simply put, they're illnesses caused by microscopic organisms – viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. These little buggers can enter our bodies in various ways – through contaminated food, water, insect bites (mosquitoes are the worst!), or even just through the air we breathe. Think of the common cold or flu – those are prime examples. Also, did you know that somethings like HIV are also Infectious Diseases?", "normalised": "So, what exactly *are* infectious diseases?

{"unnormalised": "In India, the situation is a bit complicated. We have a high population density, especially in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, which means diseases can spread quickly. Monsoon season from June to September brings its own set of challenges, like waterborne diseases. Plus, factors like poverty and sanitation play a huge role. You might remember reading about the outbreak of cholera in some parts of Kolkata last year. It's really important to make sure our kids get their shots.", "normalised": "In India, the situation is a bit complicated.

{"unnormalised": "Let’s look at some common infectious diseases in India. Malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes, is a big one. Dengue is another mosquito-borne disease that can cause severe fever and joint pain. Typhoid fever, caused by contaminated food and water, is also prevalent. Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that usually affects the lungs, is a major public health concern. Remember that cough that doesn't go away after like, 2 weeks? Better get that checked out, just in case.", "normalised": "Let’s look at some common infectious diseases in India. Malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes, is a big one.

{"unnormalised": "What about prevention? Well, good hygiene is key. Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating. Drink clean, boiled water. Avoid eating street food from places that don't look too clean. Use mosquito nets and repellents, especially during the monsoon. And most importantly, get vaccinated. Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and your community from infectious diseases. Keep your vaccinations up-to-date, especially for your children. You can usually go to the local Govt. clinic to find the proper vaccines.", "normalised": "What about prevention? Well, good hygiene is key. Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating.
