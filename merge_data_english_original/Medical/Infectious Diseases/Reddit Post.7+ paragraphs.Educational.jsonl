{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *are* infectious diseases? Basically, they're illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms, like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Think of things like the flu, COVID-19, TB, or even something like athlete's foot. They can spread in a bunch of ways - through the air (coughing, sneezing), direct contact (touching someone who's infected), contaminated food or water, or even through insect bites. You might see terms like \"R0\" (R-naught) being used which describes how contagious a disease is. A higher R0 means it spreads more easily.", "normalised": "So, what exactly are infectious diseases?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about some common ones in the Indian context. Typhoid, for example, is caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria and often spreads through contaminated water. Places with poor sanitation are particularly vulnerable, so being careful about what you eat and drink is super important. Malaria, another big one, is transmitted by mosquitoes, mostly during the monsoon season. Dengue, also spread by mosquitoes, is a serious concern too, especially in urban areas like Delhi or Mumbai. You'll often see local municipality workers fogging areas with insecticides to control mosquito populations during those months.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about some common ones in the Indian context.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s TB (Tuberculosis), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily affects the lungs and spreads through airborne droplets when a person with active TB coughs or sneezes. Even something like the common cold, caused by viruses like Rhinovirus, spreads super easily, especially in crowded places like local trains or markets. The WHO estimates that 10.6 million people fell ill with TB in 2021. Many people delay going to the doc and try home remedies, which can sometimes make it worse.", "normalised": "Then there’s T-B (Tuberculosis), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

{"unnormalised": "Preventing these diseases isn’t rocket science, but it does require consistent effort. Vaccination is a huge one. Things like the BCG vaccine for TB, or the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, can provide excellent protection. Good hygiene is also crucial – washing your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, is a must. And, of course, clean drinking water is essential. If you're not sure about the source, boiling it or using a water filter is a good idea. Public awareness campaigns are also critical; you'll often see government ads on TV and radio promoting handwashing and sanitation practices.", "normalised": "Preventing these diseases isn’t rocket science, but it does require consistent effort.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment varies widely depending on the disease. Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections like typhoid or TB, while antiviral drugs are used for viral infections like influenza or COVID-19. Anti-fungal medications are prescribed for fungal infections. The specific treatment plan depends on the individual's condition, so it's vital to consult a qualified doctor (like Dr. Sharma at AIIMS) for proper diagnosis and treatment. Self-medication can be dangerous, so please avoid it. The cost of treatment can also vary, ranging from Rs. 500 for a doctor's visit to Rs. 50,000+ for hospitalization in a private hospital.", "normalised": "Treatment varies widely depending on the disease.
