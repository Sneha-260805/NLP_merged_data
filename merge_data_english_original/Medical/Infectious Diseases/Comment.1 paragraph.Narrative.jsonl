{"unnormalised": "My family went through a tough time last year. My younger brother, Rohan, got really sick. It started with a fever, and we thought it was just the flu. But Dr. Mehra at City Hospital diagnosed him with typhoid. He had to take antibiotics for 14 days, and we made sure he drank plenty of ORS solution. The worst part was seeing him so weak; he lost almost 5 kg. Thankfully, he recovered fully after a few weeks. We're extra careful about hygiene now, especially during monsoon season. Never thought an infectious disease could hit so close to home.", "normalised": "My family went through a tough time last year. My younger brother, Rohan, got really sick.
