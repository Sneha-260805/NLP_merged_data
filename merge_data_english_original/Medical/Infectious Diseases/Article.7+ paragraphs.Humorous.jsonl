{"unnormalised": "Alright, folks, let's talk about germs. Those microscopic party crashers that think your body is their personal all-inclusive resort. We're diving headfirst into the world of infectious diseases – those delightful ailments passed around faster than gossip at a shaadi. Now, before you reach for the hand sanitizer and live in a bubble (tempting, I know), let's approach this with a pinch of humor, shall we? After all, laughter is the best medicine… after actual medicine, of course.", "normalised": "Alright, folks, let's talk about germs.

{"unnormalised": "Think of infectious diseases as uninvited guests at the great Indian banquet of life. You've got your common cold, the distant relative who always shows up and coughs a little too loudly. Then there's the flu, the Bollywood drama queen who demands all your attention and leaves you feeling utterly exhausted. And let’s not forget Dengue; spread by mosquitoes, making you itchier than a politician trying to win votes before election.", "normalised": "Think of infectious diseases as uninvited guests at the great Indian banquet of life.

Some of these \"guests\" are less \"fun uncle\" and more \"evil villain.\" We're talking about the big guns like TB, which affected millions across India with the latest statistics showing over 2.6 million cases in 2022. Or the ever-sneaky COVID-19, who proved that even a mask can be a fashion statement (albeit a slightly depressing one). And remember the panic around H1N1?

We have the white coats, the Dr. Shah and Dr. Gupta types, armed with stethoscopes and prescriptions for Azithromycin 500mg. Then there's the miracle of vaccines, the preemptive strikes that train your immune system to kick butt before the bug even arrives. Get your flu shot, get your COVID booster, and maybe even consider a Tdap if you're feeling particularly proactive.

Think of it as your personal Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but for your body. Imagine, if everyone washed their hands as thoroughly as they check their phones, we'd probably eradicate half these diseases overnight.
