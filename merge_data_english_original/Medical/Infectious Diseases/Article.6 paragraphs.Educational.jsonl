{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent infectious diseases in India is Tuberculosis (TB). India accounts for ~26% of the world’s TB cases. TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs. Symptoms include persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Diagnosis typically involves a sputum test and chest X-ray. Treatment requires a course of antibiotics, often lasting for 6 months or more. Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) is a widely used strategy to ensure treatment adherence. The Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) aims to reduce the burden of TB in India.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent infectious diseases in India is Tuberculosis (T-B). India accounts for approximately twenty six percent of the world’s T-B cases. T-B is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs.

Treatment requires a course of antibiotics, often lasting for six months or more. Directly Observed Therapy (D-O-T-S) is a widely used strategy to ensure treatment adherence.

{"unnormalised": "Another major concern is waterborne diseases. Cholera, typhoid fever, and hepatitis A are common due to contaminated water sources. Symptoms vary but often include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice. Prevention strategies include access to clean drinking water, proper sanitation, and vaccination where available. For example, Typhoid vaccine has ~70% efficacy. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are essential for managing dehydration caused by diarrheal diseases. Boiling water for 1 minute can kill most harmful bacteria and viruses.", "normalised": "Another major concern is waterborne diseases.

{"unnormalised": "Vector-borne diseases also pose a significant threat. Dengue fever, malaria, and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes. Symptoms include high fever, headache, joint pain, and rash. Prevention involves controlling mosquito populations through insecticide spraying, eliminating stagnant water, and using mosquito nets and repellents. In 2023, Delhi reported >2000 cases of Dengue. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) implements strategies to control these diseases.", "normalised": "Vector-borne diseases also pose a significant threat.

{"unnormalised": "Respiratory infections, such as influenza and pneumonia, are also common. Influenza is caused by viruses and spreads through respiratory droplets. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and affects the lungs. Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia is recommended, especially for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Maintaining good hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washing, can help prevent the spread of respiratory infections.", "normalised": "Respiratory infections, such as influenza and pneumonia, are also common.

This includes improving sanitation and hygiene, providing access to clean drinking water, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, promoting vaccination, and educating the public about preventive measures. Public health campaigns, such as those promoting hand washing and safe food handling practices, play a crucial role in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases. Early detection, prompt treatment, and community participation are essential for achieving a healthier India.
