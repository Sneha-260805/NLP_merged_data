TB continues to be a major public health challenge, with India accounting for a significant proportion of the global TB burden. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), now known as the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP), has been instrumental in reducing TB incidence and mortality rates. However, challenges persist in the form of drug-resistant TB strains, such as MDR-TB and XDR-TB, which require more complex and expensive treatment regimens. As of 2023, India had an estimated 2.6 million TB cases, highlighting the need for intensified efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of eliminating TB by 2025.", "normalised": "Several infectious diseases are endemic to India, including tuberculosis (T-B), malaria, dengue fever, and enteric fever (typhoid).

Malaria, transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, is prevalent in several states, particularly in rural and tribal areas. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) implements various strategies for malaria control, including insecticide spraying, distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and early diagnosis and treatment. Dengue fever, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has witnessed a surge in cases in recent years, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas. The symptoms of dengue range from mild fever and body aches to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Effective vector control measures, community awareness campaigns, and timely clinical management are crucial for mitigating the impact of dengue outbreaks. The reported dengue cases in Delhi NCR alone touched 1500 between Jan and Oct '23.", "normalised": "Vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever also pose a substantial threat to public health.

Poor sanitation, contaminated water sources, and inadequate hygiene practices contribute to the transmission of these pathogens. Vaccination against typhoid fever is recommended for individuals residing in or traveling to endemic areas. Other infectious diseases of concern include viral hepatitis (A, B, C, and E), HIV/AIDS, and various respiratory infections.
