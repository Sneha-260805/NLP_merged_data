{"unnormalised": "Well, bhai, in India, we see a lot of infectious diseases. One very common one is TB (Tuberculosis). You'll often hear about it, especially in more crowded areas. Treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics, like Rifampicin, for about 6 months. Make sure you complete the full course, even if you feel better after 2 months! Then there's dengue fever, which is spread by mosquitoes. You’ll usually have high fever and joint pain. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS recommended lots of fluids and Paracetamol 650mg for the fever.", "normalised": "Well, bhai, in India, we see a lot of infectious diseases.

{"unnormalised": "Another big one is malaria, again from mosquitoes. People often take Chloroquine as a preventative if they're travelling to affected areas. Typhoid fever is also quite prevalent, usually spread through contaminated food or water. Ciprofloxacin is a common treatment. Remember to always boil your water, especially if you're travelling! For any of these, it’s best to see a doc – like Dr. Khan at City Hospital – ASAP to get a proper diagnosis and prescription.", "normalised": "Another big one is malaria, again from mosquitoes.
