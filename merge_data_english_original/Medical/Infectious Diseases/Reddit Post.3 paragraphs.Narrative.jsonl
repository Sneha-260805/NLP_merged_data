Turns out, she caught some kind of nasty bug – Doc said it was likely a strain of viral influenza, possibly H3N2, spreading around Delhi. Honestly, the whole thing was a wake-up call. Never really thought about how easily these infectious diseases can spread, especially amongst elders.", "normalised": "So, my grandma, Dadi as we call her, just got discharged from A-I-I-M-S after a harrowing week.
