{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, so I've been feeling kinda off lately. Like, super tired and achy. Doc says it might be some kind of infectious disease doing the rounds, especially with the monsoon season and all the stagnant water. He ran some tests, waiting on the results now. Anyone else in Mumbai feeling this way? My neighbor, aunty Sharma, seems to have a similar thing going on, she's been down with a fever since 10/07/2024.", "normalised": "Hey guys, so I've been feeling kinda off lately.

{"unnormalised": "Doc mentioned it could be anything from dengue to chikungunya or even just a bad viral fever. He prescribed some Paracetamol 650mg for the fever and told me to drink lots of water. Also said to avoid street food, which is a bummer 'cause I was really craving some pani puri! He specifically told me to watch out for symptoms like a rash, joint pain, and a high fever above 102°F. Anyone have any tips on how to prepone my recovery?", "normalised": "Doc mentioned it could be anything from dengue to chikungunya or even just a bad viral fever.

Maybe some home remedies that actually work? And if you're feeling sick, get yourself checked out ASAP. Don't be like me and wait till you're practically bedridden.
