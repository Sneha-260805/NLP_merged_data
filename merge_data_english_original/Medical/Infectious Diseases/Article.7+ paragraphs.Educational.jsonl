{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent infectious diseases is Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. India accounts for a significant proportion of the global TB burden. Symptoms often include persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Diagnosis typically involves a sputum test and a chest X-ray. Treatment usually consists of a course of antibiotics lasting for at least 6 months. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has been instrumental in improving TB detection and treatment outcomes across the country. It is estimated that >40% of the population is infected with latent TB.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent infectious diseases is Tuberculosis (T-B), caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

{"unnormalised": "Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, is another major health challenge. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Common symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy are used for diagnosis. Treatment options include artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), are essential for preventing malaria transmission. Over 1 million cases were reported in 2023 as per the NVBDCP.", "normalised": "Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, is another major health challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, is increasingly common, particularly during the monsoon season. Symptoms range from mild fever and headache to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, such as NS1 antigen detection. Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on fluid management and pain relief. Preventing mosquito breeding by eliminating stagnant water sources is critical in controlling dengue outbreaks. The Delhi government reported 1,500 cases between 1st Jan and 31st July of the current year.", "normalised": "Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, is increasingly common, particularly during the monsoon season.

{"unnormalised": "Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium *Salmonella Typhi*, is often transmitted through contaminated food and water. Common symptoms include high fever, abdominal pain, headache, and constipation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by blood culture. Treatment involves antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin. Improved sanitation and hygiene practices, including proper handwashing and safe water handling, are crucial for preventing typhoid fever. Vaccination is also recommended, especially for travelers to endemic areas. Approx. 2 lakh cases are reported annually in India.", "normalised": "Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium *Salmonella Typhi*, is often transmitted through contaminated food and water.
