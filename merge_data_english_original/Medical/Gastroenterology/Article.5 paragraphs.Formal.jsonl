{"unnormalised": "Gastroenterology, a branch of medicine focused on the digestive system, faces unique challenges in India. With a diverse population and varying dietary habits, the prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders is significant. The lack of awareness and access to specialized medical care often leads to delayed diagnoses and complications. Recent studies indicate a rising incidence of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in urban areas, necessitating enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Dr. Rajesh Kumar, MD, DM (Gastroenterology) at AIIMS, Delhi, highlighted the need for community-based screening programs to address the growing burden of these diseases.", "normalised": "Gastroenterology, a branch of medicine focused on the digestive system, faces unique challenges in India.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major challenges is the high prevalence of infectious diseases affecting the GI tract. Conditions like typhoid fever and hepatitis A are still common, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation. In a study published in the Indian Journal of Gastroenterology, it was reported that approximately 35% of patients presenting with acute gastrointestinal symptoms were diagnosed with a waterborne infection. Effective preventative measures, including improved sanitation and widespread vaccination programs, are crucial in mitigating the impact of these infections. Additionally, the overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance, making treatment more challenging.", "normalised": "One of the major challenges is the high prevalence of infectious diseases affecting the G-I tract. Conditions like typhoid fever and hepatitis A are still common, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation. In a study published in the Indian Journal of Gastroenterology, it was reported that approximately thirty five percent of patients presenting with acute gastrointestinal symptoms were diagnosed with a waterborne infection. Effective preventative measures, including improved sanitation and widespread vaccination programs, are crucial in mitigating the impact of these infections.

{"unnormalised": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a significant concern, mirroring global trends. The increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in India is driving the rise of NAFLD, potentially leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Early detection through routine liver function tests (LFTs) and lifestyle modifications are essential for managing this condition. A recent conference in Mumbai emphasized the importance of dietary changes and regular exercise in preventing the progression of NAFLD. Furthermore, the diagnosis often involves an ultrasound or, in some cases, a liver biopsy costing approximately Rs. 8000 at private labs.", "normalised": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (N-A-F-L-D) is emerging as a significant concern, mirroring global trends.

{"unnormalised": "Access to advanced endoscopic procedures remains limited in many parts of the country. While major cities like Chennai and Kolkata have well-equipped gastroenterology units, rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure and trained personnel. This disparity in access to care contributes to delayed diagnoses and poorer outcomes for patients with conditions like esophageal cancer and colon cancer. Telemedicine and mobile health clinics can play a crucial role in bridging this gap and providing remote consultation and monitoring services.", "normalised": "Access to advanced endoscopic procedures remains limited in many parts of the country.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, gastroenterology in India presents a complex landscape characterized by a high burden of infectious diseases, emerging metabolic disorders, and disparities in access to care. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach encompassing improved sanitation, widespread vaccination, increased awareness, enhanced diagnostic capabilities, and equitable access to specialized medical services. Ongoing research and collaboration between healthcare professionals, policymakers, and community stakeholders are essential to improving the gastrointestinal health of the Indian population. The next national gastroenterology conference is slated for 12/12/2024 in Bangalore.", "normalised": "In conclusion, gastroenterology in India presents a complex landscape characterized by a high burden of infectious diseases, emerging metabolic disorders, and disparities in access to care.
