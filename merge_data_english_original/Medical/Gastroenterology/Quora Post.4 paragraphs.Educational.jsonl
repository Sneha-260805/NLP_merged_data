{"unnormalised": "Well, India, like any other country, sees its fair share of gastroenterological issues. Some of the more prevalent ones include infections like typhoid, which is often diagnosed with a Widal test. Treatment usually involves antibiotics like ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 7 days, but always consult a Dr. first. Diarrhea is common too, especially during the monsoon. Dehydration is a big concern, so ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) is a must.", "normalised": "Well, India, like any other country, sees its fair share of gastroenterological issues.

{"unnormalised": "Another common problem is acidity or heartburn, which many attribute to spicy food. Antacids like Ranitidine 150mg can provide temporary relief, but persistent issues need investigation, possibly including an endoscopy at a good hospital like AIIMS. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is also seen. Symptoms vary but can include abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Diet changes and stress management are key, sometimes along with medications like loperamide HCL 2mg for diarrhea-predominant IBS.", "normalised": "Another common problem is acidity or heartburn, which many attribute to spicy food.

The cost of this procedure at a private hospital can range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1,00,000.", "normalised": "Liver diseases, including hepatitis A, B, and C, are also significant.
