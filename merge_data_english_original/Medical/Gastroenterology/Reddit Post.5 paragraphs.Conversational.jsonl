I'm talking constant bloating, crazy gas, and just this general feeling of yuck. I initially thought it was something I ate, maybe too much spicy food during Diwali celebrations on 12/11/2023, but it's not going away.

{"unnormalised": "My family doc, Dr. Verma, suggested I see a gastroenterologist. He suspects maybe IBS or even something like Crohn's. Honestly, just hearing those words made me wanna hide under the covers. He recommended 2 docs: Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, Delhi and Dr. Patel at Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon. Anyone have any experiences with either of them? Or suggestions for others?

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, I'm terrified of the procedures. Colonoscopy, endoscopy… the thought makes my skin crawl! I've been reading up on stuff online, and it all sounds so…invasive. My friend, Priya, said she had a colonoscopy and it wasn't *that* bad, but still… Any tips for prepping for one? Or, like, how to stay calm during the whole thing? Also, any idea how much these procedures cost typically in Delhi hospitals? I’m hearing figures around ₹15000-₹25000, is that right?", "normalised": "The thing is, I'm terrified of the procedures.

{"unnormalised": "I’m also trying to change my diet. Cutting out the usual culprit - spicy food. Sticking to bland stuff like khichdi and yogurt. My dadi keeps saying it's \"pitta dosha\" and to drink lots of buttermilk. I'm also trying to avoid gluten, as someone online mentioned that could help. Has anyone else had success with dietary changes managing similar issues? Also, I’ve started taking some probiotics (brand name redacted - don't wanna seem like I'm advertising!), 1 capsule after dinner.", "normalised": "I’m also trying to change my diet.
