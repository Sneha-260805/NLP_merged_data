{"unnormalised": "One of the most common things is definitely acidity. You see ads for Eno and Digene all the time, right? Blame it on our spicy food and irregular eating habits. So many ppl I know pop antacids like candy. My uncle, Mr. Sharma, is a prime example; he’s always got a bottle of some antacid handy. Says his acidity flares up if he even *thinks* about eating a samosa after 8 PM.", "normalised": "One of the most common things is definitely acidity.

{"unnormalised": "Next up, infections. With so many street food vendors (love them!), there's always a risk of catching something. Think typhoid, hepatitis A, or even just a bad case of food poisoning. That’s why you need to be careful where you eat. My friend Priya caught giardiasis after a trip to Rishikesh. It took her like, 3 wks to recover fully, and she lost 5 kgs. Nasty stuff!", "normalised": "Next up, infections.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It’s a tricky one because the symptoms can be different for everyone. Some people get constipated, others get diarrhea, and some get both. It's thought that stress plays a big role, and let's face it, life in India can be pretty stressful, no? There's no real cure for it, just managing the symptoms with diet and lifestyle changes. Heard many ppl in Bangalore suffer from this due to the IT job stress.", "normalised": "Then there's Irritable Bowel Syndrome (I-B-S).

{"unnormalised": "Lactose intolerance is also super common. A lot of Indians have trouble digesting milk and dairy products. I think it's something like 60-70% of the population has some degree of lactose intolerance, according to some articles I've read.

There's lactose-free milk available now, though, so that's helpful.", "normalised": "Lactose intolerance is also super common. A lot of Indians have trouble digesting milk and dairy products.

{"unnormalised": "Another important area is liver-related problems. Things like fatty liver disease and hepatitis B & C are quite prevalent. Fatty liver is often linked to obesity and diabetes, which are unfortunately on the rise. Hepatitis B and C can be serious and lead to long-term liver damage.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, don't forget about piles (haemorrhoids). Embarrassing to talk about, but very common, especially with our diets and sedentary lifestyles. Often due to straining during bowel movements. My grandfather had them, and I remember him constantly using some cream or the other. It's something that a lot of people deal with, especially as they get older. It can be treated with creams, medications, or even surgery in severe cases. Rs 100 spent on a better diet can save u a lot in the future.", "normalised": "Lastly, don't forget about piles (haemorrhoids).
