I’m still avoiding Maa’s aloo parathas (she's not happy!), but I’m also grateful to have caught this early. Ignoring the symptoms was foolish. So, lesson learned: listen to your body, and don't delay seeing a specialist, especially if your stomach is acting up. It could be something as simple as H. pylori, but best to get it checked. Now, if you’ll excuse me, it's almost 8 PM, time for my medication.", "normalised": "It’s been a month now. The pain is mostly gone. The bloating is significantly reduced.
