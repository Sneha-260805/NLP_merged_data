{"unnormalised": "First off, what is Gastroenterology? Basically, it's the branch of medicine that deals with your digestive system: esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. When these guys aren’t happy, neither are you. Think heartburn, bloating, constipation, diarrhea – the whole shebang. My symptoms started subtly; just occasional indigestion. I popped some Eno, thought nothing of it. Big mistake!", "normalised": "First off, what is Gastroenterology?

{"unnormalised": "Eventually, the indigestion became a daily struggle. I'd get this gnawing pain in my stomach, especially after eating spicy food. I’m a Delhiite – spicy food is LIFE! But my poor gut was screaming at me. I tried all sorts of home remedies: ajwain, ginger tea, even that weird concoction my grandma makes with hing. Nothing seemed to provide lasting relief. I even tried cutting out my beloved samosas, can you imagine?!", "normalised": "Eventually, the indigestion became a daily struggle.

{"unnormalised": "That’s when I finally wised up and decided to see a doctor. My family physician, Dr. Sharma, recommended a gastroenterologist. She suggested Dr. Kapoor at Max Hospital, Saket. Apparently, he's quite good. Getting an appointment took almost 3 weeks! But hey, good doctors are in demand, right? In the meantime, she prescribed Pantoprazole 40mg to ease the discomfort. It helped somewhat, but I still felt like something was off.", "normalised": "That’s when I finally wised up and decided to see a doctor.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the day arrived! Dr. Kapoor was a really nice guy. He asked a ton of questions about my diet, lifestyle, and family history. He even asked about stress levels, which, let's be real, are always through the roof in this city! He suspected it could be anything from acid reflux to something more serious like an ulcer. He ordered a bunch of tests: a blood test, a stool test, and, the dreaded, endoscopy. The endoscopy cost me ₹6500 at the hospital.", "normalised": "Finally, the day arrived!

{"unnormalised": "The endoscopy wasn’t as bad as I’d imagined, honestly. But the results… well, they showed I had H. pylori, a bacteria that can cause ulcers. Dr. Kapoor prescribed a course of antibiotics – a triple therapy involving Amoxicillin 1000mg, Clarithromycin 500mg & Pantoprazole for 14 days. He also emphasized the importance of diet and lifestyle changes. More importantly, he told me to chill!

{"unnormalised": "So, after a month of meds and mindful eating (yes, even fewer samosas!), I started feeling much better. My experience taught me a valuable lesson: don't ignore your gut! If something feels off, see a doctor. And remember, while home remedies can help, they're no substitute for professional medical advice. Now if you’ll excuse me, I'm off to find a mildly spiced dish!
