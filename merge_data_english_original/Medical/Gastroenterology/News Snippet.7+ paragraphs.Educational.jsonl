{"unnormalised": "The research points towards lifestyle factors such as increased stress levels, dietary changes & sedentary habits as potential contributors. Processed foods, commonly known as junk food, lack of physical exercise & irregular sleep patterns are prevalent amongst this age group, as noted by Dr. Iyer. The study shows that approximately 35% of the surveyed population reported experiencing symptoms consistent with IBS, incl. abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habits.", "normalised": "The research points towards lifestyle factors such as increased stress levels, dietary changes and sedentary habits as potential contributors.

Early results suggest that individuals with IBS exhibit a distinct gut bacteria profile compared to healthy controls. Probiotic supplements, containing strains like Lactobacillus & Bifidobacterium, are being explored as potential therapeutic interventions.
