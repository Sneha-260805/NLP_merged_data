{"unnormalised": "One major concern is infectious diseases, primarily due to sanitation challenges in some areas. This leads to a high prevalence of conditions like typhoid (caused by Salmonella typhi) and Hepatitis A. You might see it reported as “Hep A” sometimes. Consuming contaminated food and water is a major risk factor. Symptoms can range from mild nausea to severe liver damage. Prevention through vaccination and improved hygiene is key. Cases often peak during the monsoon season from Jul to Sep.", "normalised": "One major concern is infectious diseases, primarily due to sanitation challenges in some areas.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. While historically less common in India compared to the West, their incidence is rising, especially in urban areas. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Diagnosis often involves colonoscopy and biopsies. Treatment often requires medications like steroids and immunomodulators. Patients frequently seek second opinions from specialists at hospitals like CMC Vellore. You might see ulcerative colitis abbreviated as UC in some medical records.", "normalised": "Then there are inflammatory bowel diseases (I-B-D) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

{"unnormalised": "Lifestyle factors also play a significant role. Conditions like acid reflux (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are becoming increasingly prevalent, often linked to dietary habits and stress. Many Indians experience these symptoms and often self-medicate with antacids, costing around Rs. 50 for a strip of 10 tablets. But it's crucial to consult a gastroenterologist for proper diagnosis and management, especially if symptoms persist for more than 2 weeks.", "normalised": "Lifestyle factors also play a significant role.
