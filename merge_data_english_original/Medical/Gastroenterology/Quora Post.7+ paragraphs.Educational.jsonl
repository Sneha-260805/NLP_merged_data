{"unnormalised": "One of the most common issues is infectious diarrhea. This is often caused by contaminated food or water and leads to symptoms like frequent watery stools, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever. It's frequently seen after consuming street food, especially during the monsoon. Treatment typically involves oral rehydration solutions (ORS) to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. In severe cases, antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin 500mg might be prescribed by a Dr. However, indiscriminate use of antibiotics is discouraged due to the risk of antibiotic resistance.", "normalised": "One of the most common issues is infectious diarrhea.

It's frequently seen after consuming street food, especially during the monsoon. Treatment typically involves oral rehydration solutions (O-R-S) to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. In severe cases, antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin five hundred milligram might be prescribed by a Dr. However, indiscriminate use of antibiotics is discouraged due to the risk of antibiotic resistance."}
{"unnormalised": "Another major concern is acidity and GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Spicy foods, irregular eating habits, and stress contribute significantly to this. Symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, and a sour taste in the mouth. Many people self-medicate with antacids like Digene or Gelusil. However, prolonged and severe cases warrant a visit to a gastroenterologist. Treatment often involves lifestyle modifications (avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals) and medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as Omeprazole 20mg or Pantoprazole 40mg, prescribed once daily.", "normalised": "Another major concern is acidity and G-E-R-D (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).

{"unnormalised": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is also a fairly widespread issue. Its characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation, or both). Diagnosis is often made after ruling out other conditions, and treatment is highly individualized. There is no single cure. Management often involves dietary changes (like following a low-FODMAP diet), stress management techniques (yoga, meditation), and medications to manage specific symptoms (e.g., anti-diarrheals like Loperamide 2mg). Finding a good gastroenterologist, perhaps at AIIMS Delhi or CMC Vellore, is recommended for comprehensive management.", "normalised": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (I-B-S) is also a fairly widespread issue.

{"unnormalised": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a significant risk factor for peptic ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum). This bacterial infection is often asymptomatic but can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis is usually done through a breath test or endoscopy. Treatment involves a combination of antibiotics (typically Clarithromycin 500mg, Amoxicillin 1gm, and a PPI) in a regimen known as triple therapy, lasting for 14 days. Eradication of H. pylori is essential to prevent ulcer recurrence and reduce the risk of stomach cancer.", "normalised": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a significant risk factor for peptic ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum).

{"unnormalised": "Gallstones are another common gastroenterological problem. These are hard deposits that form in the gallbladder, often causing severe abdominal pain, especially after fatty meals. Smaller stones might pass on their own but larger stones often require surgical removal via a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Many hospitals across India, like Max Healthcare and Apollo Hospitals, offer this procedure. Pre-operative assessments may involve an ultrasound for ₹2500 or a CT scan.", "normalised": "Gallstones are another common gastroenterological problem.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, liver diseases, including hepatitis (A, B, C, and E) and cirrhosis, are a major public health concern in India. Hepatitis A and E are usually transmitted through contaminated food and water, while Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and bodily fluids. Vaccination is available for Hepatitis A and B. Treatment for chronic Hepatitis B and C involves antiviral medications. Cirrhosis, scarring of the liver, can be caused by chronic hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or other conditions. Management of cirrhosis includes treating the underlying cause, managing complications (like ascites – fluid accumulation in the abdomen), and potentially liver transplantation in severe cases. Patients are often advised to avoid alcohol completely and maintain a healthy diet. Regular checkups with a specialist are critical; often they occur on the 1st and 15th of each month for some patients.", "normalised": "Finally, liver diseases, including hepatitis (A, B, C, and E) and cirrhosis, are a major public health concern in India.
