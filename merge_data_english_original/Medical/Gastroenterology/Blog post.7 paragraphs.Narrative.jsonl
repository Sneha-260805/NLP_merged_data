A little bloating after meals, a mild discomfort here and there. I thought it was just the chaat I had from that street vendor near my office in Gurgaon; probably a bit too much spice. Ignored it for a while, popping a Gelusil here and there. Bad move."}

Found Doctor Sharma online, rated pretty highly, said he specialised in, well, everything gut-related. His clinic was located in Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj. The appointment was for eleven A M on eighteenth August two thousand and twenty four. Prep involved fasting from the night before, which, let me tell you, was an ordeal in itself, especially when the aroma of Priya's butter chicken was wafting through the house."}

Along with a strict diet plan, of course – absolutely no spicy food, fried items, or caffeine. My beloved chai was banished!"}
