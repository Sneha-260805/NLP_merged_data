But understanding common issues like acidity, gas, and even more serious conditions can empower you to take charge of your health. Ever felt that burning sensation after enjoying some delicious biryani? That's likely acidity kicking in. Many folks in India experience this, often reaching for an antacid like Gelusil or Digene. But repeatedly popping pills isn't the best long-term solution, right? Lifestyle changes are key!", "normalised": "Gastroenterology, or as I like to call it, the \"tummy track,\" can seem daunting.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent issues we see at hospitals like AIIMS are cases of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). People complain of bloating, cramping and changes in bowel habits. Diagnosis often involves ruling out other conditions, sometimes including a colonoscopy. Dietary adjustments, such as reducing gluten or lactose intake, can often provide relief. Probiotics are also sometimes prescribed. Remember to consult a qualified gastroenterologist before making significant dietary changes, especially if you are already on medications for other conditions like diabetes or hypertension.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent issues we see at hospitals like A-I-I-M-S are cases of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (I-B-S).

Early detection through blood tests like the HBsAg and anti-HCV is crucial. Treatment options have improved dramatically over the past decade, with antiviral medications offering a good chance of controlling the virus and preventing liver damage. Vaccination against Hepatitis B is highly recommended, especially for children. The Indian Liver Society provides valuable resources and support for patients and families affected by liver diseases.", "normalised": "Moving beyond everyday discomfort, conditions like Hepatitis B and C are unfortunately still quite common in certain parts of India.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing we frequently see is gallstone issues. Often, the initial symptom is just vague discomfort after eating oily food. But if left untreated, gallstones can lead to serious complications like cholecystitis. A simple ultrasound can usually diagnose gallstones. In many cases, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (keyhole surgery) is the preferred treatment option, allowing for a faster recovery. Many hospitals like Apollo in Chennai perform this procedure regularly.", "normalised": "Another thing we frequently see is gallstone issues.
