{"unnormalised": "The treatment of liver diseases, including hepatitis B and C, has also improved substantially. Newer antiviral medications offer higher cure rates with fewer side effects. Furthermore, liver transplantation techniques have become more refined, with several hospitals, incl. Apollo Hospitals, performing living donor liver transplants with increasing success rates. As of 2023, success rates for liver transplants in India have increased by approx. 10% in the last 5 years.", "normalised": "The treatment of liver diseases, including hepatitis B and C, has also improved substantially.

{"unnormalised": "The increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has led to a greater focus on early detection and lifestyle interventions. Diagnostic methods like FibroScan are becoming more widely available to assess liver fibrosis non-invasively. Lifestyle changes, incl. diet and exercise, remain the cornerstone of NAFLD management. Many healthcare professionals suggest that limiting sugar intake to less than 25 grams a day can help lower the risk of NAFLD.", "normalised": "The increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (N-A-F-L-D) has led to a greater focus on early detection and lifestyle interventions.
