{"unnormalised": "I've been experiencing persistent abdominal pain and discomfort for a few weeks now. Could this be something serious, or just a temporary issue? What are the common gastroenterological conditions I should be aware of in the Indian context, and what are the typical diagnostic procedures involved?", "normalised": "Well, persistent abdominal pain and discomfort warrant medical attention. It's difficult to diagnose without a proper examination. Several gastroenterological conditions are prevalent in India, ranging from common to more serious issues. Some of the frequently encountered conditions include acid reflux, often exacerbated by dietary habits, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (I-B-S), which affects a significant portion of the population. Infectious diseases such as typhoid and hepatitis, still relevant in certain regions of India, also present with gastrointestinal symptoms."}

These are often linked to H. pylori infection or the prolonged use of N-S-A-I-Ds like Ibuprofen four hundred milligram for pain relief. Gallstones are another common problem, particularly in women, leading to pain after consuming fatty meals. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (I-B-D), comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasingly recognized in India, although less prevalent than some other conditions."}

A thorough physical examination is always the first step. Following this, blood tests, including a complete blood count (C-B-C) and liver function tests (L-F-T-s), are often conducted.

An ultrasound of the abdomen can detect gallstones or abnormalities in the liver. An upper endoscopy, where a thin tube with a camera is inserted into the esophagus and stomach, is used to visualize the lining and take biopsies if needed. Similarly, a colonoscopy is used to examine the colon. These procedures are often performed at hospitals like A-I-I-M-S or Fortis."}

These can provide detailed images of the abdominal organs and help identify structural abnormalities. If H. pylori infection is suspected, a breath test or a stool antigen test might be performed. Always consult with a qualified gastroenterologist like Doctor Rajesh Kumar from Apollo Hospital, Delhi, for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Don't self-diagnose or self-medicate. Early detection and appropriate management are key to preventing complications."}
