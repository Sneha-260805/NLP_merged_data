A lot of doctors, like Dr. Sharma at AIIMS, are seeing more and more patients with GERD these days. Then there's IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which can be a real pain – bloating, constipation, sometimes even needing to rush to the loo after just 1 bite of chilli chicken. There are medications available, like Spasmindon forte.

{"unnormalised": "Colonoscopies are also increasingly common. My uncle had one done at Apollo Hospitals last year and he was dreading it but said it was surprisingly easy (after the prep, that is!). Docs recommend you get one after 50 yrs of age generally. It's basically a way to screen for anything nasty, like colon cancer, early on. It's a little expensive, costing upwards of Rs. 10,000 in some places, but definitely worth considering, especially if you have a family history.", "normalised": "Colonoscopies are also increasingly common.
