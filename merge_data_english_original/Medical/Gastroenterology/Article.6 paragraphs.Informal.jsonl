{"unnormalised": "Speaking of doctors, gastroenterologists use all sorts of cool gadgets and procedures to get to the bottom of your tummy troubles. Colonoscopies, endoscopies (where they stick a camera down your throat, fun!), biopsies... the works. They might even order blood tests or stool samples to check for infections or inflammation. Don’t be shy about asking them what they’re doing and why. Understanding the process can make it a whole lot less scary.

{"unnormalised": "Treatments vary wildly, depending on what's causing the problem. For mild cases, like acid reflux, simple lifestyle changes like avoiding spicy foods, eating smaller meals, and maybe losing a few kgs can do the trick. For more serious conditions, you might need medication, like antacids for heartburn or antibiotics for infections. In some cases, surgery might even be necessary. Remember, prevention is always better than cure. Cutting down on oily foods, drinking 2 liters of water daily and eating on time is a good way to start.", "normalised": "Treatments vary wildly, depending on what's causing the problem.
