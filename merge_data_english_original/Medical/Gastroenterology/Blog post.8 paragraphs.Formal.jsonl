{"unnormalised": "One frequently encountered condition is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Many individuals experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Diagnosis often involves ruling out other organic diseases, and treatment focuses on symptom management through dietary modifications, stress reduction techniques, and medications like antispasmodics. A consultation with Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS, New Delhi could provide a personalized management plan.", "normalised": "One frequently encountered condition is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (I-B-S).

{"unnormalised": "Another prevalent concern is acid peptic disease (APD), which includes conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The heavy reliance on spicy and oily foods in many Indian diets contributes to this problem. Treatment usually involves proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as Omeprazole 20mg or Pantoprazole 40mg, H2 receptor antagonists, and lifestyle modifications. Endoscopic procedures are sometimes required to diagnose and manage complications.", "normalised": "Another prevalent concern is acid peptic disease (A-P-D), which includes conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (G-E-R-D).

{"unnormalised": "Liver diseases, including hepatitis (A, B, C, and E), cirrhosis, and liver cancer, pose a substantial health challenge. The consumption of contaminated water and food contributes to the spread of hepatitis A and E. Chronic hepatitis B and C, often transmitted through unsafe medical practices or blood transfusions before screening protocols were implemented, can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Timely diagnosis and antiviral therapy, such as Tenofovir 300mg, are crucial.", "normalised": "Liver diseases, including hepatitis (A, B, C, and E), cirrhosis, and liver cancer, pose a substantial health challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasingly recognized in India. The exact cause is unknown, but it involves an abnormal immune response to the gut microbiota. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Treatment often involves immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and biologic therapies. Diagnosis frequently necessitates colonoscopy with biopsies.", "normalised": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (I-B-D), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasingly recognized in India.
