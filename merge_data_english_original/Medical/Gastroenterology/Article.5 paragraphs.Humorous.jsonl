One minute it's constipation, the next it's diarrhea, and all the while, your stomach's belting out dramatic dialogues. Diagnosing IBS can be tricky; often, Dr. Sharma at AIIMS will suggest cutting out gluten or lactose, which basically means no more naan or chai!

Usually caused by H. pylori or excessive use of painkillers, they're a painful reminder that even the strongest stomachs have their limits. Treatment often involves antibiotics and PPIs (proton pump inhibitors), which, let’s be honest, sound like something out of a sci-fi film. Remember that Rs. 5000 endoscopy the doc recommended?

Remember, if your gut's acting up, don't just Google your symptoms and self-diagnose with some obscure disease you found on WebMD. Consult a proper gastroenterologist like Dr. Patel.
