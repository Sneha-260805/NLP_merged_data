{"unnormalised": "A lot of folks get confused about when they should actually see a gastroenterologist. Is it just for severe pain? What about bloating? The general rule of thumb is if you have persistent discomfort lasting for >2 weeks, or notice significant changes in your bowel habits (more frequent trips to the loo, or the opposite!), get it checked out. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS Delhi, for instance, is a renowned expert in the field, with 20+ years of experience.

It’s when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing that burning sensation. Lifestyle changes, like avoiding spicy foods and eating smaller meals, can often help. Some patients even benefit from sleeping with their head elevated by 6 inches! However, if these don’t work, medications like PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors) are often prescribed.", "normalised": "One common complaint we see is G-E-R-D (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).

It allows doctors to visualize the lining of your digestive tract and identify problems like ulcers or polyps.
