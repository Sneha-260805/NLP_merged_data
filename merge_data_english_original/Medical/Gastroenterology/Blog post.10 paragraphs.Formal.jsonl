{"unnormalised": "Liver diseases also fall under the purview of gastroenterology. Cirrhosis, hepatitis (A, B, and C), and fatty liver disease are among the common liver conditions managed by GI specialists. Advanced liver diseases can lead to significant complications, including portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnostic tools, such as liver biopsy and imaging studies like ultrasound and CT scans, are crucial in evaluating liver function and detecting abnormalities. Management strategies often involve antiviral therapies, lifestyle changes (e.g., abstinence from alcohol), and, in severe cases, liver transplantation. A consultation with Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS, New Delhi, for liver-related ailments, is often recommended by primary care physicians.", "normalised": "liver diseases also fall under the purview of gastroenterology. cirrhosis, hepatitis (A, B, and C), and fatty liver disease are among the common liver conditions managed by G-I specialists. advanced liver diseases can lead to significant complications, including portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. diagnostic tools, such as liver biopsy and imaging studies like ultrasound and C-T scans, are crucial in evaluating liver function and detecting abnormalities. management strategies often involve antiviral therapies, lifestyle changes (for example, abstinence from alcohol), and, in severe cases, liver transplantation. a consultation with doctor rajesh kumar at A-I-I-M-S, new delhi, for liver-related ailments, is often recommended by primary care physicians."}
{"unnormalised": "Peptic ulcer disease, characterized by sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum, is another prevalent gastrointestinal condition. The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterium is a major culprit in the development of peptic ulcers. Diagnosis typically involves endoscopy or a urea breath test to detect the presence of H. pylori. Treatment usually consists of eradicating the bacteria with a course of antibiotics, along with medications to reduce stomach acid production, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It's important to complete the full course of medications prescribed by the GI specialist for effective ulcer healing.", "normalised": "peptic ulcer disease, characterized by sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum, is another prevalent gastrointestinal condition. the helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterium is a major culprit in the development of peptic ulcers. diagnosis typically involves endoscopy or a urea breath test to detect the presence of H. pylori. treatment usually consists of eradicating the bacteria with a course of antibiotics, along with medications to reduce stomach acid production, such as proton pump inhibitors (P-P-Is). it's important to complete the full course of medications prescribed by the G-I specialist for effective ulcer healing."}
{"unnormalised": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are characterized by symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits without any detectable structural abnormalities in the digestive system. Diagnosis is often based on symptom criteria, such as the Rome IV criteria. Management strategies typically involve a combination of dietary modifications, stress management techniques, and medications to alleviate specific symptoms like diarrhea or constipation. A recent study highlighted the efficacy of low-FODMAP diets in managing IBS symptoms among Indian patients.", "normalised": "functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (I-B-S), are characterized by symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits without any detectable structural abnormalities in the digestive system. diagnosis is often based on symptom criteria, such as the rome four criteria. management strategies typically involve a combination of dietary modifications, stress management techniques, and medications to alleviate specific symptoms like diarrhea or constipation. a recent study highlighted the efficacy of low-F-O-D-M-A-P diets in managing I-B-S symptoms among indian patients."}
{"unnormalised": "Gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and pancreatic cancer, are a significant concern in gastroenterology. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. Screening methods like colonoscopy are recommended for individuals at increased risk of colorectal cancer, starting at age 45 or earlier if there is a family history of the disease. Treatment strategies may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these modalities. Regular follow-up appointments with a gastroenterologist are essential for monitoring disease progression and managing side effects of treatment.", "normalised": "gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and pancreatic cancer, are a significant concern in gastroenterology. early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. screening methods like colonoscopy are recommended for individuals at increased risk of colorectal cancer, starting at age forty five or earlier if there is a family history of the disease. treatment strategies may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these modalities. regular follow-up appointments with a gastroenterologist are essential for monitoring disease progression and managing side effects of treatment."}
