{"unnormalised": "Namaste everyone! Today, let's talk about something quite common, especially with our varied Indian diets – acid reflux. It's that burning sensation you sometimes feel after a spicy biryani or a rich ghee-laden dish, but what exactly is it? Simply put, acid reflux happens when stomach acid flows back up into your esophagus. This can cause discomfort and, if it happens frequently, can lead to more serious problems.", "normalised": "Namaste everyone!

{"unnormalised": "One of the most common symptoms is heartburn, that burning feeling in your chest after eating. Other symptoms can include a sour taste in your mouth, regurgitation of food, bloating, nausea, and even a chronic cough or sore throat. Many people mistake it for a heart attack sometimes, but it's important to know the difference. Consult Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS if you're worried.", "normalised": "One of the most common symptoms is heartburn, that burning feeling in your chest after eating.

{"unnormalised": "What causes this backflow of acid? Well, there's a valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) that normally prevents stomach acid from coming up. When the LES weakens or relaxes inappropriately, acid can escape. Certain foods, such as fried snacks or too much chai, can trigger this. Smoking and being overweight can also contribute.", "normalised": "What causes this backflow of acid?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about diagnosis. If you're experiencing frequent symptoms, it's important to consult a gastroenterologist. They might recommend an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is used to examine your esophagus and stomach. A pH monitoring test, which measures the amount of acid in your esophagus, is another option. You can typically get an endoscopy done for Rs. 3500-Rs. 5000 at a good private hospital.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about diagnosis.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can you do to manage acid reflux? Lifestyle changes are often the first line of defense. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of three large ones. Avoid eating late at night (at least 2-3 hrs before sleeping). Elevate the head of your bed by about 6-8 inches to help keep acid down. Certain foods are common triggers, e.g. anything too oily.", "normalised": "So, what can you do to manage acid reflux? Lifestyle changes are often the first line of defense.

{"unnormalised": "Medications can also help. Over-the-counter antacids like Gelusil can provide temporary relief. H2 blockers, such as Ranitidine 150mg twice daily, reduce acid production. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Omeprazole 20mg once daily are more potent and work by blocking acid production in the stomach. Remember, always consult a doctor before taking any medication!", "normalised": "Medications can also help. Over-the-counter antacids like Gelusil can provide temporary relief.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, if lifestyle changes and medications aren't enough, surgery might be an option. Fundoplication, a procedure where the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus to strengthen the LES, is sometimes recommended. Though this is rare. Acid reflux is a manageable condition, and with the right approach, you can live a comfortable and healthy life.
