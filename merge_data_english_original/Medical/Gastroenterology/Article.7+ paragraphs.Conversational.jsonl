Gastroenterologists are like the traffic controllers, ensuring everything flows smoothly. They diagnose and treat conditions affecting organs like the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. It's a lot more than just indigestion!", "normalised": "Think of your gut as a complex highway system. Food enters, gets processed, nutrients are absorbed, and waste exits.

{"unnormalised": "One common issue they deal with is GERD, or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. You might know it as acidity or heartburn. It’s that burning sensation that creeps up your chest after a heavy meal. Many people experience this occasionally, especially after indulging in rich, oily foods. However, if it’s happening more than twice a week, consistently, it's time to see a gastroenterologist. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS Delhi is a specialist in GERD and related conditions. She often recommends lifestyle changes first, like avoiding late-night meals and elevating the head of your bed. Medications like Omeprazole 20mg can also help manage the symptoms.", "normalised": "One common issue they deal with is G-E-R-D, or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

{"unnormalised": "Another frequently encountered condition is IBS, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. IBS is trickier because it’s a functional disorder. This means that even though your gut looks perfectly normal, it doesn’t function properly. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. Diagnosing IBS often involves ruling out other conditions like infections or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a more serious condition involving inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. Symptoms of IBD can include severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, weight loss, and fatigue.", "normalised": "Another frequently encountered condition is I-B-S, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

{"unnormalised": "Colonoscopies are a key diagnostic tool in gastroenterology. It might sound scary, but it's a vital procedure for detecting polyps and other abnormalities in the colon. Usually, a colonoscopy is recommended every 10 yrs after the age of 45, earlier if there's a family history of colon cancer. Prep involves drinking a special liquid to clean out your colon, and the procedure itself is usually performed under sedation.", "normalised": "Colonoscopies are a key diagnostic tool in gastroenterology.

{"unnormalised": "Liver diseases are also a significant area of focus for gastroenterologists. Conditions like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and cirrhosis can severely impact liver function. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent long-term complications. A simple blood test can often detect elevated liver enzymes, indicating a potential problem. Treatment options range from lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise to medications and, in severe cases, liver transplantation.", "normalised": "Liver diseases are also a significant area of focus for gastroenterologists.
