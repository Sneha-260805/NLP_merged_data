{"unnormalised": "Gastroenterology, often shortened to \"GI,\" is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system, and it's far more vital than many realise. Your GI tract – stretching from your mouth to, well, the other end – is responsible for extracting the nutrients your body needs to function.

{"unnormalised": "One prevalent issue is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. Symptoms range from abdominal pain and bloating to altered bowel habits. Diagnosing IBS is often a process of elimination, ruling out other conditions first. Managing IBS typically involves dietary changes, stress reduction techniques, and medications to alleviate specific symptoms. Many find relief through a low-FODMAP diet, guided by a registered dietician. I usually advise my patients in my clinic to keep a food diary.", "normalised": "One prevalent issue is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or I-B-S.

{"unnormalised": "Another frequently encountered condition is acid reflux, medically known as GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). It occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing heartburn and regurgitation. Lifestyle modifications, like avoiding trigger foods (spicy food, caffeine), elevating the head of the bed, and not eating 2-3 hrs before bed, often help. Medications like antacids, H2 blockers (e.g., Ranitidine 150mg), and PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors, e.g., Omeprazole 20mg) are commonly prescribed.", "normalised": "Another frequently encountered condition is acid reflux, medically known as G-E-R-D (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).

{"unnormalised": "Moving further down the GI tract, we encounter conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. These are chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the digestive tract. Symptoms can include persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. Diagnosis often involves colonoscopy with biopsy. Treatment aims to control inflammation with medications like corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics.", "normalised": "Moving further down the G-I tract, we encounter conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (I-B-D), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

{"unnormalised": "Liver diseases also fall under the purview of gastroenterology. Conditions like Hepatitis A, B, and C, cirrhosis, and fatty liver disease can significantly impact liver function. Hepatitis A is often contracted through contaminated food or water, while Hepatitis B and C are typically transmitted through blood or bodily fluids. Vaccination is available for Hepatitis A and B. Managing liver disease often involves lifestyle changes (avoiding alcohol), medications, and in severe cases, liver transplantation.", "normalised": "Liver diseases also fall under the purview of gastroenterology.
