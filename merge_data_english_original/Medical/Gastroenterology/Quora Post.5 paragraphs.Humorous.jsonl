Plus, how much ghee did your mom (or you, no judgement!) throw in there? Ghee is delicious, no doubt, but too much can make your stomach feel like a bloated rickshaw stuck in traffic. It's the Mumbai monsoon of your gut, basically.", "normalised": "Firstly, you got to consider what kind of dal. Moong dal is usually chill, but that urad dal? Hoo boy, buckle up.

Think of it like upgrading from a scooter to a Royal Enfield – takes longer to digest, but handles the road better. Also, chawal ke saath papad? Spicy pickles? Adding fuel to the fire, my friend!", "normalised": "Then there's the rice. White rice can be a sneaky culprit. Brown rice might be your new best friend.

If it persists, though, maybe see a proper gastroenterologist. Could be more serious than just too much dal-chawal. They might suggest tests, and you don't want to ignore a persistent issue. Good luck and may your stomach be ever in your favour!", "normalised": "Finally, walk around a bit after eating.
