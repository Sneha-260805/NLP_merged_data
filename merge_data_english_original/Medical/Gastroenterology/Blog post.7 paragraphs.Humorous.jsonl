Just a little \"Delhi belly,\" I thought, after that street food adventure (rupees twenty for the best golgappas ever!). But then came the bloating. Oh, the bloating! I looked like I'd swallowed a whole football team. My doc, Doctor Khan (M-B-B-S, M-D, A-I-I-M-S), bless his soul, said it was likely I-B-S, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome for those of us who aren't fluent in medical jargon. He suggested cutting out gluten. Gluten?! That’s like asking an Indian to give up chai!"}
