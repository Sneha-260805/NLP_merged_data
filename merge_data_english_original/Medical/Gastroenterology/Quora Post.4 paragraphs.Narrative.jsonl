Initially, I self-medicated with antacids – ENO, Gelusil, the works! – thinking it was just acidity. But the pain persisted. It was a burning sensation, especially after eating spicy food (which, let’s be honest, is pretty much every meal in our house!). I even tried some home remedies my nani told me about – ginger and ajwain. Nothing seemed to give me lasting relief.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about managing gastritis, right?

So, my advice? Don't ignore persistent stomach pain. See a gastroenterologist, get the proper diagnosis, and follow their treatment plan. Self-treating might provide temporary relief, but you could be masking a bigger problem. Good luck!", "normalised": "It took a few weeks, but I started feeling much better.
