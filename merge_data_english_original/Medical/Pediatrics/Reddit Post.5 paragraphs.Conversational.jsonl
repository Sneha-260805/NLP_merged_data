We’ve consulted Dr. Meena at Rainbow Children’s Hospital, and she initially suspected a viral infection.

Is this something to be concerned about? He eats reasonably well, though he is a fussy eater sometimes, like most toddlers, right? I've also heard about other paediatricians like Dr. Reddy at Manipal Hospital, but switching feels overwhelming.", "normalised": "Doctor Meena also mentioned that Arjun's weight is slightly below the average for his age – he’s only twelve kilogram.
