She'd chuckle, remembering the chaotic OPDs filled with anxious parents and their equally restless kids. \"Imagine,\" she’d say, \"trying to explain the importance of ORS solution for a child suffering from dehydration due to diarrhoea in the middle of peak Delhi summer. Temperature hitting 45°C, no AC, and a queue stretching out the door! \" The sheer volume of cases was overwhelming, but she always maintained that each child deserved individual attention.", "normalised": "Doctor Sharma, my mother, often reminisced about her early days in paediatrics at A-I-I-M-S, Delhi.

It was around 10/08/1998, a particularly bad monsoon season, when a family from Bihar arrived with their 6-month-old baby, diagnosed with severe pneumonia. The infant's oxygen saturation was dangerously low, around 70%. Resources were stretched thin. The ICU was full and a ventilator wasn’t immediately available. Dr. Sharma and her team worked tirelessly, manually ventilating the baby for hours, till a bed finally opened up.", "normalised": "One particular incident always stuck with her.

{"unnormalised": "She told me about the unique challenges of communicating with parents, often from diverse backgrounds, who were grappling with complex medical information. Explaining a diagnosis like bronchiolitis, the need for nebulization with 2.5mg of albuterol, or the intricacies of vaccination schedules to someone who hadn’t had access to formal education required immense patience and empathy. She had to simplify complicated medical terminology and rely on visual aids and analogies to ensure they understood.", "normalised": "She told me about the unique challenges of communicating with parents, often from diverse backgrounds, who were grappling with complex medical information.

It wasn't just about treating illnesses; it was about connecting with families, understanding their struggles, and offering hope amidst the chaos. She instilled in me the importance of compassionate care, a lesson far more valuable than any medical textbook. Her time in paediatrics, especially in those early days, shaped her into not just a doctor, but a healer.", "normalised": "Years later, watching her dedicate her life to children's health, I understood her stories.
