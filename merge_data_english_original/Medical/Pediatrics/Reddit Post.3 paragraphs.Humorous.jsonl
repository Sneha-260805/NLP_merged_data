My little Arjun is 6 months old and seems to have suddenly developed the appetite of a sumo wrestler.

Also, he's started teething, so it's all about the drool and fussiness. Send coffee (and maybe a manual for decoding baby cries?).", "normalised": "Hey everyone, newbie parent here, totally sleep-deprived and wondering if this is normal!

{"unnormalised": "And speaking of crying, anyone else dealing with the dreaded \"witching hour\"? From 6 PM to 9 PM, it's like Arjun transforms into a tiny, screaming banshee. We've tried everything: rocking, singing, white noise, even letting him watch Bollywood songs on YouTube (don't judge!). The only thing that seems to work sometimes is a ride in the auto-rickshaw around our area. I swear, the vibrations must be magic. Pediatrician recommended Gripe Water, but Mom says “gharelu nuskhe” are better.
