{"unnormalised": "Finding a good pediatrician in Mumbai felt like searching for a needle in a haystack, tbh. Everyone had different opinions, and the sheer number of options was overwhelming. Finally, after asking around in my mommy group, I settled on Dr. Meena Sharma at Lilavati Hospital. She's supposed to be really good with newborns, and her clinic is close to my place in Bandra.", "normalised": "Finding a good pediatrician in Mumbai felt like searching for a needle in a haystack, to be honest.

{"unnormalised": "One thing I quickly learned is that Indian pediatricians often have different approaches than what you read online. For example, my grandmother kept insisting I give Aarav \"ghutti\" (herbal concoction) for his digestion. Dr. Sharma gently but firmly advised against it, saying it's not recommended by modern medicine and can even be harmful. Phew!", "normalised": "One thing I quickly learned is that Indian pediatricians often have different approaches than what you read online.

{"unnormalised": "Navigating vaccinations was another challenge. The schedule is a bit different here, with BCG, DPT, OPV, and Hep B all crammed into the first few months. Plus, there are optional vaccines like Rotavirus and PCV which can be expensive. Dr. Sharma helped me prioritize based on Aarav's individual needs and my budget. Costs around Rs. 2500 each!", "normalised": "Navigating vaccinations was another challenge.

{"unnormalised": "I also found that Indian pediatricians are more likely to prescribe antibiotics than their counterparts in the West. When Aarav had a bad cough and cold at 3 months, Dr. Sharma prescribed Amoxicillin for 5 days.

{"unnormalised": "Another tip I picked up: don't be afraid to prepone appointments! When Aarav developed a fever of 102°F on a Sunday, I called Dr. Sharma's clinic and they squeezed me in for an emergency appointment. It's so important to have a pediatrician who's accessible when you need them most. Plus, get ready to wait in line! The waiting room at Lilavati is always packed with anxious parents and crying babies. Arrive at least 30 mins early!", "normalised": "Another tip I picked up: don't be afraid to prepone appointments!

{"unnormalised": "Overall, my experience with pediatric care in India has been positive. It's a different system, but with a little research and a good pediatrician, you can ensure your little one gets the best possible care. Remember, every baby is different, and what works for one might not work for another. Trust your instincts, ask questions, and don't be afraid to seek a second opinion if needed. And most importantly, enjoy this precious time with your little one!", "normalised": "Overall, my experience with pediatric care in India has been positive.
