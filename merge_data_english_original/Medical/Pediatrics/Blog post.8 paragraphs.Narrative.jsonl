Last week, my six month old, Aisha, spiked a fever. My heart leaped into my throat. All those \"what if\" scenarios started playing out in my head. Was it just a common cold, or something more serious? Doctor Sharma, our pediatrician at Cloudnine Hospital, had always said that the first fever is the scariest. And she was right."}

Aisha was a bit fussier than usual, wanting to be held constantly. Then, at around seven P-M, I felt her forehead. It was warm, definitely warmer than it should be. The thermometer read one hundred point four degree Fahrenheit. Panic started to set in. I remembered Doctor Sharma's advice to keep an eye on the temperature and give her Paracetamol one hundred and twenty five milligram if it crossed one hundred degree Fahrenheit."}

She's seen it all, having raised three kids in Delhi. She reminded me of all the times I had fevers as a child and how she used to treat me with home remedies and a doctor's visit, if needed. Her calm voice helped me collect myself."}

It was a challenge getting her to swallow it, but after some coaxing and a funny face, she finally took it. I sponged her down with lukewarm water, focusing on her forehead and armpits. I kept checking her temperature every hour."}

Aisha slept fitfully, and I barely closed my eyes. I kept thinking about all the possible causes, from a simple viral infection to something more serious. The internet, of course, was no help, just a rabbit hole of scary diagnoses."}

It was still there, around ninety nine point five degree Fahrenheit, but she was more alert and even managed a small smile. We had a scheduled follow up appointment with Doctor Sharma on sixteenth May two thousand and twenty four. Doctor Sharma confirmed it was just a mild viral infection. She prescribed some electrolyte solution and advised us to continue monitoring her."}

And always, always have a good pediatrician on speed dial! Dealing with Aisha's first fever was scary, but now I'm a little more prepared for the next one. Hope that I won't get to use my knowledge soon."}
