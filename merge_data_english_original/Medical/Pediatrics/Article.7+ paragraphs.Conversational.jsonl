{"unnormalised": "First off, pediatrics isn't just one thing. It’s a broad field covering everything from newborns to adolescents, typically up to 18 yrs old. A pediatrician is like your kiddo’s all-rounder doctor. They handle regular check-ups, vaccinations, and treat illnesses, both big and small. Think of Dr. Sharma at Rainbow Children's Hospital – she’s been our family pediatrician for years! She always knows just what to do, whether it’s a common cold or something a little more complicated.", "normalised": "First off, pediatrics isn't just one thing.

{"unnormalised": "Now, why is pediatrics so crucial? Well, children aren't just small adults. Their bodies are still developing, and they have different needs than grown-ups. A pediatric specialist understands these differences. They know how to diagnose diseases in kids, what dosages of medicines like Amoxicillin 250mg are appropriate, and how to support their growth and development. Early diagnosis is key. Catching something early can make a world of difference. My friend’s son was diagnosed with asthma at 3 yrs old, and with the right treatment plan from his pediatrician at AIIMS Delhi, he’s been thriving.", "normalised": "Now, why is pediatrics so crucial?

{"unnormalised": "In India, we also face specific challenges. Malnutrition is a big one, particularly in rural areas. Ensuring children get the right nutrition is a massive part of pediatric care. Vaccinations are another critical area. While we’ve made huge strides with initiatives like the Pulse Polio program, ensuring every child gets their recommended shots, like the BCG and MMR vaccines, is an ongoing effort. There is also the issue of childhood infections. Conditions like diarrhea and pneumonia are unfortunately common, particularly in underprivileged communities. Access to timely and quality pediatric care can drastically reduce mortality rates. A recent UNICEF report highlighted that nearly 1.2 million children under 5 die each year in India, many from preventable causes.", "normalised": "In India, we also face specific challenges.
