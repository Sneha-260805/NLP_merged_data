But lately, my little Rohan has taken things to a whole new level. He's decided he's Dr. Rohan now, apparently. He's even got his stethoscope – a repurposed toilet paper roll – and spends his days diagnosing our poor cat, Mittens, with \"too much fur.\"", "normalised": "So, life with a toddler.

She's been subjected to multiple \"check-ups\" involving Rohan poking her with a plastic spoon and declaring her \"all better\" with a generous pat that borders on assault.
