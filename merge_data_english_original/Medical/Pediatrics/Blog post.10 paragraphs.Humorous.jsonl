{"unnormalised": "So, you’ve got a tiny human. Congratulations! Get ready for a wild ride filled with questionable smells, sleep deprivation, and the constant, nagging fear that you're doing everything wrong. Don’t worry, you probably are, but that’s okay! Pediatrics is here to help, or at least confuse you with medical jargon.", "normalised": "So, you’ve got a tiny human. Congratulations!

{"unnormalised": "First things first: Vaccinations. Think of them as tiny superhero injections. Your little one needs a bunch, starting with the BCG vaccine right after birth. Doc Sharma at Rainbow Hospital says it’s like giving them a little shield against the world's villains. Except the villains are diseases, and the shield is made of science. And the injection might make them cry. A lot. Plan accordingly. Schedule the next appointment for Pentavac at 6 wks with doc!", "normalised": "First things first: Vaccinations.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the dreaded \"milestone\" charts. They’re basically a roadmap of parental inadequacy. \"Your child *should* be saying 'mama' by 12 months.\" Great. Mine's just perfected the art of projectile vomiting. I’d say that's a milestone of sorts. My niece started walking by 11 months but I can bet that she can't finish 2 bowls of Dal.", "normalised": "Then there's the dreaded \"milestone\" charts.

{"unnormalised": "Fevers! Oh, the fevers. A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) is basically the end of the world, according to every parenting forum ever. Panicking is mandatory. Alternating Calpol (paracetamol) and Nurofen (ibuprofen) every 3 hours becomes your new hobby. Don’t forget the wet cloths on the forehead! It’s an age-old remedy, even if it seems to make them angrier. Remember that Dr. Sen prescribes antibiotics for most common fevers.", "normalised": "Fevers! Oh, the fevers.

{"unnormalised": "Diaper rash. This is where things get…messy. Think of it as Mount Everest, but on a much smaller, smellier scale. Barrier creams are your Sherpas. Apply liberally. And for the love of all that is holy, change the diaper frequently! Especially after they do a #2 after consuming a lot of veggies or sweets.", "normalised": "Diaper rash.

{"unnormalised": "Feeding schedules? A complete joke. Your baby operates on a schedule dictated by hunger and pure, unadulterated chaos. Forget the cute little charts.

{"unnormalised": "Growth spurts! Suddenly, your tiny human is ravenous and demanding. They’ll want to eat every 2 hours and cling to you like a tiny, needy koala. Just go with it.

{"unnormalised": "And finally, remember that you are not alone. Every parent feels like they’re failing spectacularly at least once a day.

{"unnormalised": "So, congratulations again! You’ve officially entered the wonderful, wacky world of pediatrics. Buckle up, it’s going to be a bumpy (and potentially vomit-covered) ride. Remember Dr. A. Kumar and his words: \"Trust yourself. You know your baby best...usually.\" And always consult your pediatrician for real medical advice. This blog post is just for comedic relief (and maybe a little bit of sanity). Don't forget to pre-pone the next appointment by a wk if you see something unusual.", "normalised": "So, congratulations again! You’ve officially entered the wonderful, wacky world of pediatrics.
