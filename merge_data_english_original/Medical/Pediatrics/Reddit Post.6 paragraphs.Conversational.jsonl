{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice re: my kiddo's health. My lil' Arjun, he's 3 yrs old, has been having these weird skin rashes for like, a week now. We thought it was just the Delhi heat at first, but it's not going away, and he’s also been running a fever – usually around 101°F. It's mainly on his tummy and back, kinda bumpy and red. He’s also super cranky, which, tbh, is unusual for him, he’s generally a happy chap.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice regarding my kiddo's health.

{"unnormalised": "We went to our family Dr., Dr. Sharma at Max Hospital, and she mentioned it could be chickenpox, even though he got his Varicella vaccine last yr. She prescribed Calamine lotion & some Paracetamol 250mg for the fever. Said to keep him hydrated with ORS and sponging him down with cool water. We've been doing all that, but honestly, I'm a bit worried. The rash seems to be spreading.", "normalised": "We went to our family Doctor, Doctor Sharma at Max Hospital, and she mentioned it could be chickenpox, even though he got his Varicella vaccine last year.

{"unnormalised": "Also, he's started refusing food. He used to love his dal chawal, now he’s barely touching anything. It’s been almost 48 hrs since he ate properly. I’m really concerned about dehydration. I tried giving him some glucose water, but he just spits it out. Has anyone else experienced something similar with their toddlers? What did you do? Any home remedies that worked?", "normalised": "Also, he's started refusing food. He used to love his dal chawal, now he’s barely touching anything.

{"unnormalised": "I'm thinking of maybe getting a second opinion. Perhaps another pediatrician? I've heard good things about Dr. Patel at AIIMS, but getting an appointment there is next to impossible! I’m also wondering if it could be something else entirely – maybe measles?

{"unnormalised": "Anyone have any experience with skin allergies in kids? We did introduce him to mangoes for the 1st time this season just before the rashes appeared, so maybe that's a connection? Could it be a reaction to the mangoes or something else new we tried? I'm just grasping at straws here. Any thoughts would be super appreciated!", "normalised": "Anyone have any experience with skin allergies in kids?
