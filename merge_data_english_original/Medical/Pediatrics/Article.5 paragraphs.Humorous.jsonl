{"unnormalised": "So, you think you’ve seen it all? Try spending a week observing pediatric cases in India. Forget your adult patients complaining about a slight headache; we’re talking about tiny humans wielding the power of tantrums and the uncanny ability to detect even the smallest needle within a 5-km radius. Dr. Sharma always says, \"Handling adults is like solving a Sudoku; handling kids is like managing a Bollywood wedding with surprise guests and a power outage.\" And trust me, she’s not wrong.", "normalised": "So, you think you've seen it all?

{"unnormalised": "One classic case? The dreaded fever. Suddenly, a simple temperature reading of 101°F becomes a national emergency. The wailing commences, reaching decibel levels usually reserved for fighter jets taking off. You attempt to administer the 2.5ml of Calpol, and suddenly you're in a wrestling match with a pint-sized, surprisingly strong opponent. More medicine ends up on your white coat than in the child’s mouth, leaving you looking like you just lost a battle with a strawberry milkshake.", "normalised": "One classic case? The dreaded fever. Suddenly, a simple temperature reading of one hundred and one degree Fahrenheit becomes a national emergency.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are the dietary demands. Forget about a balanced diet. We're dealing with future food critics who’ll declare anything green as the enemy. A simple request to eat some spinach (palak) elicits a theatrical performance worthy of an Oscar, complete with crocodile tears and dramatic refusals. Forget convincing them about the iron content; bribing with a cartoon sticker usually has a higher success rate. Maybe we should prescribe cartoon therapy, thrice a day, after meals.", "normalised": "Then there are the dietary demands. Forget about a balanced diet.

{"unnormalised": "And let’s not forget the curious case of the missing vaccinations. Mention “injection,” and you've instantly activated their internal alarm system. A routine MMR vaccine becomes an exercise in agility and diplomacy. The kid, armed with ninja-like reflexes, will hide behind their mother, under the examination table, even inside the doctor's coat (true story!). You might even end up offering a lifetime supply of Dairy Milk chocolates just to get a quick jab in.", "normalised": "And let's not forget the curious case of the missing vaccinations.

{"unnormalised": "In the end, though, despite the drama, the wails, and the constant negotiation with tiny tyrants, seeing that mischievous grin return after they finally conquer their 101°F fever, or when they stop resisting that vital vaccine, makes it all worthwhile. Pediatric medicine, truly, is a circus act, but with infinitely more adorable clowns. And let’s be honest, who wouldn’t prefer a tiny, sticky-fingered hug to a grumpy adult complaining about back pain? Just don’t ask me to handle the spinach wars again.", "normalised": "In the end, though, despite the drama, the wails, and the constant negotiation with tiny tyrants, seeing that mischievous grin return after they finally conquer their one hundred and one degree Fahrenheit fever, or when they stop resisting that vital vaccine, makes it all worthwhile.
