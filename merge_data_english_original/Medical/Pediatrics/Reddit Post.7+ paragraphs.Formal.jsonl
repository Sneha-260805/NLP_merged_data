{"unnormalised": "One major area of concern remains infant mortality rates. While there has been a steady decline, the numbers are still alarming, particularly in underdeveloped regions. Factors contributing to this include malnutrition, inadequate sanitation, and limited access to quality medical facilities. Govt. initiatives like the National Health Mission are making a difference, but more needs to be done to ensure that every child, regardless of their socio-economic background, receives the necessary medical attention. The recent surge in respiratory infections among children in Delhi during the winter months highlighted the urgent need for improved air quality and preventative measures. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS Delhi recommends increased awareness campaigns on hygiene and early intervention.", "normalised": "One major area of concern remains infant mortality rates.

Some parents are influenced by misinformation and are reluctant to vaccinate their children. This is a serious issue, and we need to address it through education and awareness campaigns. We also need to ensure that vaccines are readily available and accessible to all, especially in remote areas. The availability of the MMR vaccine at primary health centers is often inconsistent, leading to preventable outbreaks.", "normalised": "Vaccination programs have been instrumental in eradicating diseases like polio.

{"unnormalised": "Another area that needs attention is the management of childhood obesity. With changing lifestyles and dietary habits, more and more children are becoming overweight or obese. This increases their risk of developing chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease later in life. We need to promote healthy eating habits and encourage physical activity among children. Schools and parents play a crucial role in this. According to a recent study published in The Lancet, 25% of children in urban India are either overweight or obese.", "normalised": "Another area that needs attention is the management of childhood obesity.

{"unnormalised": "In recent years, there have been significant advancements in pediatric medicine. For example, we now have better diagnostic tools and treatment options for childhood cancers. Gene therapy and stem cell transplantation are showing promising results. The use of technology, such as telemedicine, is also improving access to healthcare for children in remote areas. For instance, a child with a rare genetic disorder in Guwahati can now consult with specialists in Chennai via video conferencing. The cost of these advanced treatments, however, remains a significant barrier for many families. An oncology treatment can easily cost ₹10 lakh or more.", "normalised": "In recent years, there have been significant advancements in pediatric medicine.

Providing children with a stimulating and nurturing environment is essential for their long-term health and well-being. This includes access to quality preschool education and healthcare. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme plays a vital role in this regard, providing nutrition and education to young children.
