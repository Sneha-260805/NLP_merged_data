She's seen my little Rohan through everything from chickenpox to a mysterious rash that turned out to be nothing more than a mild allergic reaction. Finding a pediatrician you trust is half the battle won. I initially met with 3 different peds before I made my choice.", "normalised": "Firstly, don't underestimate the power of a good pediatrician.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of chickenpox, vaccinations are KEY! I know there's a lot of debate surrounding them, but honestly, the peace of mind is worth it. Rohan got his MMR vaccine at 15 months, as per the schedule Dr. Sharma recommended. And guess what? No measles, mumps, or rubella. Phew! It also saves you a trip to the emergency room at 2 AM with a screaming, feverish child.", "normalised": "Speaking of chickenpox, vaccinations are K-E-Y!
