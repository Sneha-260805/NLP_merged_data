{"unnormalised": "Imagine your little one, say, 6 months old Aisha, develops a fever. The Dr. might write \"Rx Paracetamol 125mg q6h prn\" on the prescription. What does that even mean? \"Rx\" is just shorthand for prescription. Paracetamol, you know, is the fever medicine. \"125mg\" is the dosage. \"q6h\" means every 6 hours, and \"prn\" means \"as needed\". So, basically, give Aisha 125mg of paracetamol every 6 hours only if she has a fever. Simple, once you know the code!", "normalised": "Imagine your little one, say, six months old Aisha, develops a fever.

Keep an eye out for breathing difficulties and consult a doctor immediately. Another common one is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). It’s usually mild and resolves in 7-10 days. But it's highly contagious so practice good hygiene.
