{"unnormalised": "So, you've decided to venture into the world of tiny humans and their associated ailments? Buckle up, because pediatric care in India is less a gentle stroll and more a rickshaw ride through a bustling market – chaotic, colourful, and occasionally terrifying. We're talking about everything from deciphering the cries of a 6-month-old who thinks the world is ending because you won't let them eat dirt, to explaining to a 7-year-old that, no, they can’t actually catch Pokemon by swallowing their toys. Consider yourself warned!", "normalised": "So, you've decided to venture into the world of tiny humans and their associated ailments?

{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. Your clinic, be it a shiny Apollo branch or a humble neighbourhood practice, will inevitably become a battleground for germs. Forget personal space; expect to be sneezed on, coughed at, and occasionally used as a human climbing frame. The waiting room will be a symphony of shrieks, sniffles, and the rhythmic thump of tiny feet drumming on plastic chairs. And don't even get me started on the parents. You'll meet \"Dr. Google\" experts who diagnosed their child with a rare form of Martian flu after a 5-minute search, and the helicopter parents who hover so close they practically need their own oxygen masks.", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the art of diagnosis. A fever of 102°F (that’s approx. 38.9°C, for you non-Fahrenheit folks) could be anything from a simple viral infection to…well, another simple viral infection. But try telling that to the frantic mother who's convinced her child is on the verge of spontaneously combusting. And good luck getting a straight answer about symptoms. Is the child vomiting? “Thoda thoda,” which translates to “a little,” but could mean anything from a single spit-up to a full-blown projectile situation. The medical world is not always precise when you are talking to parents who are worried sick.", "normalised": "Then there's the art of diagnosis.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's discuss the medications. You'll spend half your day calculating dosages, explaining the difference between a teaspoon (tsp) and a tablespoon (tbsp), and praying that the child actually swallows the medicine instead of spitting it back in your face like a tiny, syrup-covered gargoyle. Antibiotics are practically currency, and parents will often demand them even if their child has a perfectly healthy sniffle. It’s a dance: a delicate balance between responsible prescription and avoiding a social media meltdown accusing you of medical negligence.", "normalised": "Now, let's discuss the medications.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the sheer joy of vaccinations. Imagine wrestling a tiny octopus while simultaneously trying to inject it with a needle. That's basically what giving a DPT shot to a toddler feels like. The screams, the tears, the desperate attempts to crawl under the furniture – it's all part of the charm. But hey, at least you're preventing diseases like polio, which is always a good thing. (Plus, if you administer all required vaccines before the age of 5, the kid practically has superpowers, or so I tell parents).", "normalised": "And let's not forget the sheer joy of vaccinations.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the chaos, the germs, and the occasional existential crisis, being a pediatrician in India is, surprisingly, rewarding. There's a certain satisfaction in watching a sick child bounce back to health, in reassuring worried parents, and in knowing that you're making a difference in the lives of these tiny tornadoes. Just remember to pack your sense of humour, your hand sanitizer, and a really, really good stethoscope. Also, if you can get it, a prescription for some good ol' chai and a pack of Marie biscuits. You’ve earned it.", "normalised": "Despite the chaos, the germs, and the occasional existential crisis, being a pediatrician in India is, surprisingly, rewarding.
