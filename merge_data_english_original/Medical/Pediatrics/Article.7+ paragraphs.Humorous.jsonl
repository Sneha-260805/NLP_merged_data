Welcome to the wild, wonderful world of pediatrics, where the patients are pint-sized, the diagnoses are often a guessing game, and the parents… well, let's just say they can be a handful.

You'll encounter the \"Dr. Google\" parents, armed with printouts from questionable websites and convinced their child has a rare genetic disorder because they sneezed twice. You’ll get constant questions like “Is 20ml of cough syrup too much?”. You’ll deal with the \"Helicopter Parents,\" hovering anxiously over every vaccination, growth chart, and diaper change. And, of course, the \"Anti-Vaxxers,\" who believe vaccines cause autism (despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary – you might need to patiently explain this, for the nth time).
