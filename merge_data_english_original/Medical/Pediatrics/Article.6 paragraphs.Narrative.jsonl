{"unnormalised": "It was a sweltering May afternoon when Rohan, all of 3 yrs old, was rushed into my clinic. His mother, Priya, was frantic. \"Dr. Sharma,\" she cried, \"he's had a fever of 102°F since last night, and he's been vomiting. Plus, there’s this rash…\". As a pediatrician with 15 yrs of experience, I’ve seen countless variations of this scenario, but something about Rohan’s presentation felt… different.", "normalised": "It was a sweltering May afternoon when Rohan, all of three years old, was rushed into my clinic.

{"unnormalised": "On examination, Rohan was indeed febrile and dehydrated. The rash, a raised, bumpy affair, was concentrated around his chest and back. He was also irritable and refusing to eat anything. I immediately suspected something more than just a simple viral infection. We did a quick blood test - results would take 2 hrs. Priya, understandably, was very anxious. I suggested she give Rohan small sips of ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) while we waited.", "normalised": "On examination, Rohan was indeed febrile and dehydrated.

{"unnormalised": "The lab report confirmed my suspicions: Rohan’s platelet count was alarmingly low, and his liver enzymes were elevated. It pointed towards a probable case of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a serious complication of Dengue, especially dangerous in children. I explained to Priya the gravity of the situation. We needed to admit Rohan to the Pediatric ICU at Apollo Hospital immediately.", "normalised": "The lab report confirmed my suspicions: Rohan’s platelet count was alarmingly low, and his liver enzymes were elevated.

{"unnormalised": "The next few days were a blur of IV fluids, constant monitoring, and platelet transfusions. We started him on antibiotics and monitored his vitals every 2 hrs. Priya stayed by his side, barely eating or sleeping. Seeing a mother’s worry for her child is always heart-wrenching, a stark reminder of the vulnerability of childhood. The nurses were wonderful, explaining everything to Priya in simple terms and ensuring Rohan was as comfortable as possible.", "normalised": "The next few days were a blur of I-V fluids, constant monitoring, and platelet transfusions.

{"unnormalised": "Thankfully, Rohan responded well to the treatment. His fever gradually subsided, his platelet count started to rise, and he began to eat small amounts. By day 7, he was stable enough to be discharged. Priya was overjoyed, showering us with thanks and promises of ladoos for the entire staff. As they left, Rohan, clutching a small teddy bear, waved goodbye.", "normalised": "Thankfully, Rohan responded well to the treatment.

{"unnormalised": "This case served as a powerful reminder of the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in pediatric care, especially in a country like India where infectious diseases are prevalent. And of course, the resilience of children and the unwavering love of a mother are powerful forces, often the best medicine of all. The follow-up appointment is scheduled for 15/06/2024, and I’m expecting to see a healthy, energetic Rohan, ready to take on the world.", "normalised": "This case served as a powerful reminder of the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in pediatric care, especially in a country like India where infectious diseases are prevalent.
