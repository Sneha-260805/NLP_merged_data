{"unnormalised": "One of the first things Dr. Sharma advised was vaccinations. We’re following the Indian Academy of Pediatrics schedule, which meant Aisha received her BCG vaccine shortly after birth.

Honestly, I was a little nervous about the side effects, but Dr. Sharma reassured us that they're usually mild – maybe a slight fever and some fussiness.", "normalised": "One of the first things Doctor Sharma advised was vaccinations.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the feeding schedule. At first, I was super stressed about whether Aisha was getting enough breast milk. I was constantly googling things like \"is 8 feeds a day enough?\" and obsessing over her weight gain.

{"unnormalised": "Sleep, or rather the lack of it, is another big topic. Everyone told me that newborns sleep all the time, but Aisha seems to have missed that memo!
