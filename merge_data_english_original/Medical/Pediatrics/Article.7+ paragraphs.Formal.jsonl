{"unnormalised": "Pediatrics, the branch of medicine concerned with the physical, mental, and social health of children from infancy through adolescence, has seen significant advancements in India over the past few decades. However, numerous challenges persist, particularly concerning access to care, prevalence of childhood diseases, and the availability of specialized pediatric services in rural areas. A recent study published in the Indian Journal of Pediatrics highlights the disparities in infant mortality rates across different states, with states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh reporting significantly higher rates compared to Kerala and Tamil Nadu.", "normalised": "Pediatrics, the branch of medicine concerned with the physical, mental, and social health of children from infancy through adolescence, has seen significant advancements in India over the past few decades.

{"unnormalised": "One of the major concerns is the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases. While India has made substantial progress with programs like the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), ensuring complete vaccination coverage remains a hurdle. For instance, measles outbreaks still occur in some regions due to gaps in vaccination. The recommended vaccination schedule by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics includes BCG at birth, OPV and Pentavalent (DPT, Hib, HepB) at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks, and Measles Rubella (MR) vaccine at 9-12 months, and again at 16-24 months, followed by booster doses. Maintaining awareness and addressing vaccine hesitancy are crucial steps to improve child health outcomes. Polio eradication, a remarkable achievement, was only possible due to rigorous immunization drives and constant surveillance.", "normalised": "One of the major concerns is the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

{"unnormalised": "Malnutrition remains a significant contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. Data from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) reveals that a substantial percentage of children under 5 years are stunted, wasted, or underweight. Initiatives like the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) aim to address malnutrition through supplementary nutrition, health check-ups, and pre-school education. However, effective implementation and monitoring are essential to achieve meaningful reductions in malnutrition rates. Often, factors like poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and poor sanitation contribute to the problem, requiring a multi-sectoral approach.", "normalised": "Malnutrition remains a significant contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, pediatric healthcare faces challenges concerning specialist availability. There is a shortage of pediatricians, especially in rural and remote areas. AIIMS, PGI Chandigarh, and CMC Vellore are centers of excellence in pediatric care and research, but their reach is limited.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in children is also an emerging concern. Childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and asthma are becoming increasingly prevalent, largely due to lifestyle changes and environmental factors. Promoting healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and reducing exposure to air pollution are essential preventive measures. Pediatricians need to be equipped to identify and manage these conditions effectively. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve long-term health outcomes.", "normalised": "The rise of non-communicable diseases (N-C-D-s) in children is also an emerging concern.

{"unnormalised": "Access to specialized pediatric care, such as pediatric cardiology, neurology, and oncology, is another area that needs improvement. Many children with complex medical conditions require specialized care that is not readily available in all regions. Strengthening regional referral networks and establishing more specialized pediatric centers are crucial steps to ensure that all children have access to the care they need. Creating awareness among parents and primary care physicians about the availability of specialized services is also essential.", "normalised": "Access to specialized pediatric care, such as pediatric cardiology, neurology, and oncology, is another area that needs improvement.

Strengthening immunization programs, tackling malnutrition, increasing the availability of pediatric specialists, and addressing the rising burden of NCDs are critical priorities. Investment in research, training, and infrastructure, coupled with community engagement and awareness campaigns, will pave the way for healthier futures for Indian children. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of existing programs are vital to ensure their effectiveness and to adapt them to the evolving needs of the population.
