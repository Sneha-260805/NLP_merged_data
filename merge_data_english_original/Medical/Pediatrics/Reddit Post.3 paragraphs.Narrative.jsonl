{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, newbie parent here! My 6-month-old, Rohan, has been having these weird spells of crying inconsolably, especially around 2 AM. At first, I thought it was just colic, but it's been going on for 2 weeks now. We took him to Dr. Sharma at Rainbow Children's Hospital, and she suggested it might be related to teething or a minor infection. She prescribed Calpol syrup 2.5ml every 6 hrs SOS and advised us to keep a close watch on his temp.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, newbie parent here!

I've also been reading online forums where parents are suggesting gripe water or homeopathic remedies. Has anyone else experienced something similar with their little one? Any advice from experienced parents would be greatly appreciated!", "normalised": "Honestly, I'm a bit stressed!

{"unnormalised": "We're going back to Dr. Sharma next week for a follow-up. She wants to run some tests if the crying persists. She mentioned a possible UTI or something allergy-related. Also, she suggested we introduce solid foods after Rohan turns 6 months, but only 1 tbsp twice a day. Anyone have recommendations for first foods? This whole parenting thing is overwhelming but I just want my lil guy to be happy & healthy.", "normalised": "We're going back to Doctor Sharma next week for a follow-up.
