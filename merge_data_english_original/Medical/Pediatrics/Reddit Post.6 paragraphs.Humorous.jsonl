She explained the whole process - X-ray to confirm the location of the Re. 1 coin, potential waiting game to see if it \"passes\" naturally (pun intended, folks!), and the dreaded endoscopy if it got stuck somewhere important. Seriously, “endoscopy” sounds like a super villain’s name! She said, “It’s common, don’t stress too much.
