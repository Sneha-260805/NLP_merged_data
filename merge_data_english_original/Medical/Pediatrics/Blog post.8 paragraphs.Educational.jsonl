{"unnormalised": "What exactly is asthma? In simple terms, it's a condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Symptoms can vary from mild wheezing and coughing to severe breathing difficulties requiring hospitalization. Children may experience these symptoms intermittently or chronically. Consult your pediatrician if your child coughs incessantly, especially at night, or shows signs of wheezing. A diagnosis by a medical professional like Dr. Kapoor is critical.", "normalised": "What exactly is asthma?

{"unnormalised": "Several factors can trigger asthma symptoms in children. Common triggers include allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander. Respiratory infections, such as the common cold or flu, are also significant triggers. Irritants like cigarette smoke, air pollution, and strong odors can exacerbate asthma symptoms. Physical activity, especially in cold weather, can also induce asthma attacks in some children. Managing these triggers is a key element of asthma management.", "normalised": "Several factors can trigger asthma symptoms in children.

{"unnormalised": "Diagnosis often involves a physical examination, lung function tests (spirometry), and allergy testing. Spirometry measures how much air your child can exhale and how quickly. Allergy tests identify specific allergens that may be triggering the asthma. A chest X-ray may be ordered to rule out other conditions. The process usually takes approximately 2 hrs at a clinic.", "normalised": "Diagnosis often involves a physical examination, lung function tests (spirometry), and allergy testing.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment plans typically involve a combination of medications and lifestyle modifications. Inhalers are the mainstay of treatment. Bronchodilators, like Salbutamol inhalers, provide quick relief during an asthma attack by relaxing the airway muscles. Inhaled corticosteroids, such as Budesonide, reduce inflammation in the airways and are used as long-term controller medications. It is crucial to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully when using these inhalers. Many paediatricians in hospitals such as AIIMS recommend using a spacer device with the inhaler, especially for young children.", "normalised": "Treatment plans typically involve a combination of medications and lifestyle modifications.

These plans outline the steps to take during an asthma attack, including when to use rescue medications and when to seek emergency medical care. Work with your child's doctor to develop a personalized asthma action plan. Keep this plan easily accessible and share it with caregivers, teachers, and other responsible adults.
