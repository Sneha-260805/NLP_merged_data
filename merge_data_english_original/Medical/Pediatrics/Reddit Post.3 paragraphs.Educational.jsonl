A lot of folks panic when their child's temp hits 100.4°F (38°C), but remember, fever itself isn't always the enemy. It's the body's way of fighting infection. You should focus more on how your child is acting. Are they still playing and eating a little, or are they lethargic and refusing everything? That's a more important indicator.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I'm a pediatric resident and wanted to share some common misconceptions I see parents having about fevers in kids.

Cool sponging with tepid water (not ice-cold!) can help bring the fever down.
