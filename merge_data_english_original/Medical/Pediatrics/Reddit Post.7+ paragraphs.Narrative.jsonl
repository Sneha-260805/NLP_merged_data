{"unnormalised": "It started a couple of months ago. He was always a bit of a picky eater, but lately, it’s gotten worse. He barely touches his food, and he’s lost some weight. I took him to Dr. Sharma at Cloudnine Hospital last week. She ran some blood tests, and the results came back showing low iron levels. She suggested iron supplements, 5 ml daily of some syrup, and said we should consult a Pediatric gastroenterologist, which I've preponed now.", "normalised": "It started a couple of months ago.

{"unnormalised": "But the bigger concern is his behavior. He used to be such a happy, energetic kid. Now, he’s constantly tired and irritable. He throws these massive tantrums over the smallest things – like if his favourite toy isn’t exactly where he left it, or if I try to get him dressed in anything other than his blue Spiderman t-shirt.

He woke up screaming at 6:00 AM, refused to eat breakfast, and then had a full-blown meltdown in the middle of the supermarket because I wouldn’t buy him a giant chocolate bar.

It was about 35 deg C yesterday and he refused to wear anything more than his shorts in the market and then got a fever later on.", "normalised": "Yesterday was particularly bad.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sharma mentioned something about possible developmental issues, but she wasn’t specific. She also suggested we rule out anything neurological, so she scheduled an EEG for him on 20/07/2024.
