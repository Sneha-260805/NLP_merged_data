{"unnormalised": "Hey folks, ever wondered what goes on in the world of kids' medicine? Pediatrics, that's what it's called, is a whole different ballgame than treating adults. Think about it – little bodies, big changes happening all the time, and not always able to tell you what's wrong! It's kinda like being a detective, only the clues are sometimes hidden behind a cute, but tear-streaked, face.", "normalised": "Hey folks, ever wondered what goes on in the world of kids' medicine?

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest things pediatricians deal with, especially in places like India, is infectious diseases. We're talking about things like typhoid, which unfortunately is still prevalent. I remember Dr. Sharma at AIIMS telling me they see at least 10 cases per week during peak season! And then there's the regular stuff – colds, coughs, fevers... Basically, everything your kiddo is gonna catch at school. The good news? Most of these things are easily treatable, just keep an eye on that temp – anything above 100.4°F (38°C) and it's time to consult your local doc.", "normalised": "One of the biggest things pediatricians deal with, especially in places like India, is infectious diseases.

{"unnormalised": "Then you've got the preventative side of things. Vaccinations are HUGE in pediatrics. We're not just talking about the basic ones. Especially with the rise in measles cases, some doctors even recommend the MMR vaccine before the standard 12 months.

It's honestly one of the best things you can do as a parent.", "normalised": "Then you've got the preventative side of things. Vaccinations are huge in pediatrics.

If there are any delays, early intervention can make a massive difference.", "normalised": "And it's not just about physical health, mind you. Pediatricians also keep an eye on development.

Things like heart defects, genetic disorders, etc. Early diagnosis is key. Usually, these can be detected with specialized testing like an echocardiogram, which can run about Rs. 3500 at a good private hospital.

{"unnormalised": "So, pediatrics is more than just \"kids' medicine\". It's a whole field dedicated to ensuring the health and well-being of children from the moment they're born all the way through adolescence. It’s about prevention, treatment, and ensuring every child has the opportunity to thrive. Plus, let's be honest, dealing with kids is way more fun than dealing with grumpy adults.
