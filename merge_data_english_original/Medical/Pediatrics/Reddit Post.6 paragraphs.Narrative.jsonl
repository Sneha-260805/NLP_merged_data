But then this past month, it's been happening like clockwork. She gets a fever for 2 days, it goes away for a week, then bam! It's back. We've tried everything: paracetamol (125mg syrup, as per the doc), cool compresses, the whole shebang.", "normalised": "We initially thought it was just normal kid stuff, you know?

He suspects it might be PFAPA syndrome (Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis), but he says it's a diagnosis of exclusion.
