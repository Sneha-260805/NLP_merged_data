{"unnormalised": "Handling medical emergencies in India requires a unique approach considering the specific challenges and resources available. One key aspect is knowing the emergency contact numbers. Dial 102 for ambulance services and 100 for the police. In many cities, 108 is also a reliable number for ambulance access. Remember that response times can vary depending on the location and traffic conditions, especially in crowded urban areas like Mumbai or Delhi. Pre-planning and having a list of local hospitals with their contact details (e.g., Apollo Hospitals: 044-28293333, AIIMS Delhi: 011-26588500) can save valuable time.", "normalised": "Handling medical emergencies in India requires a unique approach considering the specific challenges and resources available. One key aspect is knowing the emergency contact numbers. Dial one hundred and two for ambulance services and one hundred for the police. In many cities, one hundred and eight is also a reliable number for ambulance access. Remember that response times can vary depending on the location and traffic conditions, especially in crowded urban areas like Mumbai or Delhi. Pre-planning and having a list of local hospitals with their contact details (e.g., Apollo Hospitals: zero double four - two eight two nine - double three double three, A-I-I-M-S Delhi: zero one one - two six five eight - eight five zero zero) can save valuable time."}
{"unnormalised": "First aid knowledge is crucial. Basic skills like CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and the Heimlich maneuver can be life-saving before professional help arrives. Consider attending a first aid workshop organized by the Indian Red Cross Society or a similar organization. Familiarize yourself with common medical conditions in India, such as heart attacks, strokes, and road traffic accident injuries (RTAs), and the initial steps to take for each. For instance, recognizing the symptoms of a stroke using the FAST acronym (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) is vital for quick intervention. Remember, time is critical; the earlier the treatment, the better the outcome.", "normalised": "First aid knowledge is crucial.

{"unnormalised": "When dealing with emergencies, clear communication is essential. If calling for an ambulance, provide accurate information about the patient's condition, location (including landmarks if possible), and any relevant medical history. Speak slowly and clearly, and try to remain calm even under pressure. If bystanders are present, delegate tasks such as directing the ambulance or gathering the patient's medications. In rural areas with limited connectivity, consider sending someone to physically guide the ambulance to the location. Remember to clearly communicate that the patient might have an allergy; note it down (eg. Penicillin ALLERGY) for the paramedics/ doctors.", "normalised": "When dealing with emergencies, clear communication is essential.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, be aware of the legal and ethical considerations. In India, Good Samaritan laws exist to protect individuals who provide assistance in good faith during emergencies. However, it's important to act within your capabilities and avoid actions that could potentially harm the patient. Do not administer any medications unless you are a qualified healthcare professional. Always respect the patient's wishes and, if possible, obtain consent before providing treatment. If the patient is unconscious, act in their best interest and seek professional medical assistance immediately.", "normalised": "Finally, be aware of the legal and ethical considerations.
