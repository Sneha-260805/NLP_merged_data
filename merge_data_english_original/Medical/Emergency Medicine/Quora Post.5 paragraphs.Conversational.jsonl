It's a good question, especially since things can be a bit different here compared to, say, the US or UK. First off, remember to stay calm!

Keep trying, and if possible, get someone to flag down a passing auto-rickshaw or cab to get to the nearest hospital. Knowing the closest hospital beforehand is super helpful. Maybe even save the number of a good 24/7 clinic in your phone. A lot of hospitals, like Apollo or Fortis, have emergency departments (EDs), but even smaller clinics can stabilize a patient till they reach a bigger facility.", "normalised": "In most cities, dial one hundred and eight for ambulance services.

{"unnormalised": "Once you get to the ED, expect a bit of chaos. Triage nurses will quickly assess the patient based on severity – something like, \"BP 90/60, GCS 13, RR 28\" might be scribbled on their chart. Then, depending on the case, docs will order tests – ECG, X-rays, blood work, maybe even a CT scan if it’s head trauma or something serious. Common meds like Adrenaline 1mg might be given right away in cardiac arrest cases. Cost can be a concern; a basic visit to the ED might cost Rs. 1500, and tests can quickly add up.", "normalised": "Once you get to the E-D, expect a bit of chaos.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, remember that India has a mix of public and private healthcare. While Govt. hospitals like AIIMS offer affordable care, they can also be overcrowded. Private hospitals usually offer quicker service, but are significantly more expensive. Having health insurance really makes a difference. And knowing basic first aid can save lives!
