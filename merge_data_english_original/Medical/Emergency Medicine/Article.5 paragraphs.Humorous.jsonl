{"unnormalised": "Let’s be honest, folks. Walking into an Emergency Room is like stepping into a real-life episode of your favorite medical drama, except instead of George Clooney, you get a flickering fluorescent light and the distinct aroma of disinfectant and existential dread. You clutch your possibly-broken limb, glance at the triage nurse who seems perpetually unimpressed, and settle in for what could be a shorter wait than the Delhi Metro in peak hours. Good luck, because that wait time is estimated at 4 hrs. I mean, honestly, who decided that \"emergency\" meant \"take a number and chill\"?", "normalised": "Let's be honest, folks.

{"unnormalised": "The triage nurse, bless their weary soul, has seen it all. From paper cuts elevated to near-death experiences to the guy who’s convinced he’s allergic to his in-laws (a diagnosis I personally endorse). You're suddenly acutely aware that your problem, a mere stabbing pain in your side, is probably less exciting than the lady who believes she swallowed a whole samosa in one gulp. You start contemplating if your pain is really THAT bad, maybe you just need some chai and a good Bollywood movie?

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the waiting game. A symphony of coughing, beeping machines, and whispered conversations. You start eavesdropping on other people’s ailments, wondering if their condition is more dire than yours. Is that a real cough or just a plea for attention? Is that a gurney being wheeled towards the X-Ray dept? You start playing medical detective, convinced you could diagnose everyone faster than Dr. House after 3 shots of whiskey. Turns out, you're just hungry. You then think about ordering food online, but decide against it because of the possible wait time as well as delivery charges of approx. Rs. 50, not including taxes.", "normalised": "Then comes the waiting game. A symphony of coughing, beeping machines, and whispered conversations.

The doctor, looking understandably sleep-deprived, gives you a once-over that would make a customs officer blush.

It's all a blur of medical jargon and thinly veiled exasperation until you are handed a prescription of Paracetamol 650mg.", "normalised": "And finally, after what feels like a geological era, you get called.
