We rushed her for a CT scan - reports came back confirming our fears. Meanwhile, we had another patient, an elderly gentleman, who was complaining of severe chest pain. His ECG showed ST elevation – classic signs of an MI. We gave him aspirin 300mg stat and prepped him for thrombolysis.", "normalised": "The first patient, a young woman, maybe twenty two years old, was in critical condition, G-C-S of eight.

That night taught me the true meaning of emergency medicine – being prepared for anything, staying calm under pressure, and making split-second decisions that could mean the difference between life and death. It’s a demanding field, but incredibly rewarding.", "normalised": "By the time the sun rose, we had managed to stabilize most of the patients, but the exhaustion was overwhelming.
