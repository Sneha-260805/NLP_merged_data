Let me tell you, it's less \"Grey's Anatomy\" and more \"chaos coordinated by caffeine.\" You'll see things you can't unsee, like the guy who thought he could deep-fry his samosas a little *too* enthusiastically, or the aunty who tripped over her own saree rushing to see a Bollywood star filming nearby. We had a case last week where someone came in complaining of a headache after watching too many episodes of Naagin.
