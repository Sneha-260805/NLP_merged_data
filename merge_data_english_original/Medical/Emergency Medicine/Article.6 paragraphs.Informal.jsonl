{"unnormalised": "Emergency medicine in India, especially in cities like Mumbai & Delhi, faces a unique set of challenges. Think about it: crowded roads, limited ambulances, and sometimes, people just not knowing what to do 1st. You've got everything from road accident cases to heart attacks, all needing immediate attention, often with very little time to spare. A lot of smaller hospitals sometimes struggle with resources, especially during peak hours – imagine waiting when every second counts!", "normalised": "Emergency medicine in India, especially in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, faces a unique set of challenges.

{"unnormalised": "One major issue is awareness. Many people aren't trained in basic 1st aid or CPR. So, someone collapsing in the street might get surrounded by concerned onlookers, but not necessarily get the immediate help they need. We need more initiatives like the 'Golden Hour' campaign which emphasizes the critical 60 minutes after an accident. Getting people educated is key.", "normalised": "One major issue is awareness.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the infrastructure. While major hospitals like AIIMS & Apollo have state-of-the-art emergency rooms, getting patients *to* those hospitals can be a nightmare. Ambulance response times are often longer than they should be, especially in congested areas. Plus, the cost of ambulances can be prohibitive for some families, leaving them scrambling for alternatives. For instance, an ambulance ride from Andheri to Breach Candy can cost upwards of Rs. 3000/-!", "normalised": "Then there's the infrastructure.

Telemedicine could be a game-changer, allowing paramedics in ambulances to connect with specialists at hospitals, getting real-time guidance and prepping the ER for what’s coming. Imagine a quick ECG reading sent ahead – that could save valuable minutes.
