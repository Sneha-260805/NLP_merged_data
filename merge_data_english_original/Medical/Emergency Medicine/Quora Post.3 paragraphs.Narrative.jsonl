The doctors said if we had delayed even by another 30 mins, the outcome could have been very different. My grandfather is now recovering well, thanks to the quick actions of everyone involved. That experience really showed me how critical and demanding emergency medicine is.", "normalised": "At Fortis, Doctor Sharma and the team were ready.
