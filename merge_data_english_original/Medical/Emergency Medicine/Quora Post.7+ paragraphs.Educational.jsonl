In metro cities like Mumbai or Delhi, you might find well-equipped ambulances with paramedics who can start treatment en route to a big hosp. like AIIMS or Apollo. In smaller towns or rural areas, resources might be more limited. 108, the emergency number, is supposed to be nationwide, but response times can vary from 15 mins in urban centers to >1 hour in remote areas.", "normalised": "First off, understand that access and quality can vary significantly.

{"unnormalised": "When you call 108, be ready to provide key info: your location (as precise as possible), the nature of the emergency (e.g., heart attack, accident, stroke), and the number of patients. The operator will ask questions to triage the situation and dispatch the appropriate resources. Some ambulances now have basic life support (BLS) capabilities, meaning they can provide oxygen, CPR, and administer certain meds. Advanced life support (ALS) ambulances have more advanced equipment and paramedics trained to do more complex procedures.", "normalised": "When you call one zero eight, be ready to provide key info: your location (as precise as possible), the nature of the emergency (e.g., heart attack, accident, stroke), and the number of patients.

{"unnormalised": "Upon arrival at the hospital ER, expect a rapid assessment by the triage nurse or doctor. They’ll check vital signs like BP, heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Depending on the severity, patients are categorized, often using a system like the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). ESI 1 is for critical patients who need immediate attention (e.g., cardiac arrest), while ESI 5 is for non-urgent cases (e.g., minor cuts). Be prepared for potential waiting times; patients with more urgent conditions will always be seen first.", "normalised": "Upon arrival at the hospital E-R, expect a rapid assessment by the triage nurse or doctor.

{"unnormalised": "Common emergencies include road traffic accidents (RTAs), heart attacks (myocardial infarctions or MIs), strokes (cerebrovascular accidents or CVAs), respiratory distress (e.g., asthma exacerbations), and trauma cases. Treatment protocols typically follow international guidelines, but can be adapted based on available resources. For example, if someone has a heart attack, doctors might administer aspirin 300mg and attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, either with medications (thrombolytics) or by sending the patient for an angioplasty. For stroke, time is of the essence; a CT scan is often done within 25 mins to determine if it's a bleed or a clot.", "normalised": "Common emergencies include road traffic accidents (R-T-A-s), heart attacks (myocardial infarctions or M-I-s), strokes (cerebrovascular accidents or C-V-A-s), respiratory distress (e.g., asthma exacerbations), and trauma cases.
