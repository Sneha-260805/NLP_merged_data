{"unnormalised": "First off, getting an ambulance. The 108 service is supposed to be nationwide, but response times can vary wildly. In a metro like Mumbai, you might get one in 15-20 mins, but in a smaller town or rural area, it could take much longer - maybe even an hr. This is a big deal when you're talking about emergencies like a heart attack or a severe accident. They really need more funding & better infrastructure.", "normalised": "First off, getting an ambulance. The one zero eight service is supposed to be nationwide, but response times can vary wildly.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the issue of pre-hospital care. Many ambulances don't have paramedics with advanced training. Often, it's just a driver and maybe a basic EMT.

{"unnormalised": "Now, about the hospitals. Major private hospitals like Apollo or Fortis usually have well-equipped emergency departments with trained doctors and nurses. They can handle most emergencies, from trauma cases to cardiac arrests. But the cost of treatment can be a significant barrier for many people.

{"unnormalised": "Govt. hospitals, on the other hand, are more accessible, but they are often overcrowded and understaffed. You might find a long wait time, even for serious conditions. The quality of care can be variable too. While the doctors are generally well-qualified (many are MDs or DNBs in emergency medicine), they are often stretched thin. The infrastructure, while improving, still lags behind private sector. Plus, documentation can be a nightmare!", "normalised": "Government hospitals, on the other hand, are more accessible, but they are often overcrowded and understaffed.

{"unnormalised": "One big problem is public awareness. Many people don't know basic first aid or CPR. This can make a huge difference in outcomes. Imagine someone collapsing with a cardiac arrest, and bystanders can't start chest compressions – that’s a wasted opportunity. There needs to be more public education campaigns on how to respond to emergencies. Something like, “if someone collapses check for breathing and start compressions at a rate of 100-120 per min.”", "normalised": "One big problem is public awareness.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, there's the traffic! Getting to the hospital in a traffic-choked city like Bangalore or Delhi can be a real challenge. Even with sirens blaring, an ambulance can get stuck in a jam. Some cities are trying to create \"green corridors\" for ambulances, but it's still a work in progress. I heard of a case where a patient lost his life because he couldn't reach the hosp in time thanks to traffic and road closure for VIP movement.", "normalised": "Finally, there is the traffic!

Better ambulance services, improved training for paramedics, more affordable healthcare, greater public awareness, and solving the traffic problem – all these are crucial for improving outcomes.
