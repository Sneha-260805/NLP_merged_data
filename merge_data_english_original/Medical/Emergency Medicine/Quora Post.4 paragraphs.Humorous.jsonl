It's not like what you see on TV, unless your TV shows feature a LOT of waiting and the constant beeping of monitors.

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, a \"minor\" complaint can actually be pretty serious. Like, Auntie Gita might think her chest pain is just gas from last night's biryani, but it could be something else entirely. We have to triage everyone based on how quickly they might turn into a bigger problem. Plus, you get some real characters. One time, a guy showed up convinced he'd swallowed his car keys. Turns out, he'd just misplaced them… after a *very* long night. Another insisted he was allergic to hospital air and needed fresh chai, stat.", "normalised": "Seriously though, a \"minor\" complaint can actually be pretty serious.

It's a front-row seat to the human condition, and you see everything from the truly heartbreaking to the utterly absurd. If you're thinking of going into emergency medicine, just remember: bring your sense of humour, your comfy shoes, and maybe a lifetime supply of chai.
