{"unnormalised": "So, you wanna know about Emergency Medicine (EM) in India, huh? Well, it's not exactly like what you see in Bollywood or Hollywood. Think less dramatic slow-mo walking and more... organised chaos. EM is still a relatively young specialty here, but it's growing super fast. We're talking about everything from road accidents in Delhi to heart attacks in Kerala. The pressure is on, bhai!", "normalised": "So, you want to know about Emergency Medicine (E-M) in India, huh?

{"unnormalised": "The main challenge? Sheer volume. Imagine, a single emergency room (ER) at AIIMS Delhi handling hundreds of patients every day. That’s not an exaggeration! We're talking about serious cases, from stabbings (unfortunately, pretty common) to kids swallowing stuff they shouldn’t. And resources? Sometimes stretched thin. You might find 1 doctor covering 20+ patients at once. We do our best with what we have, though.", "normalised": "The main challenge? Sheer volume.

Then there are the poisoning cases, especially in rural areas where pesticides are easily available. And don't forget the snake bites, particularly during monsoon season in states like West Bengal. It’s a whole different world!", "normalised": "Common emergencies? Road Traffic Accidents (R-T-A-s) are huge, especially in cities like Mumbai and Chennai.

{"unnormalised": "Now, about training. Getting into EM residency is tough, but more hospitals are offering it now. You’ve got places like CMC Vellore, JIPMER Pondicherry, and many of the Apollo hospitals offering good programs. A typical EM residency might involve rotating through different departments – cardiology, surgery, even ICU. Plus, a whole lotta on-the-job training in the ER itself.", "normalised": "Now, about training. Getting into E-M residency is tough, but more hospitals are offering it now.

{"unnormalised": "So, yeah, Emergency Medicine in India is a challenging field, but also super rewarding. You're literally saving lives every day. Just remember, you need a cool head, quick reflexes, and the ability to handle immense pressure. And maybe a strong cup of chai to get you through those long shifts. Think you’ve got what it takes? All the best, yaar!", "normalised": "So, yeah, Emergency Medicine in India is a challenging field, but also super rewarding. You are literally saving lives every day.
