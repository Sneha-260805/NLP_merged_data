Initially, the triage nurse, Ms. Sharma, seemed efficient, quickly assessing his vitals – BP was 160/100, and pulse was 110 bpm. An ECG was ordered STAT, but it took almost 45 mins for it to be done. That’s when things started going downhill, IMO.", "normalised": "My father, Mister Rajesh Kumar, sixty eight years old, was rushed to City Hospital on eighth May two thousand and twenty four after experiencing severe chest pain. We reached the E-R at around ten thirty P-M. Initially, the triage nurse, Missus Sharma, seemed efficient, quickly assessing his vitals – B-P was one hundred and sixty divided by one hundred, and pulse was one hundred and ten B-P-M. An E-C-G was ordered S-T-A-T, but it took almost forty five minutes for it to be done. That’s when things started going downhill, in my opinion."}
{"unnormalised": "The ECG report suggested a possible STEMI. However, there seemed to be a significant delay in getting a cardiologist to review it. We kept asking the nurses, but they kept saying, \"Doctor is on his way.\" It wasn't until almost 1:00 AM that Dr. Verma finally showed up. He reviewed the ECG and confirmed the STEMI diagnosis, ordering immediate thrombolysis with Inj. Streptokinase 1.5 million units IV.", "normalised": "The E-C-G report suggested a possible S-T-E-M-I.

{"unnormalised": "The thrombolysis, thankfully, went smoothly. But throughout the ordeal, the communication was terrible. No one explained the risks and benefits of the treatment properly. They just rushed through everything. We found out later that City Hospital has a cath lab, but they didn't even consider angioplasty as an option initially, which I believe is the gold standard now. It felt like they opted for the cheaper option because it was late at night and Dr. Verma likely didn't want to call in the interventional cardiologist. The bill came out to Rs. 45,000, which seemed excessive for the level of care we received.", "normalised": "The thrombolysis, thankfully, went smoothly.
