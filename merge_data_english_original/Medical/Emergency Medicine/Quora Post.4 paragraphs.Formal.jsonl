Check for immediate threats to life, such as airway obstruction, breathing difficulties, or severe bleeding. If the person is unresponsive, immediately check for a pulse and breathing.

If the person is having difficulty breathing, try to keep them in a comfortable position, preferably sitting upright. In case of suspected fractures, immobilize the affected limb. Avoid moving the person unnecessarily, especially if there is a suspicion of spinal injury.
