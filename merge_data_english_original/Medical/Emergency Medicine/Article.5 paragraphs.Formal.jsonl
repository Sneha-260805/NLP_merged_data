{"unnormalised": "Emergency medicine in India faces numerous challenges. A significant hurdle is the lack of pre-hospital care infrastructure. For instance, patients arriving at AIIMS, Delhi after a heart attack often haven't received any intervention in the crucial 'golden hour'. This leads to poorer outcomes. Ambulance services, even in major cities like Mumbai, are often delayed due to traffic congestion and a lack of public awareness, exacerbating conditions like strokes where every minute counts. Furthermore, the availability of advanced life support ambulances with trained paramedics is limited, particularly in rural areas.", "normalised": "Emergency medicine in India faces numerous challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Hospital emergency departments are frequently overwhelmed. Govt hospitals such as KEM Hospital in Mumbai regularly see patient volumes exceeding their capacity. This results in longer waiting times, potentially delaying treatment for critical conditions. The shortage of trained emergency medicine physicians and nurses is a constant concern. Many hospitals rely on rotating staff from other specialties, leading to inconsistencies in care. Data from 2022 indicates that only about 10% of hospitals in India have dedicated emergency medicine departments staffed by specialists.", "normalised": "Hospital emergency departments are frequently overwhelmed.

{"unnormalised": "Specific challenges are also faced with different types of emergencies. Road traffic accidents are a major contributor to trauma cases. The lack of adherence to traffic rules and poor road infrastructure contribute to a high incidence of serious injuries. In rural areas, snakebites and agricultural accidents are common, requiring specialized training and resources. The availability of anti-snake venom (ASV) is often limited, and timely access to medical facilities can be difficult.", "normalised": "Specific challenges are also faced with different types of emergencies.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the progress, significant investment is needed to strengthen emergency medicine in India. This includes improving infrastructure, training more healthcare professionals, increasing public awareness, and strengthening coordination between pre-hospital and hospital care. Funding should be allocated to upgrade emergency departments, equip ambulances with necessary equipment, and ensure the availability of essential medications. Legislation mandating the establishment of emergency medicine departments in all hospitals would further solidify this critical aspect of healthcare delivery, with potential revisions needed by the end of FY 2024-25.", "normalised": "Despite the progress, significant investment is needed to strengthen emergency medicine in India.
