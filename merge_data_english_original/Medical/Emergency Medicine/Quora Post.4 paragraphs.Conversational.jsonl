You see so many auto-rickshaws, bikes, and even the occasional tractor involved in crashes, especially near places like NH-44.

We see a lot of cases where people present with chest pain around 6 AM, thinking it's just acidity. Dr. Sharma often says, \"Time is muscle,\" meaning the sooner you get to the hospital, the better. Remember, places like Fortis Hospitals have specialized cardiac units. Don’t delay if you feel something’s not right.", "normalised": "Heart attacks and strokes are unfortunately quite common.

A quick trip to the ER is crucial, and knowing the type of snake helps a lot with the treatment. A dose of anti-snake venom is the usual treatment. So, yeah, ERs in India are pretty busy places, dealing with all sorts of emergencies. Hope this helps!", "normalised": "Finally, there are the snake bites, especially in rural areas and during monsoon season.
