They'll quickly assess the severity of your condition. If it's a genuine emergency like a suspected heart attack (chest pain, etc.), or a major accident, you'll likely be seen ASAP. Expect questions about your symptoms, medical history, and any meds you're taking. They might ask about known allergies too.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about what to expect in an E-R in India.

So someone with a minor cut might wait longer than someone with difficulty breathing. Expect tests - blood tests, ECG, X-rays, possibly even a CT scan depending on the situation. The docs, like Dr. Sharma from AIIMS (personal example!), will review results & determine the best course of action.

Govt. hospitals like CMC Vellore are cheaper, but might have longer wait times and be more crowded. Keep any insurance info handy. Also, prepone asking about costs upfront if possible.
