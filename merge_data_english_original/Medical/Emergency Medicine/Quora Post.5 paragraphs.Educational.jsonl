Firstly, knowing who to call is crucial. 108 is the emergency number for ambulance services in most states. Keep that number handy. Many private hospitals like Apollo, Max, and Fortis also have their own ambulance services, so knowing their direct numbers for your area can be a lifesaver.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about emergency medicine in India, and I thought I would share some basics.

Similarly, sudden paralysis or weakness on one side of the body could indicate a stroke. Get the person to the nearest hospital ASAP. Keep an eye out for difficulty breathing, uncontrolled bleeding, or severe head injuries – all require immediate medical attention. Remember, early intervention often determines the outcome.", "normalised": "Next, what constitutes an emergency? Chest pain, especially if it is radiating down the left arm, is a definite red flag.

{"unnormalised": "Regarding first aid, CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a vital skill. There are numerous online resources and training centers that teach this. The Indian Red Cross Society offers CPR training courses. Knowing basic first aid can stabilize a patient until professional help arrives. For instance, applying direct pressure to a bleeding wound can significantly reduce blood loss. In case of fractures, try to immobilize the limb with a splint (a rolled-up newspaper works in a pinch) to prevent further injury.", "normalised": "Regarding first aid, C-P-R (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a vital skill.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to communicate clearly with the emergency responders. Provide them with the patient’s age, medical history (if known), symptoms, and any medications they are currently taking. Mention any allergies to medications. Accurate and concise information helps the medical team prepare and provide the most appropriate treatment. For example, telling them \"Patient is Rakesh, 62 years old, history of diabetes, experiencing chest pain since 15 minutes\" is much more helpful than just saying \"he has chest pain\".", "normalised": "Finally, remember to communicate clearly with the emergency responders.
