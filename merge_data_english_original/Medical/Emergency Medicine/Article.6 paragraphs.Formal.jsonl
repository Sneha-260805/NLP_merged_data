{"unnormalised": "Emergency medicine in India faces numerous challenges. Access to timely care is often hampered by factors such as traffic congestion, especially in metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi. Reaching hospitals like AIIMS or Fortis during peak hours can add critical minutes, potentially impacting patient outcomes. The golden hour, crucial in trauma cases, becomes a significant hurdle. Furthermore, pre-hospital care is often limited, with basic life support skills not widely disseminated among the general public. 108 ambulance services, while present, sometimes struggle with reaching patients in remote areas or navigating densely populated urban centers.", "normalised": "Emergency medicine in India faces numerous challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The training of emergency medical personnel needs strengthening. While institutions like CMC Vellore offer specialized courses, there is a shortage of adequately trained paramedics and emergency physicians across the country. Many hospitals, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, lack dedicated emergency departments with sufficient staffing and resources. Nurses and junior doctors are often the first responders, handling critical situations with limited specialized training. The availability of advanced life support equipment, such as ventilators and defibrillators, is also unevenly distributed.", "normalised": "The training of emergency medical personnel needs strengthening.

{"unnormalised": "The prevalence of road traffic accidents contributes significantly to the burden on emergency services. Data from the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways indicates a high number of fatalities and serious injuries each year. These accidents often require immediate surgical intervention and specialized care. Similarly, cardiac emergencies, such as heart attacks, are increasingly common, particularly in younger populations. Timely administration of thrombolytic therapy, ideally within 60 mins of symptom onset, is often delayed due to logistical challenges and lack of awareness.", "normalised": "The prevalence of road traffic accidents contributes significantly to the burden on emergency services.

{"unnormalised": "Resource constraints pose a persistent challenge. Many public hospitals struggle with overcrowding and limited bed capacity, making it difficult to provide optimal care to all patients in need. The cost of emergency medical services can also be a barrier to access for low-income individuals and families. Schemes like Ayushman Bharat aim to address this issue, but universal healthcare coverage remains a distant goal. Furthermore, the procurement and maintenance of essential medical equipment require significant investment.", "normalised": "Resource constraints pose a persistent challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Moving forward, a multi-pronged approach is needed to strengthen emergency medicine in India. This includes investing in infrastructure, expanding training programs, improving pre-hospital care, leveraging technology, and addressing resource constraints. Public awareness campaigns can educate citizens about basic life support skills and the importance of seeking timely medical attention. Collaborations between government agencies, healthcare providers, and non-governmental organizations are essential to create a robust and equitable emergency medical system that can effectively serve the needs of the entire population. Initiatives such as increasing the number of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) certified professionals and implementing standardized emergency protocols across hospitals can significantly improve patient outcomes.", "normalised": "Moving forward, a multi-pronged approach is needed to strengthen emergency medicine in India.
