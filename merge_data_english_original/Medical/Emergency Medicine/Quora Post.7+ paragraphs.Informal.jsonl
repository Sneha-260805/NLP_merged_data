{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about emergency medicine in India, right? Like, what to expect? Well, it's a mixed bag, honestly. Depends a lot on where you are. Big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore? You’ll likely find decent hospitals with ER depts. that have the basics. Places like AIIMS, Fortis, Apollo, they're generally okay. You can expect docs, nurses, and some equipment, hopefully enough to stabilize you. They usually have specialists on call too, like cardiologists or neurosurgeons, if you need them urgently. Avg. wait time is around 20-30 mins to see a doc.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about emergency medicine in India, right? Like, what to expect? Well, it's a mixed bag, honestly.

{"unnormalised": "But, and this is a big but, don’t expect miracles. Resources are stretched thin, especially in public hospitals. You might be waiting longer, sometimes hours, even if it’s an emergency. Plus, the standard of care can vary wildly. Something like a heart attack? They’ll probably do an ECG and give you aspirin, but the speed and availability of things like angioplasty depend on the hospital and your ability to pay. You can always consult with Dr. Amit Patel for cardio related problems.", "normalised": "But, and this is a big but, don't expect miracles.

{"unnormalised": "Rural areas? Forget about it, bhai. Honestly, if you're in a serious accident in some remote village, your best bet is to get to the nearest town with a decent hospital ASAP. They might have a basic clinic, but proper emergency care is rare. There might be a primary health center run by govt. with 1 or 2 docs. And good luck finding an ambulance quickly. Dial 108, maybe, but don't count on it reaching you in time.", "normalised": "Rural areas? Forget about it, bhai.

{"unnormalised": "Cost is another factor. Private hospitals are expensive, even for basic emergency care. An ambulance ride can set you back a couple of thousand Rupees, and treatment can easily run into lakhs, especially for serious stuff like trauma or heart attacks. Insurance helps, but even then, you might have to pay upfront and claim it later. Govt. hospitals are cheaper, of course, but they're usually overcrowded and understaffed, leading to longer wait times.

{"unnormalised": "Things are improving, slowly but surely. The govt. is trying to improve emergency services, but it's a slow process. More ambulances, better training for paramedics, more investment in hospitals. But there's still a long way to go. Also, awareness among the public is low.

{"unnormalised": "So, my advice? Be prepared. Know the location of the nearest hospital with an emergency department. Have your insurance details handy. Learn basic first aid. And most importantly, stay safe. Drive carefully, wear your helmet, and be aware of your surroundings.
