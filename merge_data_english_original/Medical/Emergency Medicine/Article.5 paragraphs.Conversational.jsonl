{"unnormalised": "One of the most common emergencies is a sudden allergic reaction. Maybe Priya ate something with peanuts and her face starts swelling up. In such cases, immediately administer an antihistamine if you have it, and rush her to the nearest hospital, like Max Healthcare. Don't wait for symptoms to subside; these reactions can escalate quickly. Remember to tell the ER staff exactly what she ate and any medication she's on. Getting a shot of epinephrine (EpiPen) may be crucial.", "normalised": "One of the most common emergencies is a sudden allergic reaction.

{"unnormalised": "Accidents, of course, are always a possibility. A fall leading to a broken bone is a medical emergency and needing immediate attention. For example, Aisha's grandmother fell in the bathroom and has a suspected fracture in her left leg. Stabilize the leg with a splint if possible (a rolled-up newspaper will do in a pinch) and get her to a hospital like AIIMS. Avoid moving her unnecessarily. An X-ray will probably be needed to confirm, and perhaps surgery.", "normalised": "Accidents, of course, are always a possibility.
