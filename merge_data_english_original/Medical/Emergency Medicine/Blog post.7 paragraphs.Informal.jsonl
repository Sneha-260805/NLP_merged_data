{"unnormalised": "My first week was a total eye-opener. I mean, I'd read about emergency medicine in textbooks, but nothing prepares you for the reality. One minute you're helping Dr. Sharma stitch up a kid who fell off his bike (thankfully, just a minor scrape), and the next you're assisting with a cardiac arrest case. It's intense! And the sheer volume of patients is staggering. On an average day, we see about 200-250 patients.", "normalised": "My first week was a total eye-opener.

{"unnormalised": "And the cases! From road accidents involving autos (those things are a menace, tbh) to folks suffering from heatstroke during the peak of summer, we've seen it all. One evening, a family rushed in with their grandfather, complaining of severe chest pain. Turns out, he'd been celebrating Diwali a bit too enthusiastically with sweets and firecrackers and his blood pressure had shot up to 200/120. Scary stuff!", "normalised": "And the cases!

{"unnormalised": "Of course, amidst the emergencies, there are lighter moments too. I remember this one patient, an elderly lady who came in with a minor cut. She was more worried about missing her favorite soap opera at 8 PM than getting treated. We all had a good laugh about that. Also the number of requests for paracetamol 650mg are quite high.", "normalised": "Of course, amidst the emergencies, there are lighter moments too.

{"unnormalised": "But what really sticks with me is the incredible dedication of the doctors and nurses. They work tirelessly, often for 12-14 hrs straight, without a single complaint. They are truly unsung heroes, especially at places like AIIMS and Safdarjung, dealing with such high patient loads and limited resources. The head nurse, Sister Mary, is a force of nature – she runs that ER like a well-oiled machine.", "normalised": "But what really sticks with me is the incredible dedication of the doctors and nurses.

{"unnormalised": "And the patients, despite being in pain or distress, are often incredibly grateful and resilient. You see so much humanity in those moments. The genuine smiles, the hopeful look in their eyes… that's what makes it all worthwhile. It also makes you think about how fragile life is, and how important it is to appreciate every moment.", "normalised": "And the patients, despite being in pain or distress, are often incredibly grateful and resilient.

{"unnormalised": "So, yeah, that's a glimpse into my ER diaries. It's challenging, chaotic, and often heartbreaking, but it's also incredibly rewarding. I'm learning so much, not just about medicine, but about life, compassion, and the incredible strength of the human spirit. Next time you see a doctor or nurse, remember the hard work they put in, especially in emergency situations. They're doing their best to save lives, one patient at a time. And sometimes, all they need is a strong cup of chai and a moment to breathe.", "normalised": "So, yeah, that's a glimpse into my E-R diaries.
