{"unnormalised": "Firstly, pre-hospital care in India differs significantly from Western models. While ambulance services like 108 exist, accessibility and response times can vary widely, particularly in rural areas. Often, bystanders or family members transport patients to the hospital. Therefore, basic first aid knowledge is crucial for the general public. Understanding how to manage common emergencies like heart attacks or strokes before reaching medical professionals is extremely important. For example, CPR and the Heimlich maneuver can be life-saving in many situations.", "normalised": "firstly, pre-hospital care in india differs significantly from western models. while ambulance services like one zero eight exist, accessibility and response times can vary widely, particularly in rural areas. often, bystanders or family members transport patients to the hospital. therefore, basic first aid knowledge is crucial for the general public. understanding how to manage common emergencies like heart attacks or strokes before reaching medical professionals is extremely important. for example, C-P-R and the heimlich maneuver can be life-saving in many situations."}
{"unnormalised": "Secondly, triage protocols are essential in Indian emergency departments (EDs) due to high patient volumes. Hospitals often operate at or above capacity, so prioritization based on severity is crucial. The triage process often involves assessment by a nurse and a junior doctor. Patients are categorized based on factors such as vital signs and level of consciousness. Critical patients, such as those experiencing respiratory distress or cardiac arrest, are given immediate attention. Less urgent cases may experience longer wait times. Knowing this information can help manage expectations.", "normalised": "secondly, triage protocols are essential in indian emergency departments (E-D-s) due to high patient volumes. hospitals often operate at or above capacity, so prioritization based on severity is crucial. the triage process often involves assessment by a nurse and a junior doctor. patients are categorized based on factors such as vital signs and level of consciousness. critical patients, such as those experiencing respiratory distress or cardiac arrest, are given immediate attention. less urgent cases may experience longer wait times. knowing this information can help manage expectations."}
{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, specialized emergency care is not universally available across India. While tertiary care hospitals in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai may have dedicated trauma centers and cardiac units, smaller towns and rural areas may lack such facilities. This disparity affects the quality of care that patients receive. In these cases, telemedicine services can play a vital role in helping provide timely consultation with specialists. Having a basic understanding of the nearest medical facilities is key.", "normalised": "thirdly, specialized emergency care is not universally available across india. while tertiary care hospitals in metropolitan cities like mumbai, delhi and chennai may have dedicated trauma centers and cardiac units, smaller towns and rural areas may lack such facilities. this disparity affects the quality of care that patients receive. in these cases, telemedicine services can play a vital role in helping provide timely consultation with specialists. having a basic understanding of the nearest medical facilities is key."}
{"unnormalised": "Lastly, understanding medication availability and costs is also important. The generic names and dosages used may differ. Many pharmacies carry different brands of the same medicine. Also, knowing prices beforehand is helpful. In emergency situations, time is of the essence, and any delay in acquiring medications can have serious consequences. Be aware of government schemes like Ayushman Bharat, which provide financial assistance for medical treatments.", "normalised": "lastly, understanding medication availability and costs is also important. the generic names and dosages used may differ. many pharmacies carry different brands of the same medicine. also, knowing prices beforehand is helpful. in emergency situations, time is of the essence, and any delay in acquiring medications can have serious consequences. be aware of government schemes like ayushman bharat, which provide financial assistance for medical treatments."}
