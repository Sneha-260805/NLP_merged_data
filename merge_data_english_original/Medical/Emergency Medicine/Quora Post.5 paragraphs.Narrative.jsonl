He was saying it felt like an \"elephant sitting on my chest.\" My aunt immediately started reciting Hanuman Chalisa, while I called 102 for an ambulance. Trying to keep calm, I remembered some basic first aid. I asked him if he had any allergies or medical conditions. Turns out, he's allergic to shellfish, and we had a prawn dish that evening.

{"unnormalised": "Thankfully, Rohan made a full recovery. The whole experience was a wake-up call. We learned the importance of knowing about allergies, having emergency contacts readily available, and knowing the closest hospitals. Most importantly, calling for an ambulance (102) ASAP can truly save a life. And if you suspect anaphylaxis, an EpiPen (if available) can be a game-changer, but always follow up with proper medical treatment.
