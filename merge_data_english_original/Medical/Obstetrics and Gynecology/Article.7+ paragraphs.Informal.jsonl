{"unnormalised": "Firstly, what *is* obstetrics and gynecology, or \"OB-GYN\" as the cool kids (and your doctors, most likely) call it? Obstetrics deals with pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period – think everything from prenatal checkups to delivering your little bundle of joy. Gynecology, on the other hand, focuses on the female reproductive system – your uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. That means everything from period problems to contraception to menopause falls under this umbrella.", "normalised": "Firstly, what *is* obstetrics and gynecology, or \"O-B G-Y-N\" as the cool kids (and your doctors, most likely) call it?

{"unnormalised": "Now, when should you actually *see* an OB-GYN? Well, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that girls have their first visit between the ages of 13 and 15. Even if you’re not sexually active, it’s a good time to establish a relationship with a doctor and ask any questions you might have. However, here in India, it is often seen that the first visit happens only when someone is getting married or planning for a baby. Post marriage if you are planning for a baby, do consult a gynecologist.", "normalised": "Now, when should you actually *see* an O-B G-Y-N?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of things we don't discuss enough, let's talk about contraception. There are so many options available these days, from the good ol' condoms to IUDs, the pill, and even permanent sterilization. A good OB-GYN can help you figure out what's best for your lifestyle and health. Don't just rely on what your friends tell you or what you read online! Proper medical advice is crucial. Common queries that most of the women have are around usage of I pill/ emergency contraceptive pills. Keep in mind that these are not a regular birth control option and are only to be used in an emergency. Consulting a doctor and discussing all options is necessary.", "normalised": "Speaking of things we don't discuss enough, let's talk about contraception.

{"unnormalised": "Another biggie: regular checkups. Ladies, please, please, *please* prioritize these. Think of it like servicing your car – you need to keep everything running smoothly. That means regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer (starting at age 21, and usually done every 3 years), breast exams (your doctor can show you how to do self-exams too!), and screenings for STIs. Remember, early detection is key for many conditions. Plus, it’s a chance to ask your doctor about any concerns you have.", "normalised": "Another biggie: regular checkups.

{"unnormalised": "What are some common issues Indian women face? Well, PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a big one, affecting a significant percentage. Then there’s endometriosis, fibroids, and of course, the ever-present stress of managing work, family, and everything in between, which can mess with your hormones and your cycle. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about these – they've seen it all before! I know it's sometimes difficult to express your concerns in English, but many doctors are fluent in Hindi or other regional languages, so don't hesitate to ask for clarification or assistance.", "normalised": "What are some common issues Indian women face?

Read online reviews, but take them with a grain of salt. And most importantly, find someone you feel comfortable talking to – someone who listens to your concerns and explains things clearly. Finding an OB-GYN who’s a good fit is a crucial step in taking control of your reproductive health. Remember to discuss all of your medical history with the doctor including any past illnesses or medical conditions you have had. Be open about your sexual health too.
