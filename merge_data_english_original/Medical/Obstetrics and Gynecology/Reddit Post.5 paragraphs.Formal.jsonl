My wife, Priya Sharma, is currently 32 weeks pregnant, and her Dr., Dr. Mehra at Cloudnine Hospital, mentioned something about needing an amniocentesis. Honestly, I'm a bit freaked out. I mean, I’ve read some stuff online, but it's mostly conflicting info.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to get some informed opinions on something that has been on my mind.

{"unnormalised": "From what I understand, amniocentesis involves taking a sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. Dr. Mehra suggested it because the nuchal translucency scan during the 1st trimester showed slightly elevated levels (2.8mm, to be exact) which can sometimes indicate chromosomal abnormalities. She reassured us that it's a routine procedure, but the risks, even if small (stated to be around 1 in 300), are still concerning. Especially the possibility of miscarriage.", "normalised": "From what I understand, amniocentesis involves taking a sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby.

{"unnormalised": "We've already done the non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and the results came back low risk for Down syndrome and other common trisomies. I’m not sure if an amnio is really necessary now, especially since it’s already costing us around Rs. 8,000 for the procedure alone. I've also read about newer, more precise screening tests that can provide a good level of certainty without any invasive methods.", "normalised": "We have already done the non-invasive prenatal testing (N-I-P-T), and the results came back low risk for Down syndrome and other common trisomies.
