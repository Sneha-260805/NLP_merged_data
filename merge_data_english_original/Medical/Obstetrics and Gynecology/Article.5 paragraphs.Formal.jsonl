{"unnormalised": "Recent advancements in obstetrics and gynecology have significantly impacted women's healthcare in India. A growing concern is the increasing incidence of gestational diabetes, affecting approximately 15% of pregnancies, particularly in urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi. Dr. Lakshmi Rao at AIIMS New Delhi, in her recent publication, highlighted the importance of early screening, ideally between 24-28 wks of gestation, using a 75-gram glucose tolerance test (GTT). Management typically involves dietary modifications and, in some cases, insulin therapy. Maternal and fetal outcomes are significantly improved with diligent management, reducing risks such as macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia.", "normalised": "Recent advancements in obstetrics and gynecology have significantly impacted women's healthcare in India.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of focus is the rise in cesarean section rates. In many private hospitals, C-section rates exceed 40%, raising concerns about medically unnecessary interventions. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) advocates for vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) where clinically appropriate. Newer techniques such as vacuum extraction and forceps delivery are also being re-evaluated for their safety and efficacy under strict protocols. A recent audit at Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon, revealed that adhering to the \"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\" initiative correlated with a lower incidence of neonatal complications post delivery.", "normalised": "Another area of focus is the rise in cesarean section rates.

{"unnormalised": "The management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) continues to evolve. Diagnosis often involves evaluating menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne, alongside hormonal assays and ultrasound imaging. Dr. Sharma, at her clinic on MG Road, Pune, emphasizes a holistic approach including lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise, along with pharmacological interventions like metformin and oral contraceptive pills. Infertility related to PCOS can be addressed with ovulation induction using drugs like clomiphene citrate or letrozole, or through assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF. 3 cycles of Clomid are often tried before moving onto more invasive procedures.", "normalised": "The management of polycystic ovary syndrome (P-C-O-S) continues to evolve.

{"unnormalised": "Advancements in minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, have transformed the management of various gynecological conditions. Conditions like uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, and endometriosis can now be treated with smaller incisions, resulting in shorter hospital stays and faster recovery times. The cost of a laparoscopic hysterectomy can range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh, depending on the hospital and the complexity of the procedure. These techniques are increasingly being adopted across major cities in India, providing women with less invasive treatment options.", "normalised": "Advancements in minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, have transformed the management of various gynecological conditions.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, the field of obstetrics and gynecology in India is witnessing significant progress, driven by research, technological advancements, and a growing awareness of women's health issues. Early detection and appropriate management of gestational diabetes, efforts to reduce unnecessary cesarean sections, a comprehensive approach to PCOS management, and the adoption of minimally invasive surgical techniques are all contributing to improved maternal and gynecological health outcomes across the country. Continuous medical education for practitioners, alongside community-based awareness programs, is essential to ensure that women in both urban and rural areas have access to quality healthcare services.", "normalised": "In conclusion, the field of obstetrics and gynecology in India is witnessing significant progress, driven by research, technological advancements, and a growing awareness of women's health issues.
