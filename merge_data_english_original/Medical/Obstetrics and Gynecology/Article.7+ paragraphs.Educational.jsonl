{"unnormalised": "Prenatal care is a cornerstone of OB/GYN practice. Regular check-ups, often starting around 6-8 wks of gestation, are vital for monitoring the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. These visits typically involve physical examinations, blood tests, and ultrasounds. One common condition monitored during prenatal care is gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Screening for gestational diabetes is usually performed between 24-28 wks via a glucose tolerance test (GTT). Management involves dietary changes, exercise, and, in some cases, insulin therapy. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is another concern, particularly preeclampsia, which can develop after 20 wks and pose serious risks to both mother and baby. Regular BP monitoring is essential.", "normalised": "prenatal care is a cornerstone of O-B slash G-Y-N practice. regular check-ups, often starting around six to eight weeks of gestation, are vital for monitoring the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. these visits typically involve physical examinations, blood tests, and ultrasounds. one common condition monitored during prenatal care is gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. screening for gestational diabetes is usually performed between twenty four to twenty eight weeks via a glucose tolerance test (G-T-T). management involves dietary changes, exercise, and, in some cases, insulin therapy. high blood pressure, or hypertension, is another concern, particularly preeclampsia, which can develop after twenty weeks and pose serious risks to both mother and baby. regular B-P monitoring is essential."}
{"unnormalised": "During labor and delivery, complications can arise. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), excessive bleeding after childbirth, is a significant concern and requires prompt management. Another potential issue is postpartum depression (PPD), a mood disorder that can affect women after delivery. Symptoms may include persistent sadness, anxiety, and difficulty bonding with the baby. Treatment options range from therapy to medication, such as antidepressants. Breastfeeding, a natural process, can sometimes present challenges, such as mastitis, an inflammation of the breast tissue, which can be treated with antibiotics and supportive measures. Many doctors recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.", "normalised": "during labor and delivery, complications can arise. postpartum hemorrhage (P-P-H), excessive bleeding after childbirth, is a significant concern and requires prompt management. another potential issue is postpartum depression (P-P-D), a mood disorder that can affect women after delivery. symptoms may include persistent sadness, anxiety, and difficulty bonding with the baby. treatment options range from therapy to medication, such as antidepressants. breastfeeding, a natural process, can sometimes present challenges, such as mastitis, an inflammation of the breast tissue, which can be treated with antibiotics and supportive measures. many doctors recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond pregnancy, OB/GYN care addresses a range of gynecological conditions. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder affecting many women of reproductive age. Symptoms may include irregular periods, excess androgen (male hormone), and polycystic ovaries. Management often involves lifestyle modifications, medications to regulate menstrual cycles, and treatments for infertility. Fibroids, noncancerous growths in the uterus, are another common condition, particularly in women in their 30s and 40s. They can cause heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and frequent urination. Treatment options vary depending on the size and location of the fibroids and may include medication, hormonal therapies, or surgery, such as a hysterectomy.", "normalised": "beyond pregnancy, O-B slash G-Y-N care addresses a range of gynecological conditions. polycystic ovary syndrome (P-C-O-S) is a hormonal disorder affecting many women of reproductive age. symptoms may include irregular periods, excess androgen (male hormone), and polycystic ovaries. management often involves lifestyle modifications, medications to regulate menstrual cycles, and treatments for infertility. fibroids, noncancerous growths in the uterus, are another common condition, particularly in women in their thirties and forties. they can cause heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and frequent urination. treatment options vary depending on the size and location of the fibroids and may include medication, hormonal therapies, or surgery, such as a hysterectomy."}
{"unnormalised": "Infections are also a frequent concern in OB/GYN. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, especially in women, and are typically treated with antibiotics. Vaginal infections, such as yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, are also prevalent and require appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Regular Pap smears, starting at age 21, are crucial for screening for cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can increase the risk of cervical cancer. Vaccination against HPV is recommended for both girls and boys, typically between the ages of 11 and 12.", "normalised": "infections are also a frequent concern in O-B slash G-Y-N. urinary tract infections (U-T-I-s) are common, especially in women, and are typically treated with antibiotics. vaginal infections, such as yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, are also prevalent and require appropriate diagnosis and treatment. regular pap smears, starting at age twenty one, are crucial for screening for cervical cancer. human papillomavirus (H-P-V) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can increase the risk of cervical cancer. vaccination against H-P-V is recommended for both girls and boys, typically between the ages of eleven and twelve."}
{"unnormalised": "Menopause, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55, marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. Symptoms can include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood changes. Hormone therapy (HT) may be an option to manage these symptoms, but it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider. Osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weakened bones, is also a concern after menopause. Regular bone density screenings are recommended, and lifestyle modifications and medications can help prevent and treat osteoporosis. A DEXA scan is generally recommended after the age of 65.", "normalised": "menopause, typically occurring between the ages of forty five and fifty five, marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. symptoms can include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood changes. hormone therapy (H-T) may be an option to manage these symptoms, but it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider. osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weakened bones, is also a concern after menopause. regular bone density screenings are recommended, and lifestyle modifications and medications can help prevent and treat osteoporosis. a D-E-X-A scan is generally recommended after the age of sixty five."}
