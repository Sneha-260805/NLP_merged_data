{"unnormalised": "One significant area of progress is in assisted reproductive technologies (ART). IVF (In-Vitro Fertilization) techniques have become increasingly sophisticated, offering higher success rates for couples struggling with infertility. Many hospitals, such as AIIMS Delhi and CMC Vellore, now provide advanced ART services, including pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and mitochondrial replacement therapy. The cost of IVF cycles, averaging around Rs. 150,000 - Rs. 300,000, is also becoming more accessible through various government and NGO initiatives.", "normalised": "One significant area of progress is in assisted reproductive technologies (ART). I-V-F (In-Vitro Fertilization) techniques have become increasingly sophisticated, offering higher success rates for couples struggling with infertility. Many hospitals, such as A-I-I-M-S Delhi and C-M-C Vellore, now provide advanced A-R-T services, including pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (P-G-D) and mitochondrial replacement therapy. The cost of I-V-F cycles, averaging around rupees one hundred and fifty thousand to rupees three hundred thousand, is also becoming more accessible through various government and N-G-O initiatives."}
{"unnormalised": "Prenatal care has also seen considerable advancements. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), conducted as early as 10 weeks of gestation, is becoming more widely available. NIPT screens for chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome with high accuracy, reducing the need for invasive procedures like amniocentesis. The Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) ensures pregnant women receive comprehensive antenatal care on the 9th of every month, free of cost, at government health facilities.", "normalised": "Prenatal care has also seen considerable advancements. Non-invasive prenatal testing (N-I-P-T), conducted as early as ten weeks of gestation, is becoming more widely available.

{"unnormalised": "In the realm of gynecological oncology, significant strides have been made in the early detection and treatment of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination programs are being implemented across various states, aiming to prevent HPV infection, the primary cause of cervical cancer. Screening methods like liquid-based cytology (LBC) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) are becoming more prevalent. Robotic-assisted surgery, though still relatively expensive (approx. Rs. 2,50,000 - Rs. 5,00,000 per procedure), is gaining traction for complex gynecological surgeries, offering benefits like reduced blood loss and shorter recovery times.", "normalised": "In the realm of gynecological oncology, significant strides have been made in the early detection and treatment of cervical cancer.

{"unnormalised": "Minimally invasive surgical techniques, including laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, are now widely used for various gynecological conditions, such as fibroids, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts. These procedures offer smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgeries. Many gynecologists, like Dr. Meena Sharma at Fortis Hospital, specialize in these advanced surgical techniques.", "normalised": "Minimally invasive surgical techniques, including laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, are now widely used for various gynecological conditions, such as fibroids, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts.

{"unnormalised": "Telemedicine and digital health technologies are also playing a role in improving access to obstetric and gynecological care, especially in rural areas. Online consultations, remote monitoring of vital signs, and mobile health apps are helping to bridge the gap in healthcare access. These services are particularly valuable for women in remote villages who may not have easy access to specialist care.", "normalised": "Telemedicine and digital health technologies are also playing a role in improving access to obstetric and gynecological care, especially in rural areas.
