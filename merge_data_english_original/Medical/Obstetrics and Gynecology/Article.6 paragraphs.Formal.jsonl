{"unnormalised": "One crucial area of advancement is in prenatal screening and diagnostics. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), a simple blood test performed as early as 10 wks gestation, allows for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome with high accuracy. Furthermore, advanced ultrasound techniques, including 3D and 4D imaging, provide detailed visualization of the fetus, aiding in the early diagnosis of congenital anomalies. Such diagnostics are increasingly available at hospitals like AIIMS, New Delhi, and CMC, Vellore.", "normalised": "one crucial area of advancement is in prenatal screening and diagnostics. non-invasive prenatal testing (N-I-P-T), a simple blood test performed as early as ten weeks gestation, allows for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities such as down syndrome with high accuracy. furthermore, advanced ultrasound techniques, including three D and four D imaging, provide detailed visualization of the fetus, aiding in the early diagnosis of congenital anomalies. such diagnostics are increasingly available at hospitals like A-I-I-M-S, new delhi, and C-M-C, vellore."}
{"unnormalised": "In the realm of assisted reproductive technology (ART), significant progress has been made in improving success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) have become increasingly common. ICSI involves the direct injection of a single sperm into an egg, while PGT allows for the screening of embryos for genetic disorders before implantation. Many fertility clinics in Mumbai and Delhi offer these advanced treatments, often quoting costs around Rs. 2,50,000 to Rs. 4,00,000 per cycle.", "normalised": "in the realm of assisted reproductive technology (A-R-T), significant progress has been made in improving success rates of in vitro fertilization (I-V-F). techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (I-C-S-I) and preimplantation genetic testing (P-G-T) have become increasingly common. I-C-S-I involves the direct injection of a single sperm into an egg, while P-G-T allows for the screening of embryos for genetic disorders before implantation. many fertility clinics in mumbai and delhi offer these advanced treatments, often quoting costs around rupees two lakh fifty thousand to rupees four lakh per cycle."}
{"unnormalised": "Minimally invasive surgical techniques have revolutionized gynecological procedures. Laparoscopic surgery, using small incisions and specialized instruments, allows for the treatment of various conditions, including endometriosis, fibroids, and ovarian cysts, with reduced pain, scarring, and recovery time. Hysterectomies, once performed via open surgery, are now frequently done laparoscopically. Robotic surgery, though less widely available due to the high cost (approx. Rs. 3 lakhs at some private hospitals), offers even greater precision and control.", "normalised": "minimally invasive surgical techniques have revolutionized gynecological procedures. laparoscopic surgery, using small incisions and specialized instruments, allows for the treatment of various conditions, including endometriosis, fibroids, and ovarian cysts, with reduced pain, scarring, and recovery time. hysterectomies, once performed via open surgery, are now frequently done laparoscopically. robotic surgery, though less widely available due to the high cost (approximately rupees three lakhs at some private hospitals), offers even greater precision and control."}
{"unnormalised": "Postpartum care is another area that has seen improvements. There's a growing emphasis on promoting breastfeeding and providing comprehensive postpartum support to new mothers. Initiatives such as the Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) aim to ensure timely antenatal and postnatal care, including vaccinations and nutritional support. Many govt hospitals now offer postnatal checkups scheduled for 6 wks after delivery.", "normalised": "postpartum care is another area that has seen improvements. there's a growing emphasis on promoting breastfeeding and providing comprehensive postpartum support to new mothers. initiatives such as the mother and child tracking system (M-C-T-S) aim to ensure timely antenatal and postnatal care, including vaccinations and nutritional support. many government hospitals now offer postnatal checkups scheduled for six weeks after delivery."}
