{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about common issues in obstetrics and gynecology, and honestly, there are quite a few! From personal experience, I can tell you it's a wide field. You've got everything from routine prenatal check-ups to more complex procedures. Think about a typical pregnancy - lots of blood tests, usually around the 12th week, and ultrasounds, right? Sometimes you'll hear terms like \"GDM\" being thrown around, which stands for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. It's pretty common, especially in India, and usually managed with diet and exercise, maybe even medication in some cases.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about common issues in obstetrics and gynecology, and honestly, there are quite a few!

{"unnormalised": "Then there are issues like PCOD/PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). I’ve heard so many women discussing it; it seems to be on the rise. Symptoms can vary - irregular periods, weight gain, acne – and diagnosis often involves blood tests to check hormone levels and an ultrasound. Treatment options range from lifestyle changes to medication like Metformin. My cousin, Aisha, was diagnosed last year and she’s been managing it with a healthy diet and regular yoga. Consult Dr. Sharma for diagnosis, charges are around Rs. 500/-.", "normalised": "Then there are issues like P-C-O-D slash P-C-O-S (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome).

{"unnormalised": "Beyond pregnancy and PCOD, there are other things like fibroids (non-cancerous growths in the uterus), which can cause heavy bleeding and pain. Treatment can be anything from medication to surgery, depending on the size and location of the fibroids.
