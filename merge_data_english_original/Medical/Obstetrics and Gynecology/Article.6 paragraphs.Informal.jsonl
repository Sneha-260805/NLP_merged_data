{"unnormalised": "Obstetrics and Gynecology, or OB-GYN as many call it, is a constantly evolving field. In India, with its diverse population and healthcare infrastructure, the challenges and advancements are quite unique. Dr. Sharma from AIIMS, Delhi, highlighted in a recent conference that we're seeing a rise in complex pregnancies, often complicated by factors like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, which require specialized care. There’s also the ongoing need to improve maternal mortality rates, particularly in rural areas.", "normalised": "Obstetrics and Gynecology, or O-B-G-Y-N as many call it, is a constantly evolving field.

{"unnormalised": "One significant area of progress is in minimally invasive surgery. Procedures like laparoscopic hysterectomies and myomectomies are becoming more common, offering patients shorter recovery times and smaller scars. Fortis Hospital, Mumbai, has invested heavily in robotic surgery, allowing for even greater precision and control. For example, a robotic-assisted myomectomy can now be completed in approx. 2 hours.", "normalised": "One significant area of progress is in minimally invasive surgery.

{"unnormalised": "The use of advanced imaging techniques, such as 3D and 4D ultrasounds, has also become more prevalent. These technologies allow for better visualization of fetal development and can aid in the early detection of congenital abnormalities. Plus, its easier for expecting parents to get a good look at their lil' one! Prenatal screening for conditions like Down syndrome using NIPT (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing) is also gaining traction, offering a safer alternative to amniocentesis in many cases.", "normalised": "The use of advanced imaging techniques, such as three-D and four-D ultrasounds, has also become more prevalent.

{"unnormalised": "In the realm of assisted reproductive technology (ART), India has emerged as a major hub for IVF (in vitro fertilization). Clinics like Nova IVF Fertility and Indira IVF offer a range of services, including ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). The success rates are improving steadily, but access remains a challenge for many due to the high cost of treatment – sometimes upwards of Rs. 2,00,000 per cycle.", "normalised": "In the realm of assisted reproductive technology (A-R-T), India has emerged as a major hub for I-V-F (in vitro fertilization).

{"unnormalised": "Telemedicine is playing an increasingly important role in OB-GYN care, especially in underserved areas. Dr. Khan from a rural health center in Kerala shared that they’re using video consultations to provide prenatal care to women in remote villages. They also use mobile apps to track pregnancies and provide educational resources. This is crucial, considering many women have to travel 50+ km for a basic checkup.", "normalised": "Telemedicine is playing an increasingly important role in O-B-G-Y-N care, especially in underserved areas.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, there’s a growing focus on personalized medicine and the use of genomics to predict and prevent pregnancy complications. Research is also underway to develop new and more effective treatments for conditions like endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affect a significant proportion of women in India. It’s an exciting time to be in OB-GYN, with so much potential to improve the health and well-being of women across the country.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, there’s a growing focus on personalized medicine and the use of genomics to predict and prevent pregnancy complications.
