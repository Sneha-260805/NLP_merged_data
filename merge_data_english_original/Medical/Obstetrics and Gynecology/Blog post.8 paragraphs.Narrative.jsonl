{"unnormalised": "The first trimester? Let's just say morning sickness wasn't just a \"morning\" thing. It was more like all-day sickness! Ginger chai became my best friend. The gynaecologist, Dr. Patel, prescribed Doxinate for the nausea, but honestly, nothing seemed to help completely.

{"unnormalised": "The second trimester was relatively smooth sailing. I started feeling the baby's movements around 18 weeks. Like little butterflies fluttering in my tummy.
