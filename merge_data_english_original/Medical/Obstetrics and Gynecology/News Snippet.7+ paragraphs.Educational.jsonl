{"unnormalised": "The study identifies several contributing factors, including late antenatal care. Many women in remote areas only seek medical attention after 20 weeks of pregnancy. This delay often complicates the management of conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, nutritional deficiencies remain a significant challenge. The report emphasizes the importance of iron supplementation, especially given that approx. 60% of pregnant women in India are anemic.", "normalised": "The study identifies several contributing factors, including late antenatal care.

{"unnormalised": "Lack of access to advanced diagnostic facilities is another key issue. Many district hospitals lack the infrastructure for timely ultrasounds and other crucial tests. This often leads to delayed diagnoses and suboptimal management of fetal abnormalities. The study also draws attention to the rising incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among younger women. Early detection and lifestyle modifications are crucial to prevent long-term health complications.", "normalised": "Lack of access to advanced diagnostic facilities is another key issue.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the report highlights the shortage of trained healthcare professionals in rural areas. Many primary health centers (PHCs) lack qualified gynecologists and obstetricians. This necessitates task-sharing and capacity-building initiatives to empower nurses and other healthcare workers to provide basic obstetric care. Dr. Sharma advocates for increased investment in medical education and infrastructure to address these challenges.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the report highlights the shortage of trained healthcare professionals in rural areas.
