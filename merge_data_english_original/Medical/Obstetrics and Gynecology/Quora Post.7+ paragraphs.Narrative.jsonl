A whole ten days past my usual twenty eight-day cycle. Panic. Full-blown panic. My husband, Rakesh, was calmer, but I could see the worry in his eyes too. We immediately bought a pregnancy test kit from the local chemist – a \"Prega News\" one, I think it cost rupee fifty or so."}

I'd heard good things about her. The consultation fee was around rupee eight hundred, I believe. She was amazing! She explained everything so clearly.

She explained that irregular periods could be due to various reasons – stress, hormonal imbalances, even something like P-C-O-S."}

We only think about it when something goes wrong or when we're planning a family. But regular gynaecological check-ups are crucial, just like seeing a dentist or a general physician. Don't wait for a scare like mine! Find a good gynaecologist in your area (A-I-I-M-S Delhi, for example, has a good O-B slash G-Y-N department if you’re in Delhi) and get yourself checked out. It's an investment in your future health and peace of mind. I now go for a checkup every year around my birthday, on twenty first July, as a kind of self-care gift. Consider doing the same!"}
