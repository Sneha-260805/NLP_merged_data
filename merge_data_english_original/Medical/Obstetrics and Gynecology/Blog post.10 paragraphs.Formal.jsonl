{"unnormalised": "Obstetrics and Gynecology, often abbreviated as OB/GYN, represents a critical branch of medicine dedicated to women’s health. It encompasses a wide range of services, from prenatal care and childbirth to the diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the female reproductive system.

{"unnormalised": "Prenatal care forms a cornerstone of obstetrics. Regular check-ups with an OB/GYN, like Dr. Aisha Khan at Fortis Hospital, are crucial for monitoring the health of both the mother and the developing baby. These visits typically commence around the 8th week of pregnancy and continue at intervals throughout the pregnancy, often following a schedule of monthly visits initially, transitioning to bi-weekly and then weekly visits closer to the estimated due date (EDD). These appointments involve monitoring vitals (BP, weight), screening for gestational diabetes (GDM), and genetic abnormalities.", "normalised": "Prenatal care forms a cornerstone of obstetrics.

{"unnormalised": "Childbirth, a transformative experience, is another central aspect of obstetrics. OB/GYNs manage labor and delivery, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. Delivery methods range from vaginal births to cesarean sections (C-sections), depending on the circumstances. Postpartum care, including breastfeeding support and monitoring for postpartum depression, is also a critical component of obstetric care.", "normalised": "Childbirth, a transformative experience, is another central aspect of obstetrics.

{"unnormalised": "Gynecology, on the other hand, focuses on the health of the female reproductive system, encompassing the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. It involves the diagnosis and treatment of a wide array of conditions, ranging from common infections like yeast infections (candidiasis) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) to more complex issues like endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and uterine fibroids.", "normalised": "Gynecology, on the other hand, focuses on the health of the female reproductive system, encompassing the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva.

{"unnormalised": "Routine gynecological examinations are essential for preventive care. These typically involve a pelvic exam, a Pap smear (to screen for cervical cancer), and breast exam. The recommended frequency for these exams may vary depending on individual risk factors and guidelines from organizations such as the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI). For example, guidelines often recommend Pap smears every 3 years for women aged 21-65 yrs.", "normalised": "Routine gynecological examinations are essential for preventive care.

{"unnormalised": "Fertility concerns also fall within the purview of gynecology. OB/GYNs can help couples struggling to conceive by performing fertility evaluations, recommending lifestyle modifications, and providing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Several fertility clinics are now available in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, with success rates that are constantly improving.", "normalised": "Fertility concerns also fall within the purview of gynecology.

{"unnormalised": "OB/GYNs are also trained to perform a variety of surgical procedures, including hysterectomies (removal of the uterus), oophorectomies (removal of the ovaries), and myomectomies (removal of uterine fibroids). Minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, are often employed to reduce recovery time and improve patient outcomes.", "normalised": "O-B slash G-Y-Ns are also trained to perform a variety of surgical procedures, including hysterectomies (removal of the uterus), oophorectomies (removal of the ovaries), and myomectomies (removal of uterine fibroids).

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the field addresses issues specific to different age groups. For adolescent girls, OB/GYNs provide guidance on menstruation, contraception, and sexual health. For women in their reproductive years, they offer family planning services, prenatal care, and management of gynecological conditions. For postmenopausal women, they address concerns related to hormonal changes, osteoporosis, and pelvic floor disorders.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the field addresses issues specific to different age groups.

{"unnormalised": "Specialized care within OB/GYN is also common. Some physicians sub-specialize in areas such as maternal-fetal medicine (high-risk pregnancies), reproductive endocrinology and infertility, gynecologic oncology (cancers of the female reproductive system), and urogynecology (pelvic floor disorders). Appointments for such subspecialists may require referrals from a general OB/GYN.", "normalised": "Specialized care within O-B slash G-Y-N is also common.

Regular check-ups, preventive screenings, and prompt management of gynecological conditions are essential for maintaining overall well-being. Consulting with a qualified OB/GYN like Dr. R.
