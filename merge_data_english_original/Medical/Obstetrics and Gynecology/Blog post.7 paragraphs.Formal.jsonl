{"unnormalised": "Prenatal care is a crucial component of obstetrics. It involves monitoring the health of both the mother and the developing fetus throughout pregnancy. Regular visits to an OB/GYN, typically scheduled every 4 weeks until 28 weeks of gestation, then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and weekly thereafter, are essential. These appointments include physical exams, blood tests (e.g., HbA1c), and ultrasounds to assess fetal growth and development. In case of complications, like gestational diabetes, the frequency of visits may increase.", "normalised": "Prenatal care is a crucial component of obstetrics.

{"unnormalised": "Labor and delivery are central to obstetrics. OB/GYNs provide comprehensive care during childbirth, managing both vaginal deliveries and Cesarean sections (C-sections). The choice of delivery method depends on various factors, including the position of the baby, the mother's health, and her preferences. Pain management options, such as epidurals, are also discussed and administered during labor. Many hospitals in India offer \"natural\" or \"water\" births, although acceptance may vary by hospital and doctor's experience.", "normalised": "Labor and delivery are central to obstetrics.

{"unnormalised": "Gynecology addresses a wide range of women's health issues beyond pregnancy. This includes menstrual disorders, such as amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea; infections like bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections; and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Dr. R. Kumar suggests an annual visit for all women over 21 years old or when sexually active. Diagnostic procedures like Pap smears and pelvic exams are performed to screen for cervical cancer and other abnormalities.", "normalised": "Gynecology addresses a wide range of women's health issues beyond pregnancy.

{"unnormalised": "Family planning is an integral part of gynecological care. OB/GYNs offer counseling and prescribe various contraceptive methods, including oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and barrier methods.

{"unnormalised": "Menopause is another significant aspect of women's health addressed by OB/GYNs. This transition period, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55, is characterized by hormonal changes that can cause symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.
