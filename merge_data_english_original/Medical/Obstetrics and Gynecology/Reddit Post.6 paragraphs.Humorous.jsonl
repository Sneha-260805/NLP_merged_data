Doctor Mehra, bless her soul, is always super chill. Told her I was feeling a bit off, like period irregularities and all that jazz. First thing she does? Asks me if I'm preggers. Like, seriously? I'm pretty sure my uterus is as barren as the Thar Desert after the last time I checked. Anyway, she orders a bunch of tests - C-B-C, U-S-G (lower abdomen), and something called a C-A-one-two-five. Said it's just to rule things out. \"Just to rule things out,\" she says, while I'm googling C-A-one-two-five and convinced I have stage four something-or-other."}

Seriously, why do they call it \"routine\"? There's nothing routine about a total stranger poking around your lady bits with metal instruments. She's all like, \"Relax, Priya, just breathe.\" Easy for you to say, Doc! You're not the one with a speculum jammed up there. And then she starts talking about my \"cervix\" and \"ovaries\" like I'm supposed to know where those things are located. Honestly, it's all just a vague, uncomfortable blur south of my waist."}

Sends it off to S-R-L Diagnostics. I get the report, and there's all this medical jargon, like \"A-S-C-U-S\" and \"H-P-V.\" So, naturally, I freak out again.

She also mentioned something about my B-M-I being a bit high (it's twenty eight, okay, I like my gulab jamuns), and that could be affecting my periods. Like, thanks for the body shaming, Doc! Just kidding (mostly)."}
