{"unnormalised": "Pregnancy, while a joyous journey, can sometimes present complications. In India, several factors contribute to specific challenges in obstetrics and gynecology. It's crucial for expectant mothers to be aware and seek timely medical attention. One common complication is gestational diabetes, where blood sugar levels rise during pregnancy. Often managed with diet and exercise, some women may require insulin injections, like 20 units of Insulin NPH before breakfast. Regular monitoring is vital; a fasting blood sugar level of < 90 mg/dL is typically the target.", "normalised": "Pregnancy, while a joyous journey, can sometimes present complications.

One common complication is gestational diabetes, where blood sugar levels rise during pregnancy. Often managed with diet and exercise, some women may require insulin injections, like twenty units of Insulin N-P-H before breakfast. Regular monitoring is vital; a fasting blood sugar level of less than ninety milligram per deciliter is typically the target."}
{"unnormalised": "Another significant concern is pre-eclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, typically after 20 weeks of gestation. This can be serious for both mother and child, potentially leading to premature delivery. Managing blood pressure with medication like Methyldopa 250mg tablets 2 times a day & close monitoring is essential. Undiagnosed pre-eclampsia can even lead to eclampsia, a life-threatening condition involving seizures.", "normalised": "Another significant concern is pre-eclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, typically after twenty weeks of gestation. This can be serious for both mother and child, potentially leading to premature delivery. Managing blood pressure with medication like Methyldopa two hundred and fifty milligram tablets two times a day and close monitoring is essential. Undiagnosed pre-eclampsia can even lead to eclampsia, a life-threatening condition involving seizures."}
{"unnormalised": "Anemia is also highly prevalent, largely due to nutritional deficiencies. Iron deficiency anemia is especially common, demanding iron supplementation; a prescribed dosage might be 325mg Ferrous Sulphate tablets daily, preferably after food. Routine blood tests, particularly monitoring hemoglobin levels, are a must to catch this early. Furthermore, the rising age of first-time mothers, often in their late 20s or early 30s, increases the risk of complications.", "normalised": "Anemia is also highly prevalent, largely due to nutritional deficiencies. Iron deficiency anemia is especially common, demanding iron supplementation; a prescribed dosage might be three hundred and twenty five milligram Ferrous Sulphate tablets daily, preferably after food. Routine blood tests, particularly monitoring hemoglobin levels, are a must to catch this early. Furthermore, the rising age of first-time mothers, often in their late twenties or early thirties, increases the risk of complications."}
{"unnormalised": "Infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), are another concern. Symptoms should not be ignored, and prompt treatment with antibiotics is important; perhaps a 7-day course of Amoxicillin 500mg thrice daily. Left untreated, UTIs can lead to kidney infections and preterm labor. Regular prenatal checkups with a qualified Obstetrician/Gynecologist (like Dr. Sharma at AIIMS) are vital for early detection and management of potential complications.", "normalised": "Infections, such as urinary tract infections (U-T-I-s), are another concern. Symptoms should not be ignored, and prompt treatment with antibiotics is important; perhaps a seven-day course of Amoxicillin five hundred milligram thrice daily. Left untreated, U-T-I-s can lead to kidney infections and preterm labor. Regular prenatal checkups with a qualified Obstetrician slash Gynecologist (like Doctor Sharma at A-I-I-M-S) are vital for early detection and management of potential complications."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, placental issues such as placenta previa or placental abruption can occur, requiring careful monitoring and potentially a C-section. A low-lying placenta might be identified on an ultrasound scan performed around 20 weeks. If any unusual bleeding or abdominal pain occurs, immediate hospitalization is crucial. Remember, early detection, regular check-ups and expert medical care are key to a healthy pregnancy in India.", "normalised": "Finally, placental issues such as placenta previa or placental abruption can occur, requiring careful monitoring and potentially a C-section.
