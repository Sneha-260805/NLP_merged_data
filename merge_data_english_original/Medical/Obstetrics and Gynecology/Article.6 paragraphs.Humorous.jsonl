{"unnormalised": "Okay, ladies (and supportive partners!), let’s be real. Visiting the Obs/Gyn can feel about as fun as navigating a Delhi traffic jam at 5 PM. But fear not! I’m here to inject a little humor into the whole process. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood gynaecologist… minus the actual medical degree and the awkward stirrups.", "normalised": "Okay, ladies (and supportive partners!), let’s be real.

{"unnormalised": "First things first: the waiting room. Armed with a 3-month-old copy of \"Femina\" and the unwavering hope that Dr. Sharma isn't running *too* late today. Pro-tip: Bring snacks. Seriously. A pack of Parle-G biscuits can be the difference between sanity and a hormonal meltdown, especially if you’ve been asked to come in after an overnight fast! My last visit involved a wait time of approximately 1 hour and 15 mins.", "normalised": "First things first: the waiting room.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the examination itself. I won't go into too much detail (we're aiming for humor, not horror), but let's just say the phrase \"internal examination\" sends shivers down more spines than a Bollywood horror flick. Remember, the nurses have seen it all, from \"OMG I think I'm pregnant!\" to \"Is this normal?\" And the good doctors, like Dr. Patel who has been practicing for 20+ years, will be happy to answer your questions. Don’t be shy. (Okay, maybe a *little* shy.)", "normalised": "Then there's the examination itself.

{"unnormalised": "But beyond the awkwardness and the prodding, Obs/Gyn visits are genuinely important. They're like servicing your car, but instead of checking your engine, they're checking your reproductive system (which is arguably more complex, BTW). Regular check-ups can detect issues early, from minor infections to more serious conditions. So whether you’re dealing with PCOS symptoms or planning a family, a visit to a good clinic can be beneficial.", "normalised": "But beyond the awkwardness and the prodding, O-B-S slash G-Y-N visits are genuinely important.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the ever-thrilling world of hormonal imbalances. Ah, hormones! The tiny chemical messengers that control everything from our moods to our menstrual cycles. One minute, we're laughing at cat videos; the next, we're crying over spilled chai. It's all perfectly normal, right? My last blood test result indicated a progesterone level of 2.5 ng/mL. My GP suggested a lifestyle change.", "normalised": "And let's not forget the ever-thrilling world of hormonal imbalances. Ah, hormones!
