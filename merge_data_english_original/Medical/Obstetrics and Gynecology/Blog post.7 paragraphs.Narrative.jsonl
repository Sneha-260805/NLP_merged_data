{"unnormalised": "Namaste, friends! It feels like just yesterday I was a carefree college student in Delhi, enjoying chai with friends and dreaming of the future. Little did I know, my health was about to take an unexpected turn. It all started with irregular periods. At first, I brushed it off – exam stress, late nights, maybe just bad luck. But when I started noticing other symptoms, like sudden weight gain and unwanted facial hair (ugh!), I knew something wasn’t right.", "normalised": "Namaste, friends!

{"unnormalised": "I remember confiding in my mom, and she immediately suggested seeing a gynaecologist. \"Beta, don't take these things lightly,\" she said, her voice filled with concern. And so began my journey to understand PCOS, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. The first consultation was a blur. Dr. Sharma, at Max Hospital, explained that PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting many women, and its symptoms can vary widely. She ordered a series of tests: blood work, ultrasounds – the whole shebang. I felt a mix of anxiety and relief, finally having a direction after months of uncertainty.", "normalised": "I remember confiding in my mom, and she immediately suggested seeing a gynaecologist. \"Beta, don't take these things lightly,\" she said, her voice filled with concern.

{"unnormalised": "The diagnosis hit me hard. PCOS? What did that even mean? Dr. Sharma patiently explained that my ovaries had multiple small cysts, and my hormone levels were out of whack. She prescribed Metformin 500mg, to help with insulin resistance, and suggested lifestyle changes. \"Priya, diet and exercise are key,\" she emphasized. It felt overwhelming. Imagine trying to navigate Delhi traffic and simultaneously trying to follow a strict diet!", "normalised": "The diagnosis hit me hard. P-C-O-S? What did that even mean?

{"unnormalised": "The initial weeks were tough. The meds made me nauseous, and cutting out my favorite mithai was a challenge. But I was determined. I started going for brisk walks every morning, joined a yoga class, and experimented with healthy Indian recipes. Gradually, I started feeling better. The weight started coming off, my skin cleared up a bit, and my periods became (somewhat) more regular. It was a slow process, but I was moving in the right direction. I remember one time I was talking to my friend and I mentioned my FSH and LH levels. He just looked at me blankly, but it felt good to be more informed about my health.", "normalised": "The initial weeks were tough.

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest hurdles was the impact on my fertility. Dr. Sharma had mentioned that PCOS can make it harder to conceive. This was a major concern, as I always dreamed of having a family. I remember sitting at my desk and going through various fertility treatment options that were available. I found the number of IUI treatments vs IVF treatments quite alarming. Although getting married wasn't in the cards right then, it was definitely something to keep in mind.", "normalised": "One of the biggest hurdles was the impact on my fertility.

{"unnormalised": "Throughout this journey, I learned so much about my body, about resilience, and about the power of support. My family, friends, and even online communities of women with PCOS have been a lifeline. They understand the struggles, the frustrations, and the small victories. And that makes all the difference. It also prompted me to find out my AMH levels, just for my own knowledge.", "normalised": "Throughout this journey, I learned so much about my body, about resilience, and about the power of support.

{"unnormalised": "So, to all the women out there facing similar challenges, know that you are not alone. PCOS is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, seek support, and never give up on taking control of your health. And remember, a little bit of self-care, a good doctor (shoutout to Dr. Sharma!), and a strong cup of chai can go a long way. Take care, and stay strong!", "normalised": "So, to all the women out there facing similar challenges, know that you are not alone. P-C-O-S is a marathon, not a sprint.
