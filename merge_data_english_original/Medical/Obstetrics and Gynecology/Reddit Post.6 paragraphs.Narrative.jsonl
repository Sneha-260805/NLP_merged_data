This is going to be a bit of a vent, but also hoping for some advice. My wife, Priya, is expecting our first kid. We are so excited, but honestly, the whole pregnancy journey so far has been… a lot."}

Initially, we consulted Doctor Sharma at Cloudnine Hospital. She was lovely, but getting appointments was a nightmare. The waiting time was usually around two hours. We switched to a smaller clinic closer to our place in Andheri East. Doctor Patel there is great, much more accessible."}

Doctor Patel prescribed some anti-nausea meds, Ondansetron four milligram, which helped a bit. But the fatigue... oh god, the fatigue.

She applied for maternity leave starting from fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four."}

Seeing all those reports and medical jargon is overwhelming. The radiologist pointed out some \"minor shadowing,\" which freaked us out. Doctor Patel reassured us it's within normal range. I've started prepping the baby room with all the essentials. Already spent close to rupees twenty five thousand on clothes, crib and other things."}

The cost difference is significant, and everyone has an opinion – my mom is pushing for natural, my sister-in-law swears by C-section.

My colleague suggested a smaller nursing home could be cheaper."}

Between the physical toll on Priya, the emotional stress, and the financial burden, it's like a whole new level of adulting unlocked.
