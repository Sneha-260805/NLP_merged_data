{"unnormalised": "One prevalent concern is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Characterized by hormonal imbalances, PCOS can manifest in various ways, including irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and acne. Diagnosing PCOS often involves blood tests to check hormone levels and ultrasound scans to assess the ovaries. Management may include lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as well as medications like Metformin 500mg BID to regulate insulin levels and hormonal birth control pills to manage menstrual irregularities. Many women with PCOS struggle with infertility, requiring assisted reproductive technologies like IVF.", "normalised": "one prevalent concern is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (P-C-O-S). characterized by hormonal imbalances, P-C-O-S can manifest in various ways, including irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and acne. diagnosing P-C-O-S often involves blood tests to check hormone levels and ultrasound scans to assess the ovaries. management may include lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as well as medications like Metformin five hundred milligram B-I-D to regulate insulin levels and hormonal birth control pills to manage menstrual irregularities. many women with P-C-O-S struggle with infertility, requiring assisted reproductive technologies like I-V-F."}
{"unnormalised": "Another common condition is endometriosis, where the uterine lining (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This can cause chronic pelvic pain, painful periods (dysmenorrhea), and infertility. Diagnosis often requires a laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Treatment options range from pain management with NSAIDs like Ibuprofen 400mg thrice daily to hormonal therapies and surgery to remove endometrial implants. The prevalence of endometriosis is estimated to be around 1 in 10 women during their reproductive years.", "normalised": "another common condition is endometriosis, where the uterine lining (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. this can cause chronic pelvic pain, painful periods (dysmenorrhea), and infertility. diagnosis often requires a laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure. treatment options range from pain management with N-S-A-I-D-s like Ibuprofen four hundred milligram thrice daily to hormonal therapies and surgery to remove endometrial implants. the prevalence of endometriosis is estimated to be around one in ten women during their reproductive years."}
{"unnormalised": "During pregnancy, several complications can arise. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is a significant concern, particularly in India. Management involves dietary changes, regular exercise, and sometimes insulin injections if blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled. Preeclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of gestation, is another serious complication requiring close monitoring and timely intervention to prevent adverse outcomes for both mother and baby. Regular prenatal checkups are crucial to detect these conditions early. Women are usually advised to begin prenatal care by week 8 of gestation.", "normalised": "during pregnancy, several complications can arise. gestational diabetes mellitus (G-D-M), a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is a significant concern, particularly in India. management involves dietary changes, regular exercise, and sometimes insulin injections if blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled. preeclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine after twenty weeks of gestation, is another serious complication requiring close monitoring and timely intervention to prevent adverse outcomes for both mother and baby. regular prenatal checkups are crucial to detect these conditions early. women are usually advised to begin prenatal care by week eight of gestation."}
{"unnormalised": "Uterine fibroids, non-cancerous growths in the uterus, are also quite common. While some women experience no symptoms, others may suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pain, and frequent urination. Treatment options depend on the size, location, and number of fibroids, as well as the woman's symptoms and reproductive goals. Options include medications to control bleeding, hormonal therapies to shrink fibroids, and surgical procedures like myomectomy (removal of fibroids) or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). A common diagnostic tool is ultrasonography (USG).", "normalised": "uterine fibroids, non-cancerous growths in the uterus, are also quite common. while some women experience no symptoms, others may suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pain, and frequent urination. treatment options depend on the size, location, and number of fibroids, as well as the woman's symptoms and reproductive goals. options include medications to control bleeding, hormonal therapies to shrink fibroids, and surgical procedures like myomectomy (removal of fibroids) or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). a common diagnostic tool is ultrasonography (U-S-G)."}
{"unnormalised": "Cervical cancer screening is vital for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer. The Pap smear test, recommended every 3 years starting at age 21, can detect abnormal cells in the cervix. The HPV (human papillomavirus) test can also be used to screen for high-risk HPV types that can lead to cervical cancer. Vaccination against HPV is highly recommended for young girls and women to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer later in life. Many hospitals like AIIMS offer subsidized screening packages.", "normalised": "cervical cancer screening is vital for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer. the Pap smear test, recommended every three years starting at age twenty one, can detect abnormal cells in the cervix. the H-P-V (human papillomavirus) test can also be used to screen for high-risk H-P-V types that can lead to cervical cancer. vaccination against H-P-V is highly recommended for young girls and women to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer later in life. many hospitals like A-I-I-M-S offer subsidized screening packages."}
{"unnormalised": "Menopause, the cessation of menstruation, typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. It is associated with hormonal changes that can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood swings. Hormone therapy (HT) can help alleviate these symptoms, but it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider. Lifestyle modifications like regular exercise and a healthy diet can also help manage menopausal symptoms. Doctors often prescribe vitamin D supplements to combat bone density loss.", "normalised": "menopause, the cessation of menstruation, typically occurs between the ages of forty five and fifty five. it is associated with hormonal changes that can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood swings. hormone therapy (H-T) can help alleviate these symptoms, but it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider. lifestyle modifications like regular exercise and a healthy diet can also help manage menopausal symptoms. doctors often prescribe vitamin D supplements to combat bone density loss."}
