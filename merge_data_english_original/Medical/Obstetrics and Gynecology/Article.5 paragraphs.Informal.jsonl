{"unnormalised": "Hey ladies! Let’s talk about something super important: our health. Specifically, our reproductive health. Ob-Gyn stuff can seem a bit intimidating, but trust me, understanding the basics is key to staying happy and healthy. I'm not a Dr. or anything, but I've been through the mill, so here’s my take on some common issues we all might face, from that pesky period to the bigger stuff.", "normalised": "Hey ladies!

{"unnormalised": "First up, periods. We all know the drill, but sometimes things go a little haywire. Heavy bleeding (menorrhagia) is super common; like, 1 in 5 women deal with it. Talking to your gynecologist about it is a must. Then there's PMS – those mood swings, bloating, and cravings that hit you a week or so before your period. Simple lifestyle changes like regular exercise and cutting back on caffeine can help a lot with PMS symptoms. My gyno suggested I try evening primrose oil, which has helped some.", "normalised": "First up, periods. We all know the drill, but sometimes things go a little haywire.

{"unnormalised": "Pregnancy is another huge chapter. Morning sickness is almost a rite of passage, right? I remember feeling nauseous 24/7 during my first trimester. If you are planning a pregnancy, consider taking folic acid 400 mcg daily from three months prior to conception until 12 weeks of gestation. And then, there's labour. Natural birth vs. C-section is a huge debate! Both have their pros and cons, so talk to your doctor and figure out what's best for you and your baby. Post-partum care is crucial too. Remember, looking after yourself after the baby arrives is just as important as caring for your little one.", "normalised": "Pregnancy is another huge chapter.

{"unnormalised": "Moving on to other common concerns: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It's a hormonal disorder that affects a lot of women and can cause irregular periods, acne, and difficulty getting pregnant. My cousin, Aisha, was diagnosed with PCOS last year, and she's managing it with diet, exercise, and medication. Then there are UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections). Super annoying and painful! Drink lots of water and cranberry juice to help prevent them. If you get one, see a doc ASAP for antibiotics.", "normalised": "Moving on to other common concerns: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (P-C-O-S).

{"unnormalised": "Finally, let's talk about regular check-ups. Don't skip your annual Pap smear! It’s super important for detecting cervical cancer early. And if you notice anything unusual – like pain, bleeding between periods, or any other changes – don't ignore it. Go see your gyno right away. Early detection is key for so many things. Remember, your health is your wealth! Take care of yourself, ladies! See a gyno near you or at your local hospital. Dr. Iyer at AIIMS is supposed to be really good.", "normalised": "Finally, let's talk about regular check-ups. Don't skip your annual Pap smear!
