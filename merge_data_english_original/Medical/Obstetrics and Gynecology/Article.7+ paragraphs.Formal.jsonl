Regular check-ups with an OBGYN during pregnancy can help identify potential complications early on, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and ectopic pregnancies. In India, where many women live in rural areas with limited access to hospitals, community health workers play a critical role in providing basic prenatal care and referring high-risk pregnancies to specialized centers like AIIMS or Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore.

{"unnormalised": "Childbirth practices vary significantly across India. While institutional deliveries have increased in recent years due to government initiatives like the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), home births remain common in some regions. OBGYNs in urban centers often perform C-sections (Cesarean sections) when medically necessary, although there's ongoing debate about the rising rates of C-sections in private hospitals. Rural health centers rely on skilled birth attendants and midwives to manage normal deliveries and provide emergency obstetric care. Common abbreviations used in documenting labor progress include \"SVD\" (Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery), \"FTND\" (Full Term Normal Delivery) and \"PROM\" (Premature Rupture Of Membranes).", "normalised": "Childbirth practices vary significantly across India.

{"unnormalised": "Gynecological conditions encompass a broad spectrum, from menstrual disorders and infections to uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts. OBGYNs are trained to diagnose and treat these conditions using a variety of methods, including medication, surgery, and minimally invasive procedures. Cervical cancer screening is another crucial aspect of gynecological care. The use of Pap smears and HPV testing helps detect precancerous lesions early, improving the chances of successful treatment. Unfortunately, many Indian women do not have access to regular screening due to financial constraints or lack of awareness. One such screening can cost ~ Rs. 800 at private labs.", "normalised": "Gynecological conditions encompass a broad spectrum, from menstrual disorders and infections to uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts.
