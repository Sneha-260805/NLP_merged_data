The breakthrough involves a novel combination therapy incorporating metformin five hundred milligram twice daily and dietary modifications."}
{"unnormalised": "Dr. Priya Sharma, Head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at AIIMS, presented the findings at a press conference held earlier this morning. The study, which involved 300 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, demonstrated a significant reduction in maternal hyperglycemia and a lower incidence of macrosomia in newborns.", "normalised": "Doctor Priya Sharma, Head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at A-I-I-M-S, presented the findings at a press conference held earlier this morning. The study, which involved three hundred pregnant women diagnosed with G-D-M between twenty four and twenty eight weeks of gestation, demonstrated a significant reduction in maternal hyperglycemia and a lower incidence of macrosomia in newborns."}
{"unnormalised": "\"Our research indicates that this combined approach offers a more effective and safer alternative to insulin therapy in a substantial proportion of GDM cases,\" Dr. Sharma stated. The protocol includes initial dietary counseling, followed by the introduction of metformin if glycemic targets (fasting blood sugar <90 mg/dL and 2-hour postprandial <120 mg/dL) are not achieved within 1 week.", "normalised": "\"Our research indicates that this combined approach offers a more effective and safer alternative to insulin therapy in a substantial proportion of G-D-M cases,\" Doctor Sharma stated.

{"unnormalised": "The study also highlighted the importance of early detection of GDM, advocating for universal screening between 24 and 28 wks of pregnancy. This recommendation aligns with the guidelines issued by the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI). Several patients reported difficulties in accessing affordable glucose monitoring devices. One patient, Mrs. Aisha Khan, noted the high cost of strips at Rs. 25 per strip, stating it impacted her ability to consistently monitor her blood sugar levels at home.", "normalised": "The study also highlighted the importance of early detection of G-D-M, advocating for universal screening between twenty four and twenty eight weeks of pregnancy.

{"unnormalised": "Challenges remain in ensuring widespread adoption of the new protocol, particularly in rural areas where access to specialized obstetric care is limited. AIIMS is collaborating with state health departments to conduct training programs for healthcare providers on the implementation of the GDM management guidelines.

Preliminary data suggests a potential reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in mothers and improved metabolic profiles in offspring.

{"unnormalised": "The findings have been welcomed by healthcare professionals across the country, with many expressing optimism about the potential to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Experts noted that the cost-effectiveness of metformin compared to insulin could make GDM management more accessible to a larger segment of the population, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.", "normalised": "The findings have been welcomed by healthcare professionals across the country, with many expressing optimism about the potential to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.
