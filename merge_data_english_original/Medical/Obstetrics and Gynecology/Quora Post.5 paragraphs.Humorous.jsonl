Apparently, the world of Obstetrics and Gynecology is way more than just waiting for 'the call' (you know which one!). Priya recently went in for a check-up, and the doc was all like, \"Your H-B levels are at ten point five grams per deciliter; we might need to consider iron supplements.” Priya, bless her heart, thought H-B was some kind of trendy new handbag brand.

Apparently, a routine ultrasound costs rupee three thousand at the clinic, and that's just the beginning. She mentioned something about pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, which sounded scarier than trying to parallel park an auto-rickshaw in Mumbai during rush hour. She even used the acronym \"P-C-O-S\" like it was a common household term! My friend was practically hyperventilating."}

That’s more face time than she gets with her own mother! At this rate, she jokes she'll know the receptionist at the hospital better than her own spouse. Don't even get me started on the childbirth class pamphlet. It’s longer than a Bollywood movie and has more acronyms than a tech conference. Someone send help (and maybe chocolate)."}
