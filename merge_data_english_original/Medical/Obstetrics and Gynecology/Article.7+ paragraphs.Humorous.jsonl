{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the fun stuff – prenatal appointments. Expect to pee in a cup approximately every 15 minutes. They're measuring everything from your glucose levels to your protein content, all to ensure your little one is thriving. You'll also be weighed, measured, and poked more times than a voodoo doll. And then there’s the ultrasound. It's like a sneak peek at your future roommate.

The epidural is your best friend, by the way. Embrace it. Love it. Name your firstborn after it. Labour can last anywhere from 4 hours to 24+ hrs, sometimes more for a first-time mum! You may even require a C-section, no biggie, just a tiny little surgical procedure while you are awake. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing!

And if you experience any unusual symptoms – like itching, burning, or green discharge – don't Google it! Just call your OB/GYN. Seriously.
