{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent cardiac issues in India is Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This occurs when plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries, narrowing them and reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Risk factors include high blood pressure (BP), high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease. Symptoms can range from mild chest pain (angina) to a full-blown heart attack (myocardial infarction). According to a study published in the Indian Heart Journal in 2022, nearly 25% of all deaths in India are attributable to CAD.", "normalised": "one of the most prevalent cardiac issues in india is coronary artery disease (C-A-D). this occurs when plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries, narrowing them and reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. risk factors include high blood pressure (B-P), high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease. symptoms can range from mild chest pain (angina) to a full-blown heart attack (myocardial infarction). according to a study published in the indian heart journal in two thousand and twenty two, nearly twenty five percent of all deaths in india are attributable to C-A-D."}
{"unnormalised": "Hypertension, often called \"high BP,\" is another significant concern. Blood pressure readings of 140/90 mmHg or higher are considered hypertensive. Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. Many Indians are unaware they have hypertension, highlighting the need for regular check-ups. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and may require medication such as Amlodipine 5mg, prescribed once daily.", "normalised": "hypertension, often called \"high B-P,\" is another significant concern. blood pressure readings of one hundred and forty divided by ninety M-M H-G or higher are considered hypertensive. uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. many indians are unaware they have hypertension, highlighting the need for regular check-ups. treatment often involves lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and may require medication such as amlodipine five milligram, prescribed once daily."}
{"unnormalised": "Heart failure, a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is also increasingly common. It can result from various underlying heart conditions, including CAD, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles. Diagnosing this early can help prevent it from worsening.", "normalised": "heart failure, a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is also increasingly common. it can result from various underlying heart conditions, including C-A-D, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles. diagnosing this early can help prevent it from worsening."}
{"unnormalised": "Arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, can also pose serious risks. Some arrhythmias are harmless, while others can be life-threatening. Common types include atrial fibrillation (Afib) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Diagnosis typically involves an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and sometimes a Holter monitor to record the heart's electrical activity over 24 hrs.", "normalised": "arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, can also pose serious risks. some arrhythmias are harmless, while others can be life-threatening. common types include atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-T). diagnosis typically involves an electrocardiogram (E-C-G or E-K-G) and sometimes a holter monitor to record the heart's electrical activity over twenty four hours."}
{"unnormalised": "Treatment options in cardiology are diverse and constantly evolving. Lifestyle modifications, including a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fat and sodium, regular physical activity (at least 30 mins of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week), and smoking cessation, are fundamental. Medications play a crucial role in managing many heart conditions. These may include antiplatelet drugs like Aspirin 75mg, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins to lower cholesterol levels.", "normalised": "treatment options in cardiology are diverse and constantly evolving. lifestyle modifications, including a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fat and sodium, regular physical activity (at least thirty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week), and smoking cessation, are fundamental. medications play a crucial role in managing many heart conditions. these may include antiplatelet drugs like aspirin seventy five milligram, beta-blockers, A-C-E inhibitors, and statins to lower cholesterol levels."}
{"unnormalised": "For more severe cases, interventional procedures may be necessary. Angioplasty, a minimally invasive procedure to open blocked coronary arteries, is commonly performed. During angioplasty, a catheter with a balloon tip is inserted into the artery, and the balloon is inflated to widen the narrowed area. A stent, a small mesh tube, is often placed to keep the artery open. Bypass surgery, a more invasive procedure, may be required for patients with multiple blocked arteries. Cost of Angioplasty in a private hospital can range from ₹ 150,000- ₹300,000.", "normalised": "for more severe cases, interventional procedures may be necessary. angioplasty, a minimally invasive procedure to open blocked coronary arteries, is commonly performed. during angioplasty, a catheter with a balloon tip is inserted into the artery, and the balloon is inflated to widen the narrowed area. a stent, a small mesh tube, is often placed to keep the artery open. bypass surgery, a more invasive procedure, may be required for patients with multiple blocked arteries. cost of angioplasty in a private hospital can range from rupee one hundred and fifty thousand to rupee three hundred thousand."}
{"unnormalised": "Prevention is always better than cure. Regular check-ups with a cardiologist, especially for individuals with risk factors, are crucial. Monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight, and adopting a healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. Remember, early detection and timely intervention can save lives. Awareness campaigns like those run on World Heart Day, 29/09 are important in spreading preventative advice.
