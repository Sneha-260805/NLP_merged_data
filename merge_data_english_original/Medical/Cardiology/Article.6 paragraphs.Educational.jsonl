{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent cardiac conditions in India is coronary artery disease (CAD). It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked, often due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). Symptoms can include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and fatigue. Diagnosing CAD typically involves tests like ECG (electrocardiogram), echocardiogram, and angiography. Treatment options range from lifestyle modifications and medications (e.g., statins, beta-blockers) to interventional procedures like angioplasty with stent placement. At hospitals like AIIMS, New Delhi, over 5000 angioplasties are performed annually.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent cardiac conditions in India is coronary artery disease (C-A-D). It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked, often due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). Symptoms can include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and fatigue. Diagnosing C-A-D typically involves tests like E-C-G (electrocardiogram), echocardiogram, and angiography. Treatment options range from lifestyle modifications and medications (e.g., statins, beta-blockers) to interventional procedures like angioplasty with stent placement. At hospitals like A-I-I-M-S, New Delhi, over five thousand angioplasties are performed annually."}
{"unnormalised": "Another common cardiac condition is heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs. Heart failure can result from various underlying causes, including CAD, high blood pressure, and valvular heart disease. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, and fatigue. Diagnosis typically involves echocardiography and blood tests. Treatment involves medications (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors) and lifestyle changes. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be considered, with costs potentially exceeding Rs. 20,00,000.", "normalised": "Another common cardiac condition is heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs.

{"unnormalised": "Cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are also frequently encountered. These can range from harmless palpitations to life-threatening conditions like ventricular fibrillation. Diagnosing arrhythmias typically involves ECG monitoring, sometimes with a Holter monitor worn for 24 hours. Treatment options include medications (e.g., antiarrhythmics), cardioversion, and ablation procedures.", "normalised": "Cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are also frequently encountered. These can range from harmless palpitations to life-threatening conditions like ventricular fibrillation. Diagnosing arrhythmias typically involves E-C-G monitoring, sometimes with a Holter monitor worn for twenty four hours. Treatment options include medications (e.g., antiarrhythmics), cardioversion, and ablation procedures."}
{"unnormalised": "Preventive cardiology plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of heart disease. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), and avoiding smoking, are essential. Regular health check-ups, including blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, are also recommended. For individuals at high risk, medications like aspirin or statins may be prescribed preventively.", "normalised": "Preventive cardiology plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of heart disease. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity (at least one hundred and fifty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), and avoiding smoking, are essential. Regular health check-ups, including blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, are also recommended. For individuals at high risk, medications like aspirin or statins may be prescribed preventively."}
{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, cardiology is a complex and evolving field with significant implications for public health in India. Early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and a focus on prevention are crucial for improving cardiac health outcomes. Consulting a cardiologist, typically holding an MD or DM in Cardiology, for any heart-related concerns is strongly advised. Remember, a healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce your risk of developing heart disease.", "normalised": "In conclusion, cardiology is a complex and evolving field with significant implications for public health in India.
