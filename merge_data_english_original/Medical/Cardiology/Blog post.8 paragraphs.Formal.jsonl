{"unnormalised": "One of the key areas of progress lies in non-invasive cardiac imaging. Techniques such as Cardiac CT scans and Cardiac MRI offer detailed visualization of the heart's structure and function without the need for invasive procedures. For instance, a Cardiac CT Angiography can accurately detect coronary artery disease in its early stages. Such scans can cost anywhere between Rs. 8000 to Rs. 15000 in private hospitals in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. This allows for timely interventions, potentially preventing more serious cardiac events.", "normalised": "One of the key areas of progress lies in non-invasive cardiac imaging. Techniques such as Cardiac C-T scans and Cardiac M-R-I offer detailed visualization of the heart's structure and function without the need for invasive procedures. For instance, a Cardiac C-T Angiography can accurately detect coronary artery disease in its early stages. Such scans can cost anywhere between rupees eight thousand to rupees fifteen thousand in private hospitals in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. This allows for timely interventions, potentially preventing more serious cardiac events."}
{"unnormalised": "Another significant advancement is the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Procedures like Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) offer an alternative to open-heart surgery for patients with severe aortic stenosis. TAVI involves inserting a new valve through a catheter, typically guided through the femoral artery. Several hospitals in India, including AIIMS, are now offering TAVI at a cost starting from ₹20,00,000.", "normalised": "Another significant advancement is the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Several hospitals in India, including A-I-I-M-S, are now offering T-A-V-I at a cost starting from rupee two million."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, there are significant strides in the management of heart failure. New medications, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, have demonstrated impressive results in reducing the risk of hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure. These medications, prescribed by cardiologists like Dr. Rajesh Sharma at Max Hospital, are often used in conjunction with traditional therapies to improve patient outcomes. The typical dosage is 10mg daily.", "normalised": "Furthermore, there are significant strides in the management of heart failure.

The typical dosage is ten milligram daily."}
{"unnormalised": "Remote patient monitoring is also playing an increasingly important role in cardiology. Wearable devices and implantable sensors allow physicians to continuously monitor a patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs. This data can be used to detect early warning signs of cardiac problems and intervene promptly, often preventing emergency situations. Companies like Medtronic are developing advanced monitoring systems.", "normalised": "Remote patient monitoring is also playing an increasingly important role in cardiology.

{"unnormalised": "Genetic testing is also becoming more prevalent in cardiology. Genetic mutations can increase the risk of certain heart conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome. Genetic testing can identify individuals at risk, allowing for proactive management and lifestyle modifications. Labs such as Metropolis offer comprehensive cardiac genetic screening packages from Rs. 10000.", "normalised": "Genetic testing is also becoming more prevalent in cardiology.

{"unnormalised": "Looking ahead, research into regenerative medicine holds immense promise for the future of cardiology. Scientists are exploring ways to repair damaged heart tissue using stem cells and other biological therapies. While still in the early stages, this research could potentially revolutionize the treatment of heart failure and other severe cardiac conditions. Clinical trials are ongoing at institutions such as CMC Vellore.", "normalised": "Looking ahead, research into regenerative medicine holds immense promise for the future of cardiology.
