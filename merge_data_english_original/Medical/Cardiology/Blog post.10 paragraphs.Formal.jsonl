{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent cardiovascular conditions is coronary artery disease (CAD), often resulting from the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This plaque consists of cholesterol, fat, and other substances, obstructing blood flow and potentially leading to angina, heart attacks (MI), or stroke. In India, factors like dietary habits, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic predisposition contribute significantly to the rising incidence of CAD. Managing risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and smoking is paramount in preventing CAD.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent cardiovascular conditions is coronary artery disease (C-A-D), often resulting from the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This plaque consists of cholesterol, fat, and other substances, obstructing blood flow and potentially leading to angina, heart attacks (M-I), or stroke.

{"unnormalised": "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another significant risk factor for heart disease. Readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg warrant medical attention. In India, hypertension often goes undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness and regular check-ups. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management, are essential in controlling hypertension. Medications like ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are often prescribed by cardiologists to manage blood pressure effectively. Dr. Rajesh Sharma at AIIMS, Delhi, often emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in hypertension management.", "normalised": "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another significant risk factor for heart disease.

{"unnormalised": "Heart failure, a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is a serious concern. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles. Heart failure can result from various underlying conditions, including CAD, hypertension, and valve disorders. Management involves medications like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers, along with lifestyle modifications. Patients are often advised to limit fluid intake and sodium consumption. A study conducted by Fortis Hospital in Mumbai showed that early diagnosis and comprehensive management can significantly improve the quality of life for heart failure patients.", "normalised": "Heart failure, a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is a serious concern.

{"unnormalised": "Arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, can range from harmless to life-threatening. Common types include atrial fibrillation (Afib) and ventricular tachycardia. Diagnosis involves an electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor the heart's electrical activity. Treatment options include medications, cardioversion, and ablation procedures. In severe cases, implantable devices like pacemakers or defibrillators may be necessary. A consult with a cardiologist is necessary if palpitations or dizziness is experienced.", "normalised": "Arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, can range from harmless to life-threatening.

{"unnormalised": "Preventive cardiology plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of heart disease. Lifestyle modifications, including a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, are essential. Regular check-ups with a cardiologist can help identify risk factors and detect early signs of heart disease. Lipid profile tests, blood pressure monitoring, and ECGs are commonly used for screening purposes. The Indian Heart Association recommends that individuals above the age of 30 undergo regular heart health screenings.", "normalised": "Preventive cardiology plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of heart disease.

{"unnormalised": "Diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining heart health. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein is recommended. Limiting the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium is crucial. Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fish and flaxseeds can also be beneficial. A traditional Indian diet can be adapted to be heart-healthy by reducing the use of ghee, oil, and processed foods.", "normalised": "Diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining heart health.

{"unnormalised": "Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Activities like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are beneficial. Incorporating strength training exercises can also improve overall fitness and heart health. Consult with a physician before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have underlying health conditions.", "normalised": "Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining cardiovascular health. Aim for at least one hundred and fifty minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or seventy five minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Activities like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are beneficial. Incorporating strength training exercises can also improve overall fitness and heart health. Consult with a physician before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have underlying health conditions."}
{"unnormalised": "Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. Quitting smoking is one of the most effective ways to improve heart health.
