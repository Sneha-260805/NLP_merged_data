{"unnormalised": "Dr. K is recommending angioplasty – a procedure to open up the blocked arteries. He explained it’s like, they insert this tiny balloon thingy and inflate it to push the plaque against the artery walls. Sounds intense! He said the success rate is pretty high, like 90%+, but of course, there are risks, like bleeding or infection. Also, they’ll likely put in a stent to keep the artery open – some kind of metal mesh thingy. Anyone have experience with this?", "normalised": "Doctor K is recommending angioplasty – a procedure to open up the blocked arteries.

Specifically, if anyone has gone through something similar, what were the pros and cons of angioplasty vs. other options (like bypass surgery)? Also, what’s the recovery like?

{"unnormalised": "Also, anyone know anything about the cost involved? AIIMS is usually more affordable than private hospitals, but still, gotta figure out the finances. His health insurance should cover most of it, but I am pretty sure, there will be some out-of-pocket expenses that we will have to deal with like Rs. 20000 or so.
