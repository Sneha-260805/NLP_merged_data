{"unnormalised": "One of the most frequently asked questions I receive is about the symptoms of a heart attack. While chest pain is the classic symptom, it's important to remember that it can manifest differently in individuals. Some may experience discomfort in the left arm, jaw, or back. Shortness of breath, nausea, and lightheadedness are other common signs. Time is of the essence – seeking immediate medical attention, preferably within the \"golden hour,\" can significantly improve outcomes. Call 108 for an ambulance in such situations.", "normalised": "One of the most frequently asked questions I receive is about the symptoms of a heart attack.

{"unnormalised": "Diagnosing heart conditions involves a variety of tests. An ECG (electrocardiogram) is a simple, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create an image of the heart, allowing doctors to assess its structure and function. For more detailed information, a CT scan or MRI of the heart may be ordered. A stress test, often conducted on a treadmill, helps evaluate how the heart functions under physical exertion. Rs. 2500 is approximately the cost for an echocardiogram at many clinics.", "normalised": "Diagnosing heart conditions involves a variety of tests.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment options in cardiology are diverse, ranging from lifestyle modifications to complex surgical procedures. Medications play a crucial role in managing many heart conditions. Statins, for example, help lower cholesterol levels, while ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. For CAD, angioplasty with stent placement is a common procedure to open blocked arteries. CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) surgery may be necessary in more severe cases. My colleague, Dr. Sharma, successfully performed 3 CABG surgeries last week.", "normalised": "Treatment options in cardiology are diverse, ranging from lifestyle modifications to complex surgical procedures.
