{"unnormalised": "So, I went to a cardiologist at Nanavati Hospital. His name was Dr. Sharma, and he was super chill. He did an ECG, which took like, 5 mins, and then he suggested a treadmill test, also known as a TMT. The TMT was scheduled for 2 days later at 10:00 AM. Seriously, running on a treadmill while they stick electrodes all over you is NOT my idea of a fun morning!", "normalised": "So, I went to a cardiologist at Nanavati Hospital.

{"unnormalised": "The result? Well, Dr. Sharma said there was a \"minor abnormality\" on the TMT. He said it could be nothing, but he wants me to get an angiography done to rule out any blockages in my arteries. Angiography! Sounds scary, right?
