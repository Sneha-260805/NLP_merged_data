{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about the basics. Your heart is basically a pump. A really important pump! It's responsible for getting blood, oxygen, and nutrients to every single part of your body. When things go wrong, it can show up in various forms like chest pain (angina), breathlessness or even a heart attack (MI). Trust me, you don't want to experience any of that.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about the basics. Your heart is basically a pump. A really important pump!

{"unnormalised": "Now, what can go wrong? Well, many things, actually. One of the most common issues is coronary artery disease (CAD). This happens when plaque builds up inside your arteries, making it harder for blood to flow. Think of it like the pipes in your house getting clogged. High cholesterol, high BP (blood pressure), smoking – these are all big risk factors. My advice? Ditch the cigarettes, get your cholesterol checked regularly, and keep an eye on that BP!", "normalised": "Now, what can go wrong? Well, many things, actually.

{"unnormalised": "What about treatments? Modern cardiology has come a long way. We have medications, of course. Statins to lower cholesterol, ACE inhibitors for blood pressure. But sometimes, meds aren't enough. That’s where procedures like angioplasty and stenting come in. Angioplasty is basically opening up those clogged arteries with a tiny balloon. A stent is a small mesh tube that keeps the artery open after the balloon is removed. Dr. Sharma at AIIMS Delhi does this procedure very efficiently.", "normalised": "What about treatments?
