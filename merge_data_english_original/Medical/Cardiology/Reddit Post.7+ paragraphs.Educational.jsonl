{"unnormalised": "First off, what exactly *is* cardiology? It’s the branch of medicine dealing with the heart and blood vessels. Cardiologists are the doctors who diagnose and treat all kinds of heart problems. Think of them as the electricians for your ticker! They can perform procedures like angioplasty (clearing blocked arteries) and prescribe meds like statins. It's a complex field, and honestly, Dr. Rajesh Khanna at AIIMS Delhi is probably a much better source than me, haha. But I'll try my best to simplify.", "normalised": "First off, what exactly is cardiology? It’s the branch of medicine dealing with the heart and blood vessels.

{"unnormalised": "Another big one is coronary artery disease (CAD). This is where the arteries that supply blood to your heart become narrowed or blocked, usually due to a buildup of plaque. Symptoms can include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and fatigue. If left untreated, CAD can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction). My uncle's cardiologist explained it like this: imagine your garden hose getting clogged... same idea for your heart. Treatment can range from lifestyle changes and medications (like aspirin 75mg) to procedures like bypass surgery.", "normalised": "Another big one is coronary artery disease (C-A-D).
