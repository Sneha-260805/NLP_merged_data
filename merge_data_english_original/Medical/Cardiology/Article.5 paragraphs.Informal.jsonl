I mean, seriously, look around - everyone's stressed, eating junk, and glued to their phones. Dr. Rajesh Khanna at AIIMS, Delhi, was just telling me that cases of heart disease are climbing, even among the younger crowd. He mentioned something about how high cholesterol levels are becoming a norm. He recommended a yearly checkup for anyone above 30, just to be on the safe side. Plus, he stressed the importance of getting some exercise – even a 30-minute walk can make a huge difference, he said.", "normalised": "Heart health, yaar, it is something we all need to take seriously, especially with our lifestyles these days.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of checkups, my uncle had a pretty scary experience recently. He felt some chest pain and just brushed it off as gas, you know, the usual. But thankfully, my aunt insisted he see a doctor. Turns out, he had a blockage in one of his arteries. He ended up needing an angioplasty. The whole thing cost him around Rs. 2.5 lakh at Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon. Scary stuff! He's all good now, but it was a real wake-up call for the whole family.", "normalised": "Speaking of checkups, my uncle had a pretty scary experience recently.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I'm no doctor, but I've been doing some reading up on this stuff. Apparently, there are different types of heart problems. Some are genetic, some are caused by lifestyle, and some are just plain bad luck. I saw something about \"LVH\" (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) being a risk factor. Also, my friend Priya, who is a nurse, said ECGs (electrocardiograms) are vital for quick detection. Also, I heard that medication like \"Atorvastatin 40mg\" helps in keeping cholesterol under check.", "normalised": "Now, I am no doctor, but I have been doing some reading up on this stuff.

{"unnormalised": "So, what can we do, right? Well, I’m trying to cut down on oily food and maybe even prepone the evening chai to some herbal tea. Small steps, you know? And maybe getting BP checked quarterly will help too. Also, going for a walk for a few days a week can also improve the overall situation, right? I've also started using a fitness tracker to monitor my steps and heart rate. It’s not a magic bullet, but every little bit helps.", "normalised": "So, what can we do, right?
