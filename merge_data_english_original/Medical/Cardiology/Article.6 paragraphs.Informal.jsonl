{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest issues is the rising prevalence of heart attacks, or MIs as they call 'em in the medical world. These things can strike anyone, anytime. I read a report that mentioned a 25% increase in heart attacks among individuals under 40 yrs old. The usual suspects are there – smoking, high cholesterol (anything above 200 mg/dL is risky!), and lack of exercise.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the takeaway? Get regular check-ups, especially if you have a family history of heart disease. Eat healthy (less butter chicken, more veggies!), exercise regularly (even just a brisk walk every day helps!), and manage your stress levels. And hey, if you feel something's not right, don't delay! See a cardiologist ASAP. Your heart will thank you for it!", "normalised": "So, what's the takeaway? Get regular check-ups, especially if you have a family history of heart disease.
