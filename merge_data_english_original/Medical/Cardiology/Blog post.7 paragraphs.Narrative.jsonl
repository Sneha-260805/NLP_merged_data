{"unnormalised": "It was sometime around 10 PM on the 15/8/2023. We were all gathered at home, getting ready for a low-key Independence Day celebration the next day. My father, Rakesh Kumar Sharma, seemed perfectly fine, laughing and joking as usual. He’d just finished his dinner – 2 rotis with dal, his usual. But then, suddenly, he clutched his chest. He said it felt like \"someone was sitting on my chest,\" those were his exact words.", "normalised": "It was sometime around ten P-M on the fifteenth August two thousand and twenty three.

{"unnormalised": "The ER was a blur. A swarm of doctors and nurses surrounded my father. Tests were run, and the tension in the room was palpable. I remember the head cardiologist, Dr. Menon, his brow furrowed as he looked at the ECG results. “It’s a heart attack,” he declared, his voice grave. “We need to prep him for an angioplasty immediately.” The words felt like a punch to the gut. Angioplasty? That sounded incredibly serious. I remember asking Dr. Menon what the success rate was; he mentioned something around 90%, but all I could focus on was the other 10%.", "normalised": "The E-R was a blur.

{"unnormalised": "The next few hours were agonizing. We waited in the hospital waiting room, praying and reciting Hanuman Chalisa. Finally, around 3 AM, Dr. Menon emerged. He looked tired, but he had a reassuring smile. “The angioplasty was successful,” he announced. “We’ve inserted a stent to open up the blocked artery. He’s stable now.” Relief washed over us like a wave. We were allowed to see him briefly in the ICU. He looked pale and weak, but he was alive.", "normalised": "The next few hours were agonizing.

{"unnormalised": "The recovery wasn’t easy. He spent a week in the hospital, followed by months of medication and lifestyle changes. He had to cut down on salt, avoid oily foods (goodbye samosas!), and start exercising regularly. He was prescribed a cocktail of medications, including Aspirin 75mg and Atorvastatin 20mg, which he had to take religiously every day. It was a complete overhaul of his routine.", "normalised": "The recovery wasn’t easy. He spent a week in the hospital, followed by months of medication and lifestyle changes.

{"unnormalised": "My father's experience made me realize that heart problems are real, even for someone who seems as healthy as he did. Now I regularly get my lipid profile checked, and try to be more mindful of my diet. The whole ordeal cost us around Rs. 2.5 lakhs, a considerable amount for a middle-class family, but honestly, his life is priceless. I hope this story serves as a reminder for everyone to take care of their heart, because aisa bhi hota hai.", "normalised": "My father's experience made me realize that heart problems are real, even for someone who seems as healthy as he did.
