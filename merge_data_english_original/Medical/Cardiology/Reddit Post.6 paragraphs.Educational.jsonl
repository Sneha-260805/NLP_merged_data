{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about risk factors. Dr. Kumar at AIIMS Delhi recently gave a talk where he highlighted that things like high stress levels (pretty common in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore), dietary habits heavy on fried foods (think samosas and pakoras), and lack of regular exercise are major contributors to heart disease. He cited a study indicating that individuals with cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mg/dL are at significantly higher risk.", "normalised": "First off, let us talk about risk factors.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of early detection. Many people only realize there's a problem when they experience symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. But often, the damage has already been done. Regular check-ups are key. Dr. Reddy recommends an ECG every 2 years after the age of 40, especially if you have a family history of heart problems.", "normalised": "Then there is the issue of early detection.

{"unnormalised": "Now, about the types of conditions we should be aware of. Conditions like coronary artery disease (CAD), where the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed, are common. Another is hypertension (high blood pressure), often indicated by readings above 140/90 mmHg. Also, remember the importance of understanding terms like \"MI\" (myocardial infarction, a heart attack), and \"angina,\" which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. A report indicated that the incidence of CAD is 2-3 times higher in urban areas compared to rural areas.", "normalised": "Now, about the types of conditions we should be aware of. Conditions like coronary artery disease (C-A-D), where the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed, are common. Another is hypertension (high blood pressure), often indicated by readings above one hundred and forty divided by ninety millimeter mercury. Also, remember the importance of understanding terms like M-I (myocardial infarction, a heart attack), and angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. A report indicated that the incidence of C-A-D is two to three times higher in urban areas compared to rural areas."}
{"unnormalised": "Treatment options have come a long way. Things like angioplasty, where a stent is used to open up blocked arteries, are now relatively common procedures. Some hospitals, such as Fortis Healthcare, also offer advanced treatments like bypass surgery. Medication plays a crucial role too. Statins, for example, are often prescribed to lower cholesterol levels. Beta-blockers can help control heart rate and blood pressure. A consultation with a cardiologist is necessary to determine the best course of action.", "normalised": "Treatment options have come a long way.

Incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats. Get enough sleep. Manage stress through practices like yoga or meditation. Reducing salt intake to less than 6g per day can also help lower blood pressure. Hope this information is helpful!
