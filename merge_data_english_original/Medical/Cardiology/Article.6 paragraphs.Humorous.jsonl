Let's face it, if we don't poke a little fun at this vital organ, we'll all end up with stress-induced tachycardia, which Dr. Sharma down the road (Apollo Hospitals) says is *definitely* not good.

That, my friends, is a classic case of \"acute myocardial infarction waiting to happen.\" Suddenly feeling chest pain after stuffing your face with mithai? Don't Google it! Just call an ambulance and tell them you suspect a possible blockage. They might scoff, but hey, better safe than sorry. The ambulance guys will probably ask for your ECG report.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the lingo! Angioplasty sounds like a fancy gardening term, but it's actually a procedure to unclog those pesky arteries. Cardiomyopathy? Sounds like a really intense yoga pose. And atrial fibrillation? Sounds like a debate tournament for tiny heart chambers. Don't even get me started on CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting). They take a vein from your leg and use it to bypass a blocked artery in your heart. In other words, your leg is donating to your heart fund! How’s that for generosity?", "normalised": "And let's not forget the lingo! Angioplasty sounds like a fancy gardening term, but it's actually a procedure to unclog those pesky arteries.

Cut down on the oily biryani, start walking 30 minutes a day (or at least chase the auto-rickshaw driver for a fair price), and maybe, just maybe, your heart will forgive you for all those late-night chai sessions. If you're a heavy smoker, it is highly advisable to quit. Maybe attend some workshops where they counsel you.", "normalised": "Now, I am no Doctor, but I do know that your heart needs love.
