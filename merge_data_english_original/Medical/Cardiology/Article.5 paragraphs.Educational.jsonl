{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent heart conditions in India is coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become hardened and narrowed due to plaque buildup. Risk factors include high blood pressure (BP), high cholesterol levels (LDL > 130 mg/dL), smoking, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease. Patients often experience chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and fatigue. Diagnosis typically involves an ECG, echocardiogram, and angiography. Treatment options range from lifestyle modifications and medications like statins and beta-blockers to interventional procedures such as angioplasty with stent placement or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A study published in the IJMR (Indian Journal of Medical Research) showed a rising incidence of CAD in the urban population, particularly in individuals aged 40+.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent heart conditions in India is coronary artery disease (C-A-D).

{"unnormalised": "Another significant cardiac condition is heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Symptoms include swelling in the legs and ankles (edema), fatigue, and breathlessness. Common causes of heart failure include CAD, high BP, and valve disorders. Diagnostic tests include echocardiography, which assesses the heart's pumping function (ejection fraction), and blood tests like BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide). Management strategies involve medications such as ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers, as well as lifestyle changes like limiting salt and fluid intake. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be considered. At AIIMS, Dr. Rajesh Kumar specializes in advanced heart failure management.", "normalised": "Another significant cardiac condition is heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

{"unnormalised": "Cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are also common. These can range from harmless palpitations to life-threatening conditions like ventricular tachycardia (VT). An ECG is the primary tool for diagnosing arrhythmias, and treatment depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia. Medications like antiarrhythmics can help control the heart rate, while procedures like ablation can eliminate the source of the arrhythmia. Devices like pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may be necessary for patients with slow heart rates or a high risk of sudden cardiac arrest. The cost of an ICD implantation can range from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh.", "normalised": "Cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are also common.

{"unnormalised": "Prevention is key to managing heart health in India. Regular exercise, a healthy diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol, maintaining a healthy weight (BMI < 25 kg/m²), and avoiding smoking are crucial steps. Regular check-ups with a cardiologist, especially for individuals with risk factors, can help detect and manage heart conditions early. With increasing awareness and access to advanced medical care, India can make significant strides in reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases. Consult your physician if you experience symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Early intervention can significantly improve outcomes.", "normalised": "Prevention is key to managing heart health in India.
