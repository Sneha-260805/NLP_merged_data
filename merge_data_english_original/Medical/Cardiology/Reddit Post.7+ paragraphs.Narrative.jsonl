Dad, Rakesh Kumar, sixty two years old, started complaining of chest pain – not all the time, but definitely after his evening walks. He's usually quite active, so this was unusual. Mom kept telling him to go see a Doctor, but you know how dads are. He brushed it off as gas or something."}

They rushed him to Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon. The diagnosis? Acute myocardial infarction – a heart attack. I remember the doctor saying it was likely due to blocked arteries. He mentioned something about L-D-L cholesterol being at one hundred and eighty milligram per deciliter. Scared the living daylights out of all of us."}

We're making sure he gets regular check-ups now, and we’re all trying to be more health-conscious. It made me realise how important it is to take cardiac symptoms seriously. If you ever experience chest pain, don't delay - see a Doctor A-S-A-P. Also, prepone your parents checkup by six months. Take care, everyone!"}
