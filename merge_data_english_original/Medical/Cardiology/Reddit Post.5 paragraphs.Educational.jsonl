You see ads all the time for Dr. Batra's Homeopathy claiming they can cure everything, but for serious conditions like valve prolapse or a triple vessel blockage, please, see a proper cardiologist at a reputable hospital. Hospitals like AIIMS Delhi or Fortis are known for their cardiology departments. Don't fall for quick fixes. Prevention is key.", "normalised": "First off, heart disease is a huge problem here.
