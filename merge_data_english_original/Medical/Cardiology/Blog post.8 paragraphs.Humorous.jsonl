{"unnormalised": "It all started subtly. A bit of breathlessness after a particularly vigorous chai-drinking session. A mild chest pain that I initially dismissed as indigestion from my mother-in-law’s notoriously spicy biryani. But then came the palpitations. Not the cute, \"oh, he's so dreamy\" kind. More like the \"is this what a heart attack feels like?\" kind. So, naturally, I googled my symptoms. Bad move. Dr. Google diagnosed me with everything from a mild arrhythmia to impending doom.

She did, however, raise an eyebrow at my insistence that my heart was trying to learn the bhangra. After a barrage of tests (EKG, ECG, stress test – the works!), she declared that I was, in fact, not dying. Just…slightly out of shape.
