{"unnormalised": "Cardiology, the branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the heart, has seen significant advancements in India. However, unnormalized data related to cardiac care presents challenges for efficient data processing and analysis. This article aims to highlight some of the key areas where normalization is crucial, particularly in the context of Indian healthcare. Consider, for instance, variations in recording blood pressure (BP) readings, such as 120/80 mmHg vs. 120/80. Standardizing these is vital for accurate diagnosis and treatment.", "normalised": "cardiology, the branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the heart, has seen significant advancements in india. however, unnormalized data related to cardiac care presents challenges for efficient data processing and analysis. this article aims to highlight some of the key areas where normalization is crucial, particularly in the context of indian healthcare. consider, for instance, variations in recording blood pressure (B-P) readings, such as one hundred and twenty divided by eighty millimeter mercury versus one hundred and twenty divided by eighty. standardizing these is vital for accurate diagnosis and treatment."}
{"unnormalised": "One significant issue is the inconsistent use of abbreviations and acronyms in medical records. For example, \"CAD\" could refer to coronary artery disease, but this needs to be clearly specified. Similarly, medication dosages are often recorded in abbreviated forms, such as \"25mg\" instead of \"twenty-five milligrams,\" or even in local prescriptions written with regional abbreviations. Further, varied spellings of similar terms such as ECG and EKG make it hard to compare information across records. Standardizing these across hospitals like AIIMS and CMC Vellore is of utmost importance.", "normalised": "one significant issue is the inconsistent use of abbreviations and acronyms in medical records. for example, \"C-A-D\" could refer to coronary artery disease, but this needs to be clearly specified. similarly, medication dosages are often recorded in abbreviated forms, such as twenty five milligram instead of \"twenty-five milligrams,\" or even in local prescriptions written with regional abbreviations. further, varied spellings of similar terms such as E-C-G and E-K-G make it hard to compare information across records. standardizing these across hospitals like A-I-I-M-S and C-M-C vellore is of utmost importance."}
{"unnormalised": "Another area requiring normalization is the representation of numerical data. Cardiac risk scores, lab values (e.g., cholesterol levels), and mortality rates are often presented in diverse formats. Numbers like “1,00,000” (one lakh) need to be converted to a standard numeric representation for analytical purposes. Variations in displaying dates (e.g., \"10/10/2024\" vs. \"Oct 10, 2024\") also complicate data aggregation. The time of cardiac events or medication administration, often recorded as \"9:00AM\" or \"0900 hrs,\" must be standardized as well.", "normalised": "another area requiring normalization is the representation of numerical data. cardiac risk scores, lab values (e.g., cholesterol levels), and mortality rates are often presented in diverse formats. numbers like \"one hundred thousand\" (one lakh) need to be converted to a standard numeric representation for analytical purposes. variations in displaying dates (e.g., tenth october two thousand and twenty four versus october tenth, two thousand and twenty four) also complicate data aggregation. the time of cardiac events or medication administration, often recorded as \"nine AM\" or \"zero nine hundred hours,\" must be standardized as well."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, demographic data, though seemingly straightforward, can present normalization challenges in India. Names are recorded with variations and honorifics (e.g., \"Mr. Sharma,\" \"Dr. Khan\"). Age is sometimes documented as “60 yrs” or simply \"60\", making it difficult to compute aggregate statistics accurately. Even location data, referencing cities like Mumbai or Chennai, requires geocoding and standardization for mapping disease prevalence and healthcare access. Consider a case where patient R. Kumar's diagnosis requires merging with statistical census data, inconsistencies would make this difficult.", "normalised": "furthermore, demographic data, though seemingly straightforward, can present normalization challenges in india. names are recorded with variations and honorifics (e.g., \"mister sharma,\" \"doctor khan\"). age is sometimes documented as \"sixty years\" or simply \"sixty\", making it difficult to compute aggregate statistics accurately. even location data, referencing cities like mumbai or chennai, requires geocoding and standardization for mapping disease prevalence and healthcare access. consider a case where patient R. kumar's diagnosis requires merging with statistical census data, inconsistencies would make this difficult."}
{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, the normalization of cardiology-related data is essential for improving healthcare quality, research, and public health initiatives in India. Standardizing medical terminologies, numerical data, and demographic information will facilitate more accurate analysis, better decision-making, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The adoption of standardized data formats across all healthcare institutions, from private clinics to major hospitals like Apollo Hospital, is a crucial step toward realizing these benefits.", "normalised": "in conclusion, the normalization of cardiology-related data is essential for improving healthcare quality, research, and public health initiatives in india. standardizing medical terminologies, numerical data, and demographic information will facilitate more accurate analysis, better decision-making, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes. the adoption of standardized data formats across all healthcare institutions, from private clinics to major hospitals like apollo hospital, is a crucial step toward realizing these benefits."}
