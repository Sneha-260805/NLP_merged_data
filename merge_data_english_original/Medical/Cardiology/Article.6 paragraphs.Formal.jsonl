{"unnormalised": "Cardiology, the branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the heart and the circulatory system, faces unique challenges in India, where cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality. Factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic disparities contribute to the high prevalence of conditions like coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and arrhythmias. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including early detection, effective treatment strategies, and preventive measures tailored to the Indian context.", "normalised": "Cardiology, the branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the heart and the circulatory system, faces unique challenges in India, where cardiovascular diseases (C-V-D-s) are a leading cause of mortality.

{"unnormalised": "Diagnostic procedures in cardiology have advanced significantly. An ECG, costing approximately Rs. 500 at local clinics, remains a vital tool for initial assessment. Echocardiography, priced around Rs. 3000-5000, provides detailed structural and functional information about the heart. For more complex cases, cardiac catheterization, often performed at institutions like AIIMS, New Delhi, allows for direct visualization of coronary arteries. Newer techniques like cardiac MRI are gaining prominence, although they remain relatively expensive.", "normalised": "Diagnostic procedures in cardiology have advanced significantly. An E-C-G, costing approximately rupee five hundred at local clinics, remains a vital tool for initial assessment.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment options for CVDs are diverse and depend on the specific condition. For CAD, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as angioplasty, involves inserting a stent to open blocked arteries. Dr. Rajesh Sharma, a renowned cardiologist at Fortis Hospital, explains that stents cost between Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 1,50,000 depending on the type. Bypass surgery, another option, involves grafting healthy blood vessels to circumvent blocked arteries. Medication also plays a crucial role, with drugs like statins and beta-blockers being commonly prescribed.", "normalised": "Treatment options for C-V-D-s are diverse and depend on the specific condition.

{"unnormalised": "Heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, requires a comprehensive management strategy. Medications such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics are used to reduce symptoms and improve heart function. In severe cases, implantable devices like pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may be necessary. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is another option for patients with specific types of heart failure. A consultation with a cardiologist like Dr. Aisha Khan at Apollo Hospitals can help determine the most suitable treatment plan.", "normalised": "Heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, requires a comprehensive management strategy.

{"unnormalised": "Prevention is key to mitigating the burden of CVDs in India. Lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, are essential. Public health initiatives aimed at promoting awareness about risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol are crucial. Regular check-ups, especially for individuals with a family history of heart disease, are recommended. A basic health screening package, including lipid profile and blood sugar tests, may cost around Rs. 1500 at diagnostic centers.", "normalised": "Prevention is key to mitigating the burden of C-V-D-s in India.
