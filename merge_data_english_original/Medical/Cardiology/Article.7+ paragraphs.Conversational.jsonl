An ECG is like a snapshot of your heart's electrical activity, while an Angiogram is more like a detailed map of your blood vessels using dye and X-rays. My grandpa had both done, at Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai. The bill was around Rs. 35000 for the Angiogram, if I recall correctly.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about the lingo.
