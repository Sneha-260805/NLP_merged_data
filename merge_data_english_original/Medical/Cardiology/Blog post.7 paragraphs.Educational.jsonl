{"unnormalised": "First, let's understand what cardiology is all about. Cardiology is the branch of medicine dealing with the heart and blood vessels. Cardiologists like Dr. Rajesh Khanna at Max Hospital, Delhi, specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions like heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and congenital heart defects. Common procedures include ECGs (electrocardiograms), echocardiograms (often called \"echo's\"), and angiograms. A routine checkup might include a BP reading (blood pressure), which should ideally be around 120/80 mmHg.", "normalised": "First, let's understand what cardiology is all about.

If your LDL cholesterol is consistently above 130 mg/dL, lifestyle changes and possibly medication may be necessary. Another common risk factor is hypertension (high blood pressure). Keeping your weight in check (BMI below 25 kg/m2) and engaging in regular physical activity are crucial in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels.", "normalised": "One of the key risk factors for heart disease is high cholesterol.

{"unnormalised": "Diet plays a huge role. Traditional Indian diets can be heavy on saturated fats and refined carbohydrates, which can contribute to plaque buildup in arteries. Try to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your meals. Limit your intake of ghee, butter, and fried foods like samosas and pakoras. Consider consulting a registered dietitian for personalized dietary advice; a simple change such as using olive oil instead of vegetable oil in daily cooking can improve health parameters by 10-15 %.", "normalised": "Diet plays a huge role.

{"unnormalised": "Exercise is equally important. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a significant difference. Yoga and meditation can also help reduce stress, which is another risk factor for heart disease. Remember to always consult your doc before beginning an intense exercise regime, esp. if you have had any cardio-vascular issues in the past.", "normalised": "Exercise is equally important.

{"unnormalised": "Smoking is an absolute no-no. It damages blood vessels and increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your heart health, regardless of how long you've been smoking. Support groups and nicotine replacement therapy can be helpful in quitting smoking. Seek professional help, if needed. A person who has been smoking 10 cigs a day for the past 15 years can expect to see improvements within a year of quitting.", "normalised": "Smoking is an absolute no-no.

Early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes and prevent serious complications. Don't ignore symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
