{"unnormalised": "One of the most common procedures performed by interventional cardiologists is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as angioplasty. PCI involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel, typically in the arm or groin, and guiding it to the blocked or narrowed coronary artery. A balloon is then inflated to open the artery, and a stent, a small metal mesh tube, is deployed to keep the artery open. Drug-eluting stents (DES) are now the standard of care, releasing medication to prevent restenosis, the re-narrowing of the artery. Studies have shown that DES reduce the risk of repeat procedures by up to 70% compared to bare-metal stents. In India, Dr. Devi Shetty's Narayana Hrudayalaya hospitals are renowned for their high volume of PCI procedures and commitment to affordable cardiac care.", "normalised": "One of the most common procedures performed by interventional cardiologists is percutaneous coronary intervention (P-C-I), also known as angioplasty.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond PCI, interventional cardiology encompasses a range of other procedures. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for patients with severe aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the aortic valve. TAVR involves inserting a replacement valve through a catheter and deploying it within the diseased valve. TAVR is particularly beneficial for elderly or high-risk patients who are not suitable candidates for traditional surgery. According to a report in \"The Hindu\" dated 12/05/2023, TAVR procedures are becoming increasingly common in major Indian cities like Mumbai and Delhi.", "normalised": "Beyond P-C-I, interventional cardiology encompasses a range of other procedures.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of advancement is in the treatment of structural heart disease. Procedures such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure are now routinely performed using catheter-based techniques. These procedures involve inserting a device through a catheter to close the abnormal opening in the heart. Similarly, percutaneous mitral valve repair, using devices like the MitraClip, offers a less invasive option for patients with mitral regurgitation, a condition in which the mitral valve leaks. AIIMS, New Delhi has been a pioneer in adopting these techniques in India.", "normalised": "Another area of advancement is in the treatment of structural heart disease.

{"unnormalised": "Intravascular imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), play a crucial role in guiding interventional procedures. IVUS uses ultrasound to visualize the inside of the coronary arteries, providing detailed information about plaque composition and vessel dimensions. OCT uses light to create high-resolution images of the arterial wall. These imaging modalities help cardiologists to optimize stent placement and ensure complete lesion coverage. Data suggests that the use of IVUS can reduce stent thrombosis by approximately 40%.", "normalised": "Intravascular imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound (I-V-U-S) and optical coherence tomography (O-C-T), play a crucial role in guiding interventional procedures.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is transforming interventional cardiology. AI-powered algorithms can analyze angiograms and other imaging data to identify areas of stenosis and predict the risk of future cardiac events. ML models can also be used to personalize treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics. A recent study published in the \"Indian Heart Journal\" on 20/07/2024 showcased how AI improved the accuracy of lesion detection by 25%.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (A-I) and machine learning (M-L) is transforming interventional cardiology.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the remarkable advancements, challenges remain. Access to advanced interventional cardiology services is still limited in rural areas of India. The cost of procedures and devices can also be a barrier for many patients. However, government initiatives and philanthropic organizations are working to improve access and affordability. For instance, the \"Ayushman Bharat\" scheme provides financial assistance for cardiac procedures to eligible individuals. As of Q3 2023, over 10,000 patients have benefitted from this scheme for cardiac treatments in the state of Tamil Nadu alone.", "normalised": "Despite the remarkable advancements, challenges remain.
