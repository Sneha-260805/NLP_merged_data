He’s 75 yrs old, you know, and we always knew his cholesterol was a bit high, like around 240 mg/dL according to his last check-up.

{"unnormalised": "Turns out, it *was* a heart attack. The docs, especially Dr. Sharma, were super quick. They did an ECG right away and confirmed it. They said one of his arteries was blocked – I think they called it a “STEMI” or something? He had to get an angioplasty done ASAP. The doc kept saying “golden hour” and all, so we were all panicking. The whole procedure cost around Rs. 2.5 lakh, thankfully we had health insurance.", "normalised": "Turns out, it was a heart attack. The docs, especially Doctor Sharma, were super quick.

{"unnormalised": "The good news is, the angioplasty went well. They put in a stent, a small one, around 3mm I think. Nana ji is recovering now, but Dr. Sharma has put him on a bunch of meds: aspirin 75mg, statins, and something for his blood pressure, probably an ACE inhibitor. He’s also been told to seriously change his diet – no more ghee-laden parathas, poor guy!", "normalised": "The good news is, the angioplasty went well.
