{"unnormalised": "One of the most common reasons people visit a cardiologist is for chest pain, often described as angina. Angina can be a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), where plaque buildup narrows the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Other frequent concerns include shortness of breath, palpitations (a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart), and unexplained fatigue. Symptoms like these warrant a visit to Dr. Rajesh Khanna at Max Hospital, Saket, for a thorough evaluation.", "normalised": "One of the most common reasons people visit a cardiologist is for chest pain, often described as angina.

{"unnormalised": "Cardiologists employ a variety of diagnostic tools to assess heart health. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) records the electrical activity of the heart and can detect abnormalities like arrhythmias or signs of a previous heart attack. An echocardiogram uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart, allowing doctors to visualize its structure and function. Stress tests, which involve monitoring the heart during exercise, can help identify blockages in the coronary arteries. A common treatment option for blocked arteries is Angioplasty, which costs around Rs. 2,50,000 at a reputed hospital.", "normalised": "Cardiologists employ a variety of diagnostic tools to assess heart health.

{"unnormalised": "Common conditions treated in cardiology include hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), valvular heart disease (problems with the heart valves), and congenital heart defects (birth defects affecting the heart's structure). Each of these conditions requires a tailored treatment approach, ranging from lifestyle modifications and medications to more invasive procedures.", "normalised": "Common conditions treated in cardiology include hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), valvular heart disease (problems with the heart valves), and congenital heart defects (birth defects affecting the heart's structure).

{"unnormalised": "Medications play a crucial role in managing many cardiac conditions. ACE inhibitors are often prescribed for hypertension and heart failure, while beta-blockers can help slow heart rate and reduce blood pressure. Statins are used to lower cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries. Antiplatelet drugs, like aspirin 75mg, prevent blood clots from forming. It's crucial to take medications as prescribed by your cardiologist and to understand their potential side effects.", "normalised": "Medications play a crucial role in managing many cardiac conditions.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond medications, lifestyle changes are paramount for maintaining heart health. A heart-healthy diet, low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, is essential. Regular physical activity, such as walking for 30 minutes most days of the week, strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your heart, as smoking damages blood vessels and increases the risk of blood clots.", "normalised": "Beyond medications, lifestyle changes are paramount for maintaining heart health.

{"unnormalised": "For more severe heart conditions, interventional procedures may be necessary. Angioplasty, as mentioned earlier, involves inserting a catheter with a balloon to widen narrowed arteries. Stenting, which involves placing a small mesh tube in the artery to keep it open after angioplasty, is often performed concurrently. In some cases, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery may be required to reroute blood flow around blocked arteries. A CABG surgery can cost anywhere from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh depending on the hospital and the complexity of the procedure.", "normalised": "For more severe heart conditions, interventional procedures may be necessary.

{"unnormalised": "Prevention is always better than cure. Regular check-ups with your primary care physician or a cardiologist, especially if you have risk factors for heart disease (e.g., family history, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes), are crucial for early detection and intervention.
