{"unnormalised": "It all started, innocently enough, with a routine check-up. Dr. Sharma, bless her cotton saree, suggested an ECG. Now, I’m no medical expert, but I envisioned something akin to a Bollywood dance number: lots of synchronized movements and maybe some dramatic lighting. What I got was sticky pads and a machine that beeped like a dial-up modem. The result? Let's just say my ECG looked less like a Bhangra routine and more like a squirrel had been tap-dancing on the sensor.", "normalised": "It all started, innocently enough, with a routine check-up.

{"unnormalised": "Thus began my adventure into the world of cardiology. First stop: dietary changes. I attempted to embrace the healthy life. I really did. I swapped my samosas for salads, my chai for…well, okay, I couldn't give up chai. Baby steps, people! But let me tell you, finding a decent, heart-healthy Indian meal is harder than finding a rickshaw driver who uses his meter.", "normalised": "Thus began my adventure into the world of cardiology.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the dreaded \"E\" word: exercise. Me? Exercise? The same person who considers walking from the couch to the fridge a marathon?

I was practically a snail on a mission.", "normalised": "Then came the dreaded \"E\" word: exercise. Me? Exercise? The same person who considers walking from the couch to the fridge a marathon?

{"unnormalised": "My cardiologist also suggested a stress test. Picture this: me, on a treadmill, trying to keep up while they monitor my heart. It felt like I was auditioning for a low-budget action movie. The nurse, bless her soul, kept shouting encouragement, but all I could think about was the plate of biryani I was missing. My BP apparently shot up to 180/100 during this ordeal, and the doctor looked concerned.", "normalised": "My cardiologist also suggested a stress test.

It’s the only one you’ve got (unless you’re planning on getting a transplant, which, let’s be honest, sounds like a plot for a very intense medical drama). Listen to your doctor, eat your greens, and maybe lay off the extra ghee in your dal. Your heart will thank you for it.
