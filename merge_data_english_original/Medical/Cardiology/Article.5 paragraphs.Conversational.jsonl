{"unnormalised": "One of the big things cardiologists deal with is heart disease. This can manifest in many ways, from high BP (mentioned earlier) to more serious stuff like heart attacks (Myocardial Infarction, or MI) and strokes. Understanding your cholesterol levels is also crucial. You've probably heard of LDL and HDL – the \"bad\" and \"good\" cholesterol, respectively. A simple blood test at your local diagnostic centre, maybe costing around Rs. 500, can give you these numbers. My uncle had a scare last year; his LDL was over 160 mg/dL.", "normalised": "One of the big things cardiologists deal with is heart disease.

You don't need to run a marathon; even a brisk walk for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, can make a big difference. My cousin, Priya, swears by her yoga sessions at 7 AM every morning. Also, if you're a smoker, quit! It's the absolute worst thing for your heart.", "normalised": "So, what can you do? Well, lifestyle changes are key.
