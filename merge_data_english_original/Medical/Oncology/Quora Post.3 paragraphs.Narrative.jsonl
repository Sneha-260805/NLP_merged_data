We used to travel from our village near Patna, Bihar to Mumbai every 3 weeks for her treatment. The doctors, especially Dr. Iyer, were so supportive. They explained everything patiently, including the option of palliative care if things didn't go as planned, although thankfully, that never became necessary.
