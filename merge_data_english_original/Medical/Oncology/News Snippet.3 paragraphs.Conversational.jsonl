Early detection and timely treatment are key to improving survival rates. For instance, a patient with Stage 1 breast cancer has a significantly better prognosis than someone diagnosed at Stage 4. Even something as simple as a mammogram, costing approximately Rs. 2500, can make a huge difference.”", "normalised": "\"We are committed to providing the best possible care,\" said Doctor Sharma, head of oncology at A-I-I-M-S. \"This initiative is a step towards ensuring that everyone, regardless of their location, has access to timely and quality cancer treatment.
