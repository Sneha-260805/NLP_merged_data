Oncology, in simple terms, is the branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It covers a HUGE range of diseases, from relatively common ones like breast cancer to rarer forms. Treatment options are also varied and depend heavily on the type and stage of cancer. You'll often hear terms like \"chemo,\" \"radiation,\" and \"immunotherapy.\" Understanding these basics can be really helpful when you're trying to navigate complex medical information.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some info about oncology, since I've seen a lot of confusion online.

{"unnormalised": "One common misconception is that all cancers are death sentences. While cancer is a serious illness, advancements in treatment have significantly improved survival rates for many types. For example, early detection of breast cancer through mammograms can lead to much better outcomes. Doctors often use the TNM staging system (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) to describe the extent of the cancer's spread. A stage 1 diagnosis generally has a better prognosis than a stage 4 diagnosis. Also, the hospital you choose can make a difference; places like Tata Memorial Hospital are known for their oncology departments.", "normalised": "One common misconception is that all cancers are death sentences.
