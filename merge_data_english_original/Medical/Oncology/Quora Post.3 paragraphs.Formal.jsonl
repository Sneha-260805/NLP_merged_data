{"unnormalised": "Recent advances in oncology in India mirror global trends, with some adaptations for the local context. Personalized medicine is gaining traction, with genetic testing like BRCA1/2 analysis becoming more common, especially for breast cancer. Targeted therapies, such as EGFR inhibitors for lung cancer, are being increasingly used based on molecular profiling. Several hospitals, including Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai and AIIMS Delhi, are actively involved in clinical trials for novel therapies. Expect to see more use of liquid biopsies for early cancer detection, though the cost at Rs. 20,000-30,000 per test remains a barrier for many.", "normalised": "Recent advances in oncology in India mirror global trends, with some adaptations for the local context.

{"unnormalised": "Immunotherapy is another area of significant progress. Drugs like pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are now approved for a wider range of cancers, but the high cost (approx. Rs. 2.5 lakhs per dose) limits accessibility. Several Indian companies are working on biosimilars to reduce the cost. Minimally invasive surgical techniques, including robotic surgery, are becoming more prevalent in major cancer centers like Apollo Hospitals in Chennai. The use of advanced radiation techniques, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), is also on the rise. The National Cancer Grid, supported by the Govt. of India, facilitates collaborative research & treatment protocols.", "normalised": "Immunotherapy is another area of significant progress.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, supportive care is receiving greater attention. Palliative care services are expanding, aiming to improve the quality of life for cancer patients. Initiatives are being undertaken to address the psychosocial needs of patients and their families. While there is a growing need for trained oncologists and nurses, institutions are slowly but steadily increasing their capacity. Early detection campaigns, particularly for common cancers like breast and cervical cancer, are crucial, though reaching rural populations remains a challenge.", "normalised": "Finally, supportive care is receiving greater attention.
