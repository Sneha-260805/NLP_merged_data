Initially, we were super confused about where to go. Finally, we consulted Dr. Rajesh at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. He suggested a combination of chemo and radiation therapy. The whole process was quite grueling, but thankfully, she's doing much better now. It cost us around ₹5,00,000 for the initial treatment phase, excluding meds.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about cancer treatment options in India, so thought I would share some insights.
