Just last month, Dr. Sharma at AIIMS Delhi presented some amazing data on a new immunotherapy treatment for Stage III lung cancer. Apparently, the survival rate jumped by like 15% compared to the standard chemo. That's HUGE, right? They're also doing some really cool research on gene editing to target specific cancer cells.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about recent advances in oncology here.

{"unnormalised": "Another promising area is early detection. There's this blood test, I think it's called \"CancerDetect\" or something similar, that claims to be able to detect multiple types of cancer at Stage 1. I saw a report on NDTV about it a few weeks back; apparently, it’s costing around Rs. 25,000 for the test. Still early days, of course, but imagine catching cancer before it even has a chance to spread! They are running trials at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai currently.", "normalised": "Another promising area is early detection.

Doctors are now able to analyze a patient's tumor DNA and tailor treatment specifically to the unique genetic makeup of their cancer. My neighbor’s uncle was diagnosed with prostate cancer in Dec ‘22 and his doctor used this approach. He's doing much better now, touch wood! Seriously though, oncology is an exciting field right now. There is so much going on and with all the latest research, it gives us hope for curing and treating cancer better.", "normalised": "And personalized medicine is becoming a big thing.
