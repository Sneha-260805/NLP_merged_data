{"unnormalised": "India has seen considerable progress in oncology in recent years. Advancements include more precise diagnostic tools and treatment modalities. For instance, PET scans are now more widely available, helping in early detection. Regarding treatment, targeted therapies are becoming increasingly common; for example, drugs like Imatinib for CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) have significantly improved patient outcomes. Many patients now consult with oncologists at hospitals such as Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai for these newer therapies.", "normalised": "India has seen considerable progress in oncology in recent years.

{"unnormalised": "Surgical techniques have also evolved. Minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) are now standard practice in many cases, leading to quicker recovery times. Radiation therapy has also seen advancements, with techniques like IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy) allowing for more precise targeting of tumors while sparing healthy tissue. Patients are often prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy based on protocols established by institutions like AIIMS, New Delhi, typically lasting for a period of 6 months.", "normalised": "Surgical techniques have also evolved.

{"unnormalised": "The cost of cancer treatment remains a significant concern. While government schemes like Ayushman Bharat provide some relief, the expenses can still be substantial, often reaching ₹5,00,000 or more for comprehensive treatment plans. Many NGOs are working to provide financial assistance to patients. The accessibility of advanced treatment also varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with major metropolitan areas having better access to specialized care such as stem cell transplants.", "normalised": "The cost of cancer treatment remains a significant concern. While government schemes like Ayushman Bharat provide some relief, the expenses can still be substantial, often reaching rupee five hundred thousand or more for comprehensive treatment plans.

{"unnormalised": "Ongoing research is crucial. Indian researchers are actively involved in clinical trials evaluating new drugs and treatment strategies. For instance, studies are underway to explore the potential of immunotherapy in various cancers, including lung and breast cancer. With continued investment in research and infrastructure, India is poised to make further strides in improving cancer care and patient outcomes, with many trials projected to release initial data by Q3 2025.", "normalised": "Ongoing research is crucial.
