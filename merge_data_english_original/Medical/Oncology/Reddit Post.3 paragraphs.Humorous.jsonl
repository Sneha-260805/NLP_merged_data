If anyone's got tips on dealing with chemo fatigue or where to find good quality wigs (Asking for a friend… okay, maybe for Sharma ji), hit me up! Also, pro-tip: always double-check the dosage. They almost gave him 1000mg of something instead of 500mg! Almost gave the man super-powers, or maybe just a really bad stomach ache.
