{"unnormalised": "Well, there have been some pretty significant strides in oncology in India recently. For instance, targeted therapy is becoming more accessible. Dr. Rajesh Kumar at Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai has been using it extensively for lung cancer patients, showing good results. Think drugs like EGFR inhibitors for specific mutations. Also, immunotherapy is gaining traction. We're seeing oncologists at AIIMS Delhi prescribing drugs like Pembrolizumab for certain types of melanoma, which has improved survival rates. These aren’t your traditional chemo; they boost your immune system to fight the cancer.", "normalised": "Well, there have been some pretty significant strides in oncology in India recently.

{"unnormalised": "Another area of progress is in diagnostics. Early detection is key, right? So, advanced imaging techniques like PET-CT scans are becoming more widely available, even in smaller cities. This allows for more accurate staging of the disease. Plus, liquid biopsies are being researched to detect circulating tumor cells, which could potentially identify cancer early on from a simple blood test. Some hospitals are even offering genetic testing to assess individual cancer risk. A full body checkup package can cost Rs. 10,000-15,000 depending on the tests included.", "normalised": "Another area of progress is in diagnostics. Early detection is key, right?

There are also NGOs like the Indian Cancer Society working to support patients and raise awareness. Of course, there are still challenges, like infrastructure gaps and cost barriers. But, things are definitely moving in the right direction. Remember to consult with a qualified oncologist for any medical advice!", "normalised": "Finally, access to care is slowly improving.
