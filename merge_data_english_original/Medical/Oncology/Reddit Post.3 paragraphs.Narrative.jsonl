Initially, we thought it was just stress from work – he's a retired govt. employee and still takes on consultancy gigs. But then he started having these terrible stomach cramps, so we took him to Dr. Sharma at Max Hospital.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share my dad’s journey with cancer.

{"unnormalised": "After a bunch of tests, including a CT scan and a biopsy, he was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer. It was a shock to all of us. The doc recommended immediate treatment – a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. They suggested 6 cycles of FOLFOX. The cost was a big worry, around Rs. 5,00,000 for the whole treatment. We had some insurance, but still had to dip into our savings.
