A new study published on 20/07/2024 shows promising results for a novel immunotherapy drug targeting specific types of lung cancer. Dr. Rajesh Kumar, head of the Oncology department, stated that the drug, currently codenamed 'OncoHope-23', demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor size in 75% of patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial.", "normalised": "A-I-I-M-S Delhi reports breakthrough in cancer treatment! A new study published on twentieth july two thousand and twenty four shows promising results for a novel immunotherapy drug targeting specific types of lung cancer. Doctor Rajesh Kumar, head of the Oncology department, stated that the drug, currently codenamed 'OncoHope-twenty three', demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor size in seventy five percent of patients in the Phase two clinical trial."}
{"unnormalised": "The study, involving 120 patients with stage 3B and stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, was conducted over a period of 18 months. Participants received OncoHope-23 in combination with standard chemotherapy. Results indicated a median progression-free survival of 14 months, compared to 8 months for patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, side effects were reported to be manageable, primarily consisting of fatigue and mild nausea in approximately 20% of cases.", "normalised": "The study, involving one hundred and twenty patients with stage three B and stage four non-small cell lung cancer, was conducted over a period of eighteen months. Participants received OncoHope-twenty three in combination with standard chemotherapy. Results indicated a median progression-free survival of fourteen months, compared to eight months for patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, side effects were reported to be manageable, primarily consisting of fatigue and mild nausea in approximately twenty percent of cases."}
{"unnormalised": "This research highlights the potential of precision medicine in oncology. OncoHope-23 targets a specific protein expressed on cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Further trials are planned to assess its efficacy in other cancer types, including breast cancer and colon cancer. The cost of the treatment is estimated to be around Rs. 2.5 lakh per patient per year, but the team is working on making it more affordable for the general population.", "normalised": "This research highlights the potential of precision medicine in oncology.
