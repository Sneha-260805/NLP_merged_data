{"unnormalised": "Neurology in India has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Diagnostic tools such as 3T MRI and advanced EEG techniques are now more widely available, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses of conditions like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS Delhi has published extensively on the use of these technologies. Furthermore, telemedicine is increasingly being used to reach patients in rural areas, allowing neurologists to provide consultations and monitor patients remotely. A recent study showed a 40% increase in access to neurological care in underserved regions due to telemedicine initiatives.", "normalised": "Neurology in India has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.

{"unnormalised": "Treatment options have also expanded considerably. For stroke, thrombolysis with tPA within the first 4.5 hrs remains the gold standard, but newer interventions like mechanical thrombectomy are becoming more common in major hospitals. In movement disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is now performed in several centres across India, offering relief to patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Moreover, research into neuroprotective agents and regenerative therapies is ongoing, with promising results emerging from institutions like NIMHANS Bangalore. Several clinical trials are underway, examining the efficacy of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.", "normalised": "Treatment options have also expanded considerably.

{"unnormalised": "However, challenges remain. The availability of specialized neurological care is still limited in many parts of the country, and the cost of advanced treatments can be prohibitive for many patients. The doctor-patient ratio in neurology is significantly lower than recommended international standards. More investment in training neurologists and providing access to affordable care is essential to improve outcomes for patients with neurological disorders in India. For instance, a lumbar puncture costs roughly Rs. 3000 at a govt. hospital. Increased awareness programs are also needed to reduce the stigma associated with neurological conditions and encourage early diagnosis and treatment.", "normalised": "However, challenges remain.
