My friend Priya’s mom, for example, recently had a stroke. She was admitted to AIIMS, Delhi and Dr. Sharma (neurologist) prescribed her some meds, including Aspirin 75mg. It's scary stuff, but neuro docs are there to help.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about neurology stuff. Well, neurology basically deals with the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
