The clinical trial, conducted over 12 months, showed a 30% reduction in cognitive decline among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who tested positive for specific biomarkers. Prof. Rajesh Kumar, Head of Neurology, stated the results are promising but require further research.", "normalised": "A-I-I-M-S Delhi announced a breakthrough in treating early-stage Alzheimer's using a new drug, Memantine X-R twenty eight milligram.

{"unnormalised": "The study, published in the \"Indian Journal of Neurology,\" involved 150 patients aged between 65 and 75 years. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving Memantine XR and the other a placebo. Regular cognitive assessments were conducted, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), to track progress. The initial results showed a significant difference in scores after 6 months, which continued to improve by the end of the trial period.", "normalised": "The study, published in the \"Indian Journal of Neurology,\" involved one hundred and fifty patients aged between sixty five and seventy five years.

{"unnormalised": "One key finding was the drug's effectiveness in slowing the progression of amyloid plaques in the brain. PET scans revealed a reduction in plaque buildup in the Memantine XR group compared to the placebo group. This suggests the drug might have a disease-modifying effect, potentially preventing the disease from advancing to later stages. The drug is not without side effects, however. Some participants reported mild dizziness and nausea.", "normalised": "One key finding was the drug's effectiveness in slowing the progression of amyloid plaques in the brain.

{"unnormalised": "Dr. Sunita Reddy, a neurologist at Fortis Hospital, Mumbai, commented that while the AIIMS study is encouraging, larger, multi-center trials are needed to confirm the findings. She also noted that the drug is not a cure for Alzheimer's but could potentially improve the quality of life for patients in the early stages of the disease. The results, if validated, could lead to a new standard of care for patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's.", "normalised": "Doctor Sunita Reddy, a neurologist at Fortis Hospital, Mumbai, commented that while the A-I-I-M-S study is encouraging, larger, multi-center trials are needed to confirm the findings.

They are also exploring the drug's potential in combination with other therapies. The hope is that Memantine XR 28mg could eventually become a viable option for delaying or preventing the onset of Alzheimer's disease, a condition affecting millions of elderly Indians.
