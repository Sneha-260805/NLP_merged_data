Doc Gupta explained it all to us, using big words like \"cerebrovascular accident\" and \"ischemic penumbra,\" which frankly, went right over my head.

{"unnormalised": "It's been a year, and Nana's doing much better. He still has some weakness on his left side, but he's walking with a cane and can manage most things on his own. We're so grateful to Dr. Gupta and the team at AIIMS. He still takes his meds religiously, and we've even convinced him to skip the evening walks when it's pouring cats and dogs during the monsoon. Neurology is complex, but timely intervention can really make a difference.", "normalised": "It has been a year, and Nana is doing much better.
