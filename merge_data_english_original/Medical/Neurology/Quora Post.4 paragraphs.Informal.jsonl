{"unnormalised": "Basically, neurology deals with the nervous system - the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Think of it like the electrical wiring of your body. When something goes wrong with that wiring, neurologists like Dr. Rajesh Kumar at AIIMS, New Delhi, step in to figure out what's happening. Common problems they treat are things like strokes, epilepsy (you know, seizures), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Diagnosis often involves tests like EEG to measure brain activity or an MRI scan costing around Rs. 8000 at a private clinic.", "normalised": "Basically, neurology deals with the nervous system - the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
