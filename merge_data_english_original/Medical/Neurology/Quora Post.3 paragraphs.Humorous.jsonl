Okay, look, if you're misplacing your spectacles more than your sanity, maybe it's time to book that appointment, bhai. Seriously though, forgetting things occasionally is normal – blaming it on that second cup of cutting chai is perfectly acceptable. However, if you're legit forgetting your own name or constantly misplacing your auto-rickshaw after bargaining for 10 minutes, then yeah, maybe Dr. Gupta at AIIMS, Delhi, should have a look.", "normalised": "Someone asked me if seeing a neurologist is worth it if you keep forgetting where you put your chai.

They can diagnose things like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and whether your brain cells are staging a dharna due to excessive Bollywood consumption.
