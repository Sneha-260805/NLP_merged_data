{"unnormalised": "Neurology, in simple terms, is the branch of medicine focused on the nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, and all the nerves in your body. Neurologists are specialists trained to diagnose and treat disorders of this complex system. Think of it as like, if your computer (your brain) is acting up or your wiring (your nerves) is getting crossed, a neurologist is the person you call. They don't usually perform surgery, that's more the domain of neurosurgeons.", "normalised": "Neurology, in simple terms, is the branch of medicine focused on the nervous system.

Well, persistent headaches can be a sign, especially if they're different from your usual headaches or accompanied by other symptoms.

Also, problems with memory, speech, or vision can be indicative of neurological issues. Don't self-diagnose based on Dr. Google! For example, sudden blurry vision in 1 eye could be Optic Neuritis and requires specialist attention.", "normalised": "Now, when do you need to consider a neurologist?
