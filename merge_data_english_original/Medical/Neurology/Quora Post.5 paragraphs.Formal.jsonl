{"unnormalised": "Neurological disorders are conditions affecting the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and potentially better outcomes. Several subtle signs might indicate an underlying neurological issue. It is vital to consult a neurologist, like Dr. Rajesh Mehra at AIIMS, if you experience persistent or concerning symptoms.", "normalised": "Neurological disorders are conditions affecting the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.

{"unnormalised": "One of the initial indicators can be changes in cognitive function. This may manifest as difficulty with memory, concentration, or problem-solving. For instance, forgetting familiar routes or struggling to recall recent conversations could be early warning signs. Subtle personality changes, such as increased irritability or apathy, can also be indicative of neurological issues. Pay close attention if someone close to you exhibits these changes. A detailed neurological assessment might involve tests such as an EEG costing around Rs. 2500.", "normalised": "One of the initial indicators can be changes in cognitive function.

A detailed neurological assessment might involve tests such as an E-E-G costing around rupee two thousand five hundred."}
{"unnormalised": "Motor function abnormalities are another area to watch out for. Tremors, muscle weakness, or difficulty with coordination could signal a neurological disorder. Frequent falls or stumbling, particularly without a clear cause, warrant medical attention. Additionally, sensory disturbances such as numbness, tingling, or unexplained pain in the limbs may be early signs of nerve damage. Medication like Gabapentin 300mg is sometimes prescribed for these conditions.", "normalised": "Motor function abnormalities are another area to watch out for.

{"unnormalised": "Changes in sleep patterns can sometimes indicate underlying neurological issues. While occasional sleep disturbances are normal, persistent insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness should be investigated. Certain sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea, are linked to neurological conditions. Moreover, persistent headaches, especially those accompanied by other neurological symptoms, such as vision changes or weakness, necessitate medical evaluation. If a doctor suspects a serious underlying issue, they may order a CT scan costing Rs. 4000 or more.", "normalised": "Changes in sleep patterns can sometimes indicate underlying neurological issues.

{"unnormalised": "It is important to remember that these symptoms can also be caused by other medical conditions or lifestyle factors. However, if you experience a combination of these signs or if they are persistent and concerning, it is crucial to seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological disorders. A visit to a specialist, like a neurologist at Fortis Hospital, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation.", "normalised": "It is important to remember that these symptoms can also be caused by other medical conditions or lifestyle factors.
