{"unnormalised": "Okay, seriously though, while you won't *literally* fry your brain like an egg on a hot tawa, pushing yourself too hard, especially when studying Neurology, can definitely have negative consequences. Think of it like this: your brain is like a super-powered auto-rickshaw. It can handle a lot, but if you're constantly revving the engine at max speed, 24/7, without any breaks, eventually, something's gotta give. We’re talking burnout, difficulty concentrating, maybe even forgetting what CN VII actually does. And who wants to forget Facial Nerve functions during the MBBS finals?", "normalised": "Okay, seriously though, while you will not literally fry your brain like an egg on a hot tawa, pushing yourself too hard, especially when studying Neurology, can definitely have negative consequences.

{"unnormalised": "The real culprits are sleep deprivation and stress. Burning the midnight oil, fueled by copious amounts of chai, might seem productive at the time, but it's a recipe for disaster. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function – memory consolidation, decision-making, the whole shebang. Stress hormones like cortisol go through the roof, potentially damaging brain cells in the long run. Plus, let's be honest, trying to memorize the entire Krebs cycle at 4:00 AM is hardly the most effective learning strategy.

{"unnormalised": "So, the answer? Balance, my friends! Regular breaks, a healthy diet (dal chawal over Maggi at 2 AM!), and most importantly, SLEEP! Your brain will thank you for it. And your exam scores will probably be better, too. Maybe. Now, if you'll excuse me, gotta go catch some Zzz's before Dr. Sharma gives us another pop quiz on the basal ganglia.
