{"unnormalised": "My Dadi, Mrs. Kamla Devi, had been experiencing these strange headaches for a while, almost daily around 4 PM. Dr. Rajesh at City Hospital suggested an MRI which revealed a minor neurological issue. He prescribed Nimodipine 30mg twice a day, and physiotherapy. Initially, we were worried sick. But after about 2 weeks of medication and regular physio, she's improved a lot. Now, the headaches are much less frequent, maybe once a week. Really grateful for the timely diagnosis.", "normalised": "My Dadi, Missus Kamla Devi, had been experiencing these strange headaches for a while, almost daily around four P M.
