{"unnormalised": "Early detection of neurological disorders is crucial for timely intervention and management. Several subtle signs can indicate an underlying neurological issue. One of the first signs may be persistent headaches, especially if accompanied by other symptoms. A person experiencing such headaches regularly should consult with Dr. Rajesh Kumar, MD, at AIIMS, New Delhi, for evaluation. Furthermore, unexplained muscle weakness or numbness, often starting in the limbs, could signal conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) or peripheral neuropathy. A common initial diagnostic step is an EMG, which costs approx. Rs. 3500 at many private labs.", "normalised": "Early detection of neurological disorders is crucial for timely intervention and management.

{"unnormalised": "Changes in cognitive function, such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, or problems with language, are also early warning signs. These could be indicative of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Pay attention to seemingly minor memory lapses, such as forgetting recent conversations or misplacing objects frequently. A neuropsychological assessment is usually recommended, often including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). One should also consult neurologists such as Dr. Ayesha Khan who works at Fortis Hospital.", "normalised": "Changes in cognitive function, such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, or problems with language, are also early warning signs.

{"unnormalised": "Visual disturbances, including blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), or loss of peripheral vision, can also point to neurological problems. These may stem from optic nerve damage or issues within the brain itself. Dizziness and balance problems can also be red flags. Persistent vertigo or unsteadiness, especially if accompanied by nausea or vomiting, should be evaluated by a neurologist. A VNG test might be ordered.", "normalised": "Visual disturbances, including blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), or loss of peripheral vision, can also point to neurological problems.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, any sudden change in personality or behavior warrants immediate medical attention. Irritability, mood swings, or a decline in social interaction could signal frontal lobe dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In such cases, it's essential to consult a specialist as soon as possible. A comprehensive neurological examination, possibly including an MRI scan costing around Rs. 8000, will help determine the root cause and guide appropriate treatment. Remember, early detection and intervention are key for improving outcomes in neurological disorders.", "normalised": "Lastly, any sudden change in personality or behavior warrants immediate medical attention.
