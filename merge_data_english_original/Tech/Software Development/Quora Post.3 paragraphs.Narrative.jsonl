{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about the future of software dev in India. Well, from what I've seen, it's booming! I remember back in '05, landing my first job after my MCA. The tech was so different then. We were mostly doing outsourced stuff, working with legacy systems using tech like VB6 and .NET 2.0. Salaries were okayish, around Rs. 1.8 LPA starting. Now, freshers are getting offers of 8 LPA and upwards, especially if they're good with Python, React or know things like cloud computing (AWS, Azure).", "normalised": "So, someone asked about the future of software development in India.

Plus, companies like TCS and Infosys are moving up the value chain, doing more cutting-edge work. My cousin, Aisha, joined a startup in Bangalore, working on AI stuff. She tells me they are using Kubernetes and Docker, stuff I didn't even know existed back when I started! She gets paid a lot and even has stock options; this was unheard of in the early 2000s.", "normalised": "The biggest change, I think, is the focus on product development now.
