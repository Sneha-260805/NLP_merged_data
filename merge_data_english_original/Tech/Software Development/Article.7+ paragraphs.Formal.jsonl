{"unnormalised": "One notable trend is the pervasive use of Agile methodologies. Many companies, from startups to established IT giants like TCS and Infosys, are adopting Scrum and Kanban frameworks to enhance project management and improve software delivery speed. Project timelines, often specified in days or weeks (e.g., 2 weeks sprints), are meticulously tracked using tools such as Jira and Asana. This emphasis on agility is forcing developers to become more adaptable and collaborative. Communication is key, with daily stand-up meetings at 9:30 AM becoming commonplace.", "normalised": "One notable trend is the pervasive use of Agile methodologies.

{"unnormalised": "The demand for specific programming languages and technologies continues to shift. While Java and Python remain popular choices, there’s a growing need for expertise in areas like cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP), data science (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and mobile app development (React Native, Flutter). According to a recent report by Nasscom, AI skills are particularly sought after, with salaries for AI engineers increasing by 20% YOY. Training institutes like NIIT and Aptech are offering specialized courses to address this skills gap.", "normalised": "The demand for specific programming languages and technologies continues to shift.

{"unnormalised": "Security concerns are also paramount. With an increasing number of cyberattacks targeting Indian businesses, the demand for cybersecurity professionals and secure coding practices is on the rise. Developers are now expected to have a solid understanding of OWASP principles and be proficient in secure coding techniques to mitigate vulnerabilities. Regular security audits are conducted, and penetration testing is often scheduled on a quarterly basis (e.g., Q3 2024).", "normalised": "Security concerns are also paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Another key challenge is the availability of talent in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. While metropolitan areas like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai have a well-established talent pool, attracting and retaining skilled developers in smaller cities remains difficult. Companies are increasingly exploring remote work arrangements and investing in training programs to address this issue. Online platforms like Coursera and Udemy are becoming increasingly popular for upskilling. Often the hiring decisions are based on a candidate's performance in online coding challenges and their portfolio on platforms like GitHub.", "normalised": "Another key challenge is the availability of talent in Tier two and Tier three cities.

These platforms enable businesses to develop applications quickly and easily, even without extensive coding knowledge. While these platforms are not expected to replace traditional software development entirely, they are becoming an increasingly important tool for rapid prototyping and citizen development. The cost of developing a simple application using these platforms can be as low as Rs. 50,000.", "normalised": "Finally, the increasing adoption of low-code or no-code platforms is another notable trend.
