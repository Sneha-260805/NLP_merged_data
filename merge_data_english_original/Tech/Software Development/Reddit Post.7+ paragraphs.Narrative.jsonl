{"unnormalised": "Fast forward to last year, after a disastrous attempt at preparing for UPSC (govt job pressure, you know how it is), I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in a full-stack development bootcamp at Masai School. It was intense! 9 AM to 9 PM, coding all day, every day. I remember feeling completely lost during the initial Javascript lectures. Like, what's a \"const\" even? My instructor, Prateek Sir, was a lifesaver though.
