The project manager has given us a deadline of 6 months, which seems ambitious. The database alone is 500GB, and a significant portion of it involves complex financial calculations.

{"unnormalised": "Our team is considering using Java with Spring Boot for the new microservices, deployed on AWS. We're also debating whether to use Docker containers for easier management and scalability. The CTO wants everything completed by Q4 2024, but initial estimates put us closer to Q1 2025. We're currently evaluating various migration strategies, including a phased approach versus a complete rewrite. Any advice from those with experience in large-scale COBOL migrations would be greatly appreciated.", "normalised": "Our team is considering using Java with Spring Boot for the new microservices, deployed on A-W-S.

Has anyone used a particular tool that they would highly recommend? Also, any thoughts on dealing with the inevitable performance bottlenecks that will arise during the transition? The original system was meticulously optimized over 20+ years, so matching that performance will be a challenge.
