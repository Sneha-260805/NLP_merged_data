{"unnormalised": "The initial setup went smoothly enough. We had our development environment configured, the database schema drafted, and a rudimentary user interface taking shape. Then came the first hurdle: integrating UPI payments. The NGO wanted to receive donations directly through the app, and integrating a payment gateway proved to be more complex than we had anticipated. We spent countless hours poring over documentation, grappling with API keys, and debugging error messages that seemed to appear out of nowhere.

As I sat there sipping the sweet, milky tea, I overheard a conversation between two auto-rickshaw drivers discussing a similar problem with their payment app. Turns out, one of them had encountered the same CORS issue and had found a workaround by configuring the server to accept requests from all origins (not exactly best practice, but hey, we were desperate!).", "normalised": "One particularly frustrating evening, after battling a C-O-R-S error for what felt like an eternity, I decided to take a break and grab a chai from the nearby dhaba.
