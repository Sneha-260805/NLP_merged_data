{"unnormalised": "I’ve been in this game for almost 10 years, from a tiny startup in Bangalore to a massive MNC in Gurgaon. And I’ve learned one thing: we have a unique…flavour…to how we approach development. First, there's the sheer scale. I remember one project, migrating 200 TB of data, deadlines were always yesterday. Then there's the \"jugaad\" – that beautiful, quintessentially Indian way of finding innovative, often unorthodox, solutions. Need to scale quickly and efficiently? We'll find a way, even if it involves duct-taping together existing systems and a whole lot of caffeine.", "normalised": "I’ve been in this game for almost ten years, from a tiny startup in Bangalore to a massive M-N-C in Gurgaon.

{"unnormalised": "This jugaad mentality, honestly, it’s born out of necessity. Resources can be tight. Budgets? Always shrinking. So, we learn to be resourceful. We learn to make do with what we have. We learn to optimise, to squeeze every last drop of performance out of our systems. And this, in turn, fosters a culture of innovation. We aren't afraid to experiment, to try new things, even if they seem a little…unconventional. I remember one time, we used a Raspberry Pi and some open-source software to build a monitoring system for a critical server. The official solution would have cost Rs. 50,000. Our solution? Rs. 5,000.", "normalised": "This jugaad mentality, honestly, it’s born out of necessity. Resources can be tight. Budgets? Always shrinking. So, we learn to be resourceful.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the sheer diversity of talent. Working alongside developers from every corner of India, each bringing their own unique perspectives and expertise, is incredibly enriching. We have people who are masters of legacy systems, fluent in languages like COBOL and Fortran. And then we have the young guns, fresh out of IIT Delhi or NIT Trichy, who are pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning. This blend of experience and innovation is what makes Indian software development so dynamic. Plus, the number of talented developers in this country is massive. I have seen a large number of developers with 7+ YoE ready to work 60+ hours a week.", "normalised": "And then there's the sheer diversity of talent.

I've pulled my share of all-nighters, fueled by copious amounts of chai and sheer willpower. Sometimes, it feels like we’re perpetually firefighting, constantly putting out one blaze after another. But even in the midst of the chaos, there’s a sense of camaraderie, a shared sense of purpose.

And maybe, just maybe, you'll appreciate it a little bit more. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bug to fix. The client wants it done by 5:00 PM IST. Wish me luck!
