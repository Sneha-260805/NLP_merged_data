{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me what are some challenges in software development projects in India. Well, bhai, there are many! One big thing is communication - imagine trying to explain a complex algorithm to a client who only understands Hindi using Google Translate! Then there's the whole 'chalta hai' attitude. Like, the code *mostly* works, so it's okay to release it? No, boss! That's how you get bugs that crash the whole system when users hit the server at 10:00 AM. And deadlines? They're more like suggestions, especially if a festival is coming up - no one wants to work during Diwali or Holi!", "normalised": "Someone asked me what are some challenges in software development projects in India.

They're coding in Java 7 when the rest of the world is on Java 17! Getting them up to speed takes time and money. Plus, there's always the risk of them getting poached by some MNC offering a salary of ₹30 LPA. It's a constant battle to retain skilled developers.", "normalised": "Another challenge is finding good talent, especially in tier two and tier three cities.
