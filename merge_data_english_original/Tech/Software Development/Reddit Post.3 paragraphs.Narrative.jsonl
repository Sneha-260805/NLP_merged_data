{"unnormalised": "So, I'm in a bit of a pickle with my software dev project. I'm building an app for local kirana stores in my area (near Andheri station, Mumbai) to manage their inventory, and I thought I was being all modern using React Native. Everything was smooth sailing until I tried integrating the payment gateway. Razorpay's documentation is a mess, version 2.x is completely different from v3.0, and I’m pulling my hair out trying to figure out which API endpoint to use for UPI payments. Spent like 4 hours straight yesterday debugging.", "normalised": "So, I'm in a bit of a pickle with my software development project.

So, I need to make the app super simple, even if it means compromising on some features. Initially, I planned to include fancy graphs and analytics, but now I'm thinking of just sticking to the basics – adding stock, updating prices, and accepting payments. I've been referencing tutorial series on YouTube, some uploaded around 2018, and it's a struggle translating outdated code to modern standards.

{"unnormalised": "Anyone else working on similar projects? What payment gateways are you using, and how did you handle the onboarding process for less tech-literate users? Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated! Maybe a good framework that won't make my head hurt as much as React Native with version conflicts? I'm open to suggestions; it just needs to handle like, say, around 500 products max for each store.", "normalised": "Anyone else working on similar projects?
