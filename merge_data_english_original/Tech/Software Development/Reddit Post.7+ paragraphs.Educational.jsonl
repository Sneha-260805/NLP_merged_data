{"unnormalised": "First off, forget the hype. You don't *need* a fancy degree from IIT or bits pilani to be a good programmer. I know plenty of self-taught devs who are killing it. The key thing is a solid foundation. Start with the basics. I'd recommend learning Python first. It's pretty beginner-friendly and has a huge community, especially in India. CodeWithHarry on YouTube is a great resource; check him out. He has tutorials covering from the basics of data types to building projects using Django.", "normalised": "First off, forget the hype.

{"unnormalised": "Next, choose a path. Web development? Mobile development? Data science? Each one has its own set of technologies. For web dev, look into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Learn React or Angular or Vue.js. I've found React to be pretty popular with companies here. Firebase is also a good idea for Backend work. Plus, there are loads of bootcamps now. Masai School and Newton School are pretty well-known, but do your research before committing.", "normalised": "Next, choose a path. Web development? Mobile development? Data science?

{"unnormalised": "One last tip: Learn to debug. Seriously. It's probably 80% of the job. Master your IDE, and learn how to use the debugger. Understanding the error messages will save you tons of time. When the program shows an error that is very very obscure, try doing a Google search with the error message and your tech stack. The results will mostly include a StackOverflow discussion where someone faced the same problem as you. Also learn how to use print statements effectively.", "normalised": "One last tip: Learn to debug. Seriously. It's probably eighty percent of the job.
