{"unnormalised": "Software development in India, while booming, presents its own unique set of challenges. One significant hurdle is access to consistent, high-speed internet, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Many developers still face connectivity issues, hindering collaboration and access to online resources. Furthermore, the reliance on older hardware, such as laptops with <8GB RAM, can severely impact productivity, particularly when working with resource-intensive IDEs and emulators. The prevalence of pirated software, while seemingly cost-effective, introduces security risks and legal liabilities, further complicating the development process. These technological limitations often force developers to adopt workarounds and compromise on efficiency.", "normalised": "Software development in India, while booming, presents its own unique set of challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another common challenge stems from the academic curriculum. While many universities produce a large number of graduates, the practical skills and knowledge needed for industry are often lacking. Companies often need to invest significant time and resources in training fresh graduates in technologies like ReactJS, .NET Core, or even basic Git commands. The curriculum often lags behind industry standards, leaving graduates unprepared for the demands of real-world projects. The emphasis on theoretical knowledge over practical application creates a gap that needs to be bridged with intensive on-the-job training and mentorship programs. The requirement to learn multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, and a regional language) can also be a challenge for some.", "normalised": "Another common challenge stems from the academic curriculum.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, project management and communication pose significant hurdles. Cultural nuances can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and delays. For instance, the reluctance to directly challenge senior members or to clearly communicate roadblocks can hinder progress. Time zone differences when working with global teams (e.g., US PST or Europe CET) require developers to work odd hours, affecting work-life balance. Keeping up with the latest technologies and frameworks (like Angular 15.2 or the latest version of NodeJS) also requires continuous learning and upskilling, putting additional pressure on developers. These multifaceted challenges necessitate a holistic approach to addressing the needs of software developers in India.", "normalised": "Finally, project management and communication pose significant hurdles.
