React v18.2, Angular 15.1, Vue 3.3… the list goes on. It's enough to make your head spin faster than a ceiling fan in a Mumbai summer. And don't even get me started on the different programming languages!

Trying to download a massive SDK package on a flaky connection? Torture, I tell you! This is especially true for folks in smaller towns and villages, where internet access might be limited to speeds of around 2Mbps.

Many colleges are still teaching outdated curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for the real world.
