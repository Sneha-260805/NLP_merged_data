{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, newbie dev here! I'm diving into software dev and trying to figure out the best approach for a small project. I'm planning to build a basic app using Python, but I'm getting lost in the sheer number of frameworks. Should I go with Django, Flask, or something else? I've heard good things about both, but I'm not sure which one is more beginner-friendly and better suited for a project that I expect to take around 2 weeks to complete. Any advice from seasoned developers would be greatly appreciated!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, newbie dev here!

{"unnormalised": "Also, could someone explain the difference between using pip vs. conda for package management? I understand that conda is an environment manager and pip installs packages, but I'm still unclear on when to use one over the other. I'm working on a Windows 11 machine, and the tutorials I've been watching seem to jump between the two. I also have to use Visual Studio 2022 for some classes, so is there any conflict with conda?", "normalised": "Also, could someone explain the difference between using pip versus conda for package management?

{"unnormalised": "Finally, I saw some discussions on Stack Overflow mentioning Docker. Is this something I should consider for this simple app, or is it overkill? The app will have a very basic UI, maybe 3 or 4 screens, and will interact with a small local database, around 200-300 entries. The goal is to learn, so I'm happy to put in the effort, but I don't want to get bogged down in complexity if it's not necessary right now.
