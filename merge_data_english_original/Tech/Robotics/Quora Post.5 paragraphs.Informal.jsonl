{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone's asking about robotics in India? Cool topic! It's not exactly booming like, say, IT was in the 90s, but things are definitely picking up, especially with the \"Make in India\" initiative and all that. You see a lot of buzz around drone tech these days; agriculture and surveillance are big areas. DRDO's been doing a fair bit of robotics research for ages, mainly for defense purposes obviously.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone's asking about robotics in India? Cool topic!

{"unnormalised": "Now, what's interesting is that smaller companies are also getting into the game. You see start-ups focused on things like automated cleaning robots for hospitals (very useful in these COVID times, no?) and even some dabbling in AI-powered robotics for manufacturing. Think of it this way: if you want a robot to sort parcels at Flipkart or Amazon, well, someone's gotta build it!

{"unnormalised": "The problem, as I see it, is still the cost factor. A decent industrial robot arm can easily set you back Rs. 20,00,000 – that's 20 lakh rupees! – and smaller businesses often can't afford that kind of initial investment. Plus, there's the whole issue of skilled labour to maintain and program these robots. We need more vocational training institutes to churn out engineers who can handle the complexities of robotics. IITs are great, but they are not enough.", "normalised": "The problem, as I see it, is still the cost factor.

{"unnormalised": "But hey, don't get me wrong, I am optimistic. The government's investing in AI and robotics research centers. You've got companies like Reliance and Tata showing increasing interest. And of course, the whole push for automation across industries is only going to create more demand for robotics solutions. I read somewhere that India's robotics market could be worth $5 billion by 2025.", "normalised": "But hey, don't get me wrong, I am optimistic.

More engineers and businesses are needed to jump in, and more awareness as well! Remember to do your own research for better and more precise stats, this is just from my perspective!", "normalised": "So, yeah, robotics in India is definitely a space to watch.
