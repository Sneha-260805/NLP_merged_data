{"unnormalised": "India's robotics scene is really picking up speed! We're seeing interesting developments, especially in areas like agriculture and defense. For example, DRDO is working on several autonomous vehicles for surveillance, and some IITs are developing robots for crop harvesting. You might also see robots being used more in manufacturing, esp. in the automotive sector around Chennai. It's still early days, but the potential is huge.", "normalised": "India's robotics scene is really picking up speed!

{"unnormalised": "One exciting area is the use of robotics in healthcare. A few hospitals like AIIMS Delhi are experimenting with robotic surgery systems. These systems can perform complex procedures with greater precision. Plus, there's research happening on using robots to assist elderly care, which is really needed as the population ages. Think of robots that can remind patients to take their meds at 8:00 AM or help them move around their homes! Of course, the cost is still a factor - robotic surgery can cost Rs. 5 lakhs or more.", "normalised": "One exciting area is the use of robotics in healthcare.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, robotics in India is at a crucial turning point. While we might not be at the level of Japan or the US, the combination of government support, academic research, and private investment is creating a vibrant ecosystem. Keep an eye out for startups focusing on niche applications like cleaning solar panels (a big problem in Rajasthan!) or delivering packages with drones. It's a very interesting space to watch for the next 5-10 years.", "normalised": "Overall, robotics in India is at a crucial turning point.
