Been following the field closely for a few yrs now, and it's honestly mind-blowing how far things have come.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I saw this question about robotics and thought I'd chip in my two cents!

{"unnormalised": "So, thinking about the current state of robotics in India, it's a mixed bag, honestly. We're not exactly Boston Dynamics yet, but there's some serious cool stuff happening. A lot of it is in the industrial sector, you know, automation and all that. Companies like Tata Steel and Mahindra are using robots for things like welding and assembly, which boosts production by like, 20% or so, I read somewhere.", "normalised": "So, thinking about the current state of robotics in India, it's a mixed bag, honestly.

{"unnormalised": "But it's not just factories, ya know? Agriculture is a big one. Some startups are developing agri-bots that can do things like weeding and harvesting. Imagine, a robot plowing fields in Punjab! The govt is even pushing it, offering subsidies of up to ₹2 lakh to farmers who adopt these technologies.

That's huge, man! Plus, there's research going on in assistive robotics for elderly care.

{"unnormalised": "Now, where do I think India's at compared to, say, Japan or the US? We're playing catch-up, no doubt. They've been at this for decades. But we have advantages too. We've got a massive talent pool of engineers, and a HUGE need for automation in almost every sector. Plus, our IT sector is world-class, which gives us a leg up in developing the software and AI needed for advanced robotics.", "normalised": "Now, where do I think India's at compared to, say, Japan or the U-S?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Funding is always an issue. A lot of these startups are struggling to get the capital they need. And there's the whole issue of job displacement. People are worried that robots will take away their jobs. The govt needs to address these concerns with appropriate policies. And skilling programs, for real. No joke.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Funding is always an issue. A lot of these startups are struggling to get the capital they need.

{"unnormalised": "But overall, I'm optimistic about the future of robotics in India. We've got the brains, the need, and the potential. Give it another 5-10 yrs, and I think you'll see some seriously impressive stuff coming out of India. Keep an eye on companies like GreyOrange and Sastra Robotics. They're doing some really innovative work. And watch out for IIT Madras; they've got a killer robotics research program. Plus, a lot of smaller firms like the ones working with DRDO for defence applications. The next thing you know, every household will have one, costing maybe Rs. 30,000? Who knows!
