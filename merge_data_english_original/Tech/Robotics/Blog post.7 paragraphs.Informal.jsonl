We often think of robots as something futuristic, maybe like those in Bollywood sci-fi movies (remember Robot?), but the truth is, they're already here in India, and their impact is growing faster than you can say \"artificial intelligence.\"", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

Companies like Tata Steel are using robots to automate heavy lifting and welding, increasing efficiency by, like, 30%. It's seriously impressive! But the application of robotics is way wider than that.", "normalised": "I used to picture robots as just factory arms, doing repetitive tasks. And yeah, that's still a big part of it.

This could revolutionize farming practices, especially for small farmers who often struggle with labor shortages and 90% of farmers lack access to latest technology. These little guys can work 24/7!", "normalised": "Think about agriculture. A startup in Pune is developing agri-bots that can monitor crop health using A-I and even autonomously spray pesticides.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's healthcare. Apollo Hospitals are exploring the use of surgical robots for minimally invasive procedures. Imagine a surgeon in Chennai controlling a robot to perform a complex surgery on a patient in Guwahati. It’s not just about precision; it's about accessibility, bringing specialized care to underserved areas. The cost is high right now- each surgery could cost Rs. 200000 but prices are expected to go down.", "normalised": "Then there's healthcare.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Cost is a major barrier, and we need to address the ethical considerations of job displacement, and the question of \"who is to blame if an accident occurs?\". But the potential benefits of robotics in India are immense. From boosting productivity in manufacturing to improving healthcare access and revolutionizing agriculture, robots have the power to transform our economy and society. I'm seeing projections that the Indian robotics market will be worth $5 billion USD by 2025.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.
