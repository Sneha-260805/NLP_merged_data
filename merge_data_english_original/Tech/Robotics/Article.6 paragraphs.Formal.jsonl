{"unnormalised": "In the manufacturing sector, robotics is primarily deployed for tasks involving repetitive motions, heavy lifting, and hazardous environments. Automotive companies like Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors have extensively incorporated robotic arms and automated assembly lines to improve production speed and ensure consistent quality. For instance, robotic welding systems can complete 120 welds per hour, a substantial increase compared to manual welding. Furthermore, warehouses and logistics centers are increasingly utilizing robots for sorting, packing, and transportation of goods, thereby streamlining supply chain operations. Godrej & Boyce is one such company that is using automation at its fullest.", "normalised": "In the manufacturing sector, robotics is primarily deployed for tasks involving repetitive motions, heavy lifting, and hazardous environments.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the promising potential, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of robotics in India. The high initial investment costs associated with acquiring and implementing robotic systems pose a significant barrier for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, the lack of skilled personnel capable of operating and maintaining these systems necessitates substantial investments in training and education programs. The presence of an adequate infrastructure is another concern, because 40% of India doesn’t have proper access to the most basic amenities for robotics to function.", "normalised": "Despite the promising potential, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of robotics in India.
