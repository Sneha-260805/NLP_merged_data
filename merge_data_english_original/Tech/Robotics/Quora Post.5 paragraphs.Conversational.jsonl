We're not quite Boston Dynamics yet, but there's some seriously cool stuff happening. I saw a demo at IIT Bombay a few months back. They were showing off a robot designed for agricultural use. Apparently, it can identify ripe tomatoes using image recognition software and pick them automatically. Pretty neat, huh? They said it would boost efficiency by something like 40%, though I'm not sure about the exact figures (maybe around 35-45%?).", "normalised": "Someone asked me recently about the robotics scene in India, and honestly, it's pretty exciting!

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole medical robotics area. A friend of mine, Dr. Patel at AIIMS, mentioned they're starting to use robotic arms for some surgeries. It's supposed to improve precision and reduce recovery time. He showed me an article about a surgery done with the Da Vinci robot on 22/07/2023. He claims the recovery time has decreased by 2 weeks, but i think it really depends on the patient and the complexity of the procedure. There are a couple of startups in Bangalore that are focusing on prosthetics too. They're developing bionic limbs that can be controlled with the user's thoughts.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole medical robotics area.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges. Funding is always an issue, and access to advanced components can be tricky. Plus, there's the whole \"Made in India\" push. While it's great for local manufacturing, it can sometimes mean using slightly older tech because the really cutting-edge stuff isn't easily available here. I think they said the new robotic arm in the Apollo Hospital in Chennai cost Rs. 2.5 crores.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges.
