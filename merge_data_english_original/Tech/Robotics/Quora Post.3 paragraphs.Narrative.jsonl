{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about the future of robotics in India. Honestly, it's exciting but also feels a bit...distant, you know? Like something you see in a Bollywood sci-fi movie with robots that can dance to item songs. But jokes aside, I saw a presentation at IIT Bombay last month about this new agri-robot. They're saying it can automate pesticide spraying, which is great news for farmers in places like Punjab who are struggling with labor shortages. The prof. showing it off mentioned it was still in the prototype phase though, aiming for a commercial release sometime in 2025 or maybe early 2026.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about the future of robotics in India.

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, robotics in India, especially when we talk beyond just industrial automation (which is already pretty widespread in places like Gurgaon's auto factories), faces a lot of hurdles. Cost is a big one. Most farmers can't afford a fancy robot that costs ₹5,00,000, even if it increases their yield by 20%. Then there’s the infrastructure issue. Not all villages have reliable electricity or internet connectivity for remote monitoring and control. Plus, servicing and maintenance will be a nightmare in remote areas. My cousin, Ramesh, who's an engineer in Bangalore, says the biggest challenge is making these robots robust enough to handle the dusty, unpredictable Indian climate.", "normalised": "The thing is, robotics in India, especially when we talk beyond just industrial automation (which is already pretty widespread in places like Gurgaon's auto factories), faces a lot of hurdles.

I read in a recent article that the GOI is planning to invest ₹7500 crore in robotics research over the next 5 years. Also, the younger generation is incredibly tech-savvy. Maybe someone reading this will be the one to build the next big thing in Indian robotics. I'm personally betting on robots that can make perfect chai, delivered right to your doorstep!", "normalised": "Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic.
