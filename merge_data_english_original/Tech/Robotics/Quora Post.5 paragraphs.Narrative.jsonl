{"unnormalised": "My cousin, Rohan, is working on AI-powered robots at IIT Bombay. He says they're developing bots for agriculture, you know, helping farmers with stuff like irrigation and harvesting. Apparently, the prototypes can cover 5 acres per day, which is insane compared to manual labor. Plus, companies like Bharat Forge are investing heavily in robotics for manufacturing. They're automating their plants with robotic arms and stuff to increase efficiency by, like, 30%.", "normalised": "My cousin, Rohan, is working on A-I-powered robots at I-I-T Bombay.

{"unnormalised": "And it's not just about factories and farms. Think about healthcare. Dr. Shetty at Narayana Health is experimenting with robotic surgery. He told me once that these robots can perform complex operations with 99% accuracy and minimal invasion. It's mind-blowing! They even used it on my grandpa for a knee replacement back in 2022 at a cost of Rs. 2.5 lakhs. Recovered super fast.", "normalised": "And it's not just about factories and farms.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, the potential is unlimited. From defense to space exploration, robotics will play a crucial role in India's development. It might not be the Jetsons just yet, but we're definitely moving towards a future where robots are an integral part of our lives. The current market is valued at USD 2.8 billion and it’s projected to grow at CAGR of 22% until 2030. So yeah, robotics in India has a very bright future!", "normalised": "Honestly, the potential is unlimited.
