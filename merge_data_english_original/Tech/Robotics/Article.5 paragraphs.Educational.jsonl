{"unnormalised": "One area where robotics is making significant strides is in healthcare. Hospitals like AIIMS in Delhi are experimenting with robotic surgery systems to improve precision and reduce recovery times. Dr. Sharma mentioned during a tech conference held on 22/07/2024, that robotic assistance reduces the margin of error by almost 70% in complex procedures. Furthermore, robots are being deployed for tasks such as delivering medications and disinfecting hospital rooms, particularly crucial during pandemics like COVID-19. Startups like GreyOrange are also developing warehouse automation solutions to manage inventory with greater speed and accuracy.", "normalised": "One area where robotics is making significant strides is in healthcare.

{"unnormalised": "The agricultural sector is another promising area. With land holdings often small and labor costs rising, farmers are looking to robotic solutions for tasks such as planting, harvesting, and crop monitoring. Drones equipped with sensors and cameras can provide real-time data on soil conditions and crop health, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation and fertilization. Several pilot projects are underway in Maharashtra, using robots to automate tasks like weeding and spraying pesticides, reducing the need for manual labor and minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals. One such project yielded 20% more produce per acre.", "normalised": "The agricultural sector is another promising area.

The initial investment cost is high, and there is a need for skilled technicians to maintain and repair these machines. Furthermore, concerns about job displacement need to be addressed through upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Govt. schemes such as Skill India need to adapt to provide training programs specifically focused on robotics and automation, ensuring that the workforce is prepared for the changing job market. A survey conducted by IIT Bombay found that 65% of engineers felt unprepared for the robotics field.", "normalised": "However, the adoption of robotics in India also presents challenges.
