{"unnormalised": "However, several hurdles need to be addressed. The high initial investment costs associated with robotic systems present a barrier for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Government subsidies and incentives are crucial to encourage SMEs to embrace automation. In addition, the current skill gap poses a significant challenge. There's a shortage of skilled personnel capable of designing, operating, and maintaining robotic systems. The focus needs to shift towards creating vocational training programs and incorporating robotics into engineering curricula at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.", "normalised": "However, several hurdles need to be addressed.

{"unnormalised": "Ethical considerations also warrant attention. As robots become more sophisticated and integrated into daily life, concerns about job displacement, data privacy, and algorithmic bias must be proactively addressed. Robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines are essential to ensure responsible development and deployment of robotic technologies. It's also imperative to have frameworks in place that address concerns of data privacy for scenarios like remote healthcare, for example with applications monitoring patient health in elderly patients (over 65 yrs old).", "normalised": "Ethical considerations also warrant attention.
