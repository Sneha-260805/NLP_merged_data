{"unnormalised": "Hey folks! Ever since I watched \"Robot\" with Rajinikanth, I've been kinda fascinated with robotics. It’s not just sci-fi anymore, you know? Here in India, robotics is slowly but surely making its mark, and it's pretty cool to see. So, let’s dive into what’s happening in the world of robots, right here at home.", "normalised": "Hey folks!

{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's talk about education. Places like IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi are churning out some seriously talented roboticists. I saw a demo by some students from VIT Vellore last month at a tech fest; their robot could solve a Rubik’s cube in under 2 minutes! That's faster than I can make chai in the morning. These young minds are our future, folks, and they're ready to build some awesome stuff.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's talk about education.

{"unnormalised": "Now, where are all these robots actually being used? Well, manufacturing is a big one. Companies are using robots for everything from assembling cars to packaging goods. It's all about efficiency and precision, and robots are really good at doing repetitive tasks without getting bored, unlike yours truly. I read an article saying that Maruti Suzuki has increased its robotic automation by 30% in the last 5 years.", "normalised": "Now, where are all these robots actually being used?

{"unnormalised": "Agriculture is another exciting area. Imagine robots planting seeds, watering crops, and even harvesting fruits – all without human intervention! This could be a game-changer for Indian farmers, especially with the challenges of climate change and labor shortages. I even heard that a company in Pune is developing a robot that can detect crop diseases using AI, pretty neat, huh? They're apparently targeting a Rs. 2 Lakh price point for the entry level model.", "normalised": "Agriculture is another exciting area.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, we can't forget about healthcare. Robots are being used in surgeries (with human doctors overseeing, of course!), rehabilitation, and even dispensing medication. It's all about improving patient outcomes and reducing the workload on our already strained healthcare system.

{"unnormalised": "But it's not all sunshine and roses. There are definitely concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of AI. We need to have these conversations now, before robots become completely integrated into our lives.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the future of robotics in India? Honestly, I think it's bright. We have the talent, the resources, and the need for innovative solutions. From agriculture to healthcare to manufacturing, robots have the potential to transform our society for the better. Just as long as they don’t decide to replace us all with robots from Bollywood movies (looking at you, Chitti 2.0!), we should be just fine. What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments!", "normalised": "So, what's the future of robotics in India? Honestly, I think it's bright. We have the talent, the resources, and the need for innovative solutions.
