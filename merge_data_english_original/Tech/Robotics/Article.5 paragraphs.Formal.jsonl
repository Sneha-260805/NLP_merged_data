{"unnormalised": "However, the Indian robotics industry faces several challenges. One major hurdle is the high cost of advanced robotic systems, often quoted in USD. For example, a sophisticated industrial robot arm can cost upwards of $100,000. This price point makes adoption difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which constitute a large segment of the Indian economy. Furthermore, the lack of readily available local components and the reliance on imports further exacerbates the cost issue.", "normalised": "However, the Indian robotics industry faces several challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant challenge is the need for robust infrastructure and skilled personnel for maintenance and repair. A recent survey indicated that approximately 60% of companies face difficulties in finding qualified technicians to service their robotic systems. This issue is particularly acute in rural areas, where access to training and resources is limited. Government initiatives are underway to address this skills gap, with plans to establish specialized training centers across the country.", "normalised": "Another significant challenge is the need for robust infrastructure and skilled personnel for maintenance and repair.
