{"unnormalised": "The challenge, I think, is making robots that actually work in Indian conditions. Our roads are chaotic, our farms are different, our hospitals are... well, you get the idea. A robot designed for a factory in Germany isn't going to be much use in a textile mill in Surat. But that's also the opportunity, right? To build robots specifically for India, by Indians.

But robots will definitely be a bigger part of our lives, from helping doctors in AIIMS to assisting farmers in Punjab. I’m pretty sure my nephew, Aryan, who's studying engineering, will be part of that wave.
