{"unnormalised": "One of the primary drivers of robotics adoption in India is the manufacturing sector. Companies are increasingly investing in robotic arms and automated systems to enhance productivity, improve quality control, and reduce operational costs. For instance, Maruti Suzuki has deployed over 500 robots in its Gurgaon plant to streamline its assembly line. These robots perform tasks such as welding, painting, and material handling with greater precision and efficiency than human workers. This automation is particularly crucial in industries facing labor shortages or demanding high levels of accuracy.", "normalised": "One of the primary drivers of robotics adoption in India is the manufacturing sector.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, robotics is making significant strides in the healthcare industry in India. Surgical robots, such as the Da Vinci system, are being utilized in major hospitals like AIIMS, New Delhi, and Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, to perform complex procedures with minimal invasiveness. These robots offer surgeons enhanced dexterity, precision, and control, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced recovery times. The cost of a robotic surgery typically ranges from Rs. 2 lakhs to Rs. 5 lakhs, depending on the complexity of the procedure.", "normalised": "Furthermore, robotics is making significant strides in the healthcare industry in India.

{"unnormalised": "The agricultural sector, another critical component of the Indian economy, is also beginning to embrace robotics. Agricultural robots, such as drones and automated tractors, are being used for tasks such as crop monitoring, precision irrigation, and harvesting. These robots can help farmers optimize resource utilization, reduce labor costs, and increase crop yields. For example, a drone can survey 10 acres of farmland in just 1 hour, providing valuable insights into crop health and potential issues.", "normalised": "The agricultural sector, another critical component of the Indian economy, is also beginning to embrace robotics.

For example, a drone can survey ten acres of farmland in just one hour, providing valuable insights into crop health and potential issues."}
{"unnormalised": "However, the widespread adoption of robotics in India is not without its challenges. High initial investment costs, lack of skilled workforce, and regulatory hurdles are some of the key obstacles that need to be addressed. The cost of a single industrial robot can range from Rs. 20 lakhs to Rs. 1 crore, making it difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to invest in this technology. Moreover, there is a shortage of trained engineers and technicians who can operate, maintain, and repair these robots.", "normalised": "However, the widespread adoption of robotics in India is not without its challenges.
