{"unnormalised": "The KrishiBot prototype uses advanced sensors and AI algorithms to identify and remove weeds without damaging crops. It navigates fields using GPS and visual mapping, covering approximately 1 acre per day. The team claims this is 3x faster than manual weeding, with comparable accuracy. The robot runs on solar power and costs about ₹250,000 to build.", "normalised": "The KrishiBot prototype uses advanced sensors and A-I algorithms to identify and remove weeds without damaging crops.

{"unnormalised": "“We wanted to create a solution that is both affordable and effective for Indian farmers,” explained Dr. Meena Sharma, the project lead. “Many smallholder farms struggle with labor costs and weed infestations. KrishiBot can help reduce these burdens and improve their livelihoods.” The team is now working on incorporating additional functionalities, such as automated irrigation and fertilizer application. They hope to commercialize the technology within the next 2 years.", "normalised": "“We wanted to create a solution that is both affordable and effective for Indian farmers,” explained Doctor Meena Sharma, the project lead. “Many smallholder farms struggle with labor costs and weed infestations.
