Imagine a world where your auto-rickshaw driver is a robot named \"Raju 2.0\" who *actually* follows traffic rules. Yeah, I'm holding my breath too. Maybe by 2050, they'll have perfected a robot that can handle the Mumbai local train rush hour – now *that's* a real challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, the potential is huge. Think about agriculture – robots planting rice in paddy fields, maybe even harvesting tea in Darjeeling. We could see a boost in efficiency that's beyond anything we've seen before. My grandma would probably still yell at it for not doing it properly, though. But hey, progress is progress, right? And don’t even get me started on manufacturing. Forget \"Made in China,\" we’ll be saying \"Assembled by Robot in Chennai.\" Factories with 100% automation? Seems like a pipe dream now, but maybe not so far off.", "normalised": "Seriously though, the potential is huge.
