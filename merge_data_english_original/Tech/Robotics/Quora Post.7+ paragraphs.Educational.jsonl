{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's acknowledge that India is a developing market for robotics, but it's growing rapidly. You'll find pockets of excellence, especially in research institutions like IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore. They're doing some seriously cool stuff with AI-powered robots and automation, publishing papers in journals and even securing patents. Funding from both govt and private sources is picking up, which is really encouraging. A recent report estimated the market to be worth USD 2.8 billion by 2025, with a CAGR of around 13%.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's acknowledge that India is a developing market for robotics, but it's growing rapidly.

{"unnormalised": "However, adoption in industries is still relatively nascent compared to countries like Japan or South Korea. We're not seeing widespread deployment of robots in manufacturing plants across the board just yet, but the interest is definitely there. Sectors like automotive, pharmaceuticals, and even agriculture are exploring how robotics can improve efficiency and reduce costs. For instance, Mahindra is using robots for some assembly line processes, and a few startups are developing robots for precision farming. You see the growth happening in the robotics segment with many new companies establishing their footprints.", "normalised": "However, adoption in industries is still relatively nascent compared to countries like Japan or South Korea.

{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is the cost of robotics technology. Importing robots from abroad can be quite expensive, especially with fluctuating exchange rates (e.g., Rs. 83 to the USD). This makes it difficult for smaller businesses and SMEs to invest in robotics solutions. The government is trying to address this by promoting local manufacturing and providing subsidies, but it's a long-term process. The Make in India initiative aims to boost domestic robotics production and reduce reliance on imports. This will also create more jobs in the robotics sector itself.", "normalised": "One major challenge is the cost of robotics technology.

{"unnormalised": "Another factor is the availability of skilled manpower. We need more engineers and technicians who are trained in robotics, AI, and related fields. While institutions like IITs and NITs are offering courses in robotics, the supply is still not enough to meet the growing demand. There's a need for more vocational training programs and skill development initiatives to bridge this gap. The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is playing a key role in promoting robotics education and training.", "normalised": "Another factor is the availability of skilled manpower.

{"unnormalised": "The type of robots deployed also varies. Right now, industrial robots used for tasks like welding, painting, and assembly are the most common. But we're also seeing a rise in collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside humans safely. Service robots are still relatively rare, but there's growing interest in using them for tasks like healthcare, logistics, and even security. For instance, some hospitals are piloting robots to deliver medicines and assist nurses.", "normalised": "The type of robots deployed also varies.
