I mean, who would have thought that something out of a sci-fi movie would be so commonplace in our cities by 2024? It's all thanks to the advancements in AI and machine learning, coupled with the \"Make in India\" initiative pushing local manufacturing of these technologies. We are even seeing robots in agriculture now, assisting farmers with tasks like planting and harvesting, imagine that!", "normalised": "Robotics in India is having a serious moment, isn't it?

{"unnormalised": "One area where robotics is making a huge impact is in healthcare. Hospitals like AIIMS are starting to use robotic surgery systems, allowing doctors to perform complex procedures with incredible precision. In fact, Dr. Sharma mentioned at a conference last month that robotic surgeries have reduced recovery times by almost 40% in some cases. And its not just surgery, there's also robots being developed to assist with rehabilitation, dispensing medication, and even providing companionship to elderly patients. Imagine the possibilities!", "normalised": "One area where robotics is making a huge impact is in healthcare.

{"unnormalised": "The manufacturing sector is another big player. Companies like Tata Motors are investing heavily in robotic automation to improve efficiency and reduce costs. We are talking entire assembly lines operated by robots, welding, painting, and assembling car parts. This is also helping them to meet the growing demand for automobiles, both domestically and internationally. It’s expected that over 60% of manufacturing processes will be fully automated by 2030.", "normalised": "The manufacturing sector is another big player.
