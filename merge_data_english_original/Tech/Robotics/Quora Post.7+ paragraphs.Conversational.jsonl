{"unnormalised": "In manufacturing, for instance, you'll find robots are already doing a lot of heavy lifting, literally! Companies like Tata Steel are implementing robotic arms for assembly lines. It's not just the big players; even MSMEs are exploring automating processes with smaller, collaborative robots, often referred to as \"cobots.\" The aim? To boost productivity by around 20%, I heard somewhere.", "normalised": "In manufacturing, for instance, you will find robots are already doing a lot of heavy lifting, literally!

Mahindra is working on autonomous tractors, and several startups are developing drones for spraying pesticides and monitoring crop health. Imagine a drone hovering over a field in Punjab, collecting data - pretty cool, right? These innovations could potentially increase crop yields by 15-20%.", "normalised": "Agriculture is another area where robotics is slowly picking up pace.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the healthcare sector. Hospitals like AIIMS Delhi are starting to use robots for surgery and rehabilitation. While it's still early days, the potential to improve precision and patient outcomes is huge. The use of robotics in telemedicine, particularly in rural areas, is also being explored. I read a report estimating a 30% reduction in post-operative recovery time through robotic surgery.", "normalised": "Then there is the healthcare sector.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, the development of robotics requires a strong foundation in research and education. Institutions like IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore are actively involved in robotics research, focusing on areas like AI, machine learning, and computer vision. They are offering specialized courses like M.Tech in Robotics and Automation. From what I know, the number of students enrolling in these courses has increased by 40% in the last 3 yrs.", "normalised": "Of course, the development of robotics requires a strong foundation in research and education.

{"unnormalised": "But, there are challenges. The high cost of robots, lack of skilled manpower, and concerns about job displacement are major hurdles. We need more investment in R&D, skill development programs, and policies that promote responsible automation. Cost of industrial robots can range from Rs. 5 Lakhs to Rs. 50 Lakhs, depending on the complexity.", "normalised": "But, there are challenges.
