{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, while we might not have Boston Dynamics levels of sophisticated robots roaming around, we are definitely getting there. Companies like GreyOrange are building robots for warehouses, and startups are popping up left and right with crazy cool ideas. Plus, our engineers at IIT are probably already plotting to build a chai-serving robot that can also solve quadratic equations. All we need is a little funding, some open-source code, and maybe a nationwide competition to build the ultimate Desi robot. First prize? A lifetime supply of samosas, obviously.", "normalised": "Seriously though, while we might not have Boston Dynamics levels of sophisticated robots roaming around, we are definitely getting there.

{"unnormalised": "But honestly, the real robot revolution in India won't be about humanoid robots doing our laundry. It will be about using robotics to solve real problems, like automating agriculture or cleaning up our rivers. It's about making life easier and more efficient, even if it involves a few sparks and the occasional system crash (after all, we're still Indians, Ctrl+Alt+Del is practically our national anthem). So yeah, India is absolutely ready for a robot revolution – one that's powered by ingenuity, innovation, and a healthy dose of \"chalega\" attitude! Expect to see more of them by, say, 2030.", "normalised": "But honestly, the real robot revolution in India won't be about humanoid robots doing our laundry.
