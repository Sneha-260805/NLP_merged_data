{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about robotics in India. It's actually a pretty interesting field that's starting to gain traction, ya know? We're not quite at the level of Boston Dynamics yet, but things are definitely moving. You see more and more students from IITs and NITs getting involved in robotics competitions, building cool stuff like autonomous rovers and robotic arms. Some startups are even coming up, focusing on things like agricultural robots and robots for warehouse automation. One company I saw was using AI and robotics for sorting waste. Pretty cool, right?", "normalised": "So, someone asked about robotics in India. It is actually a pretty interesting field that is starting to gain traction, you know?

{"unnormalised": "A major challenge, though, is funding. Most Indian companies in the robotics space are still relatively small, and securing VC funding can be tough. Plus, the cost of components is high. Importing sensors and microcontrollers and all that jazz can really add up. And the talent pool, while growing, still isn't huge. We need more engineers with expertise in areas like AI, computer vision, and mechanical design. Some universities, like IIIT Hyderabad, are starting dedicated robotics programs, so hopefully, that will help.", "normalised": "A major challenge, though, is funding.

{"unnormalised": "Despite the challenges, there's a lot of potential. India has a huge manufacturing sector, and there's a growing need for automation to improve efficiency and productivity. Sectors like agriculture and healthcare could also benefit massively from robotics. Imagine robots helping farmers with tasks like planting and harvesting or assisting doctors with surgeries. The market size is projected to reach USD 5 billion by 2025, according to some reports. So, definitely a space to watch.", "normalised": "Despite the challenges, there is a lot of potential.

{"unnormalised": "And honestly, I think the \"Make in India\" initiative can really give the robotics industry a boost. Encouraging local manufacturing of robotic components would lower costs and create more jobs. There are some smaller companies already trying, but we need bigger players to step in. Also, it's important to get more girls involved! It is usually just the boys in the lab and at robotics competitions. So yeah, robotics in India: potential is huge, but definitely needs more support and a whole lot more development.", "normalised": "And honestly, I think the \"Make in India\" initiative can really give the robotics industry a boost.
