{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India, right? It’s a pretty exciting space! I see a lot of potential, especially with the \"Make in India\" push. You've got companies like GreyOrange already doing some cool stuff with warehouse automation – their robots are used by Flipkart and others, I think. And then there are smaller startups popping up, focusing on things like agricultural robots. Imagine robots helping farmers in places like Punjab and Haryana! I saw one article that estimated the robotics market in India could be worth $20 billion by 2030. Crazy, right?", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India, right?

{"unnormalised": "But there are definitely challenges too. One big one is cost. A lot of these robots are still pretty expensive, especially compared to manual labor, which is relatively cheap here. Then you have the whole skills gap thing. We need more engineers and technicians who know how to design, build, and maintain these robots. IIT Bombay and IIT Madras are doing some great research, but we need to scale up the education efforts, you know? Someone told me that less than 5% of engineering colleges even have a dedicated robotics course. That’s a huge problem.", "normalised": "But there are definitely challenges too. One big one is cost.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, I'm optimistic. India has the talent and the demand. As costs come down and the skills base grows, I think we'll see robotics playing a much bigger role in everything from manufacturing to healthcare. We might even see robots delivering chai in Mumbai someday!
