{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India, huh? Well, let me tell you, it’s shaping up to be quite the interesting story! I remember back in college, 2010 to be precise, robotics was more of a theoretical concept for most of us. We'd see these fancy robots in Hollywood films and dream about building something similar. My batchmates and I even tried building a small robot to participate in a robotics competition at IIT Bombay, but things didn't quite go as planned, haha!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India, huh?

{"unnormalised": "Cut to today, and it's a totally different landscape. India is slowly, but surely, embracing robotics in various sectors. We’re not just talking about those clunky industrial robots from the 90s. We're seeing some seriously innovative stuff being developed right here in India. Think about agriculture, for example. Farmers are starting to use drones and robotic arms for tasks like spraying pesticides and harvesting crops. This is especially crucial for a country like India, where a large percentage of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihood. The potential for improving efficiency and reducing labor costs is HUGE.", "normalised": "Cut to today, and it's a totally different landscape.

The article mentioned a figure of 20 robots in the next 5 years. That’s a great sign, considering India’s growing population and the need for improved healthcare infrastructure. Robotics could definitely help bridge the gap in terms of providing quality medical assistance, especially in rural areas.", "normalised": "Then there’s the healthcare sector.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are challenges too. One major hurdle is the cost of implementing robotic solutions. Many businesses, especially smaller enterprises, are hesitant to invest in such technologies due to the initial expenses. Another challenge is the lack of skilled manpower to operate and maintain these robots. We need to invest heavily in training programs and educational initiatives to build a strong workforce capable of handling the demands of a rapidly evolving robotics industry.", "normalised": "Of course, there are challenges too.

{"unnormalised": "So, to answer your question, the future of robotics in India is bright. But it requires a concerted effort to overcome the challenges and harness the full potential of this technology. The key is to focus on developing solutions that address the specific needs and challenges of the Indian context. And hey, maybe someday I’ll finally build that robot I dreamt about back in college! I'll probably need to take a few online courses first. Coursera’s robotics specialisation is priced at Rs. 3,500 per month, I believe. Hmm, maybe something to consider.", "normalised": "So, to answer your question, the future of robotics in India is bright.
