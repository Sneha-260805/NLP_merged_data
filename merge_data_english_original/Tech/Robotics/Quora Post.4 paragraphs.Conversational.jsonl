{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India. That's a big question! Honestly, I think it's gonna be huge, yaar. We're already seeing robotics being used in manufacturing, especially in places like Gurgaon and Chennai's auto industries. Think assembly lines, quality control... stuff like that. Companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra are investing a lot.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of robotics in India. That's a big question!

Also, think about robots assisting in surgeries at AIIMS, or even delivering packages in crowded cities like Mumbai. The possibilities are seriously endless.

{"unnormalised": "So yeah, the future of robotics in India? Bright. As long as we invest in the right education and make these technologies accessible. I'd say we're about 5-10 yrs away from seeing really widespread adoption. BTW, has anyone seen that robot barista at CCD yet? Heard it's pretty cool!", "normalised": "So yeah, the future of robotics in India? Bright. As long as we invest in the right education and make these technologies accessible.
