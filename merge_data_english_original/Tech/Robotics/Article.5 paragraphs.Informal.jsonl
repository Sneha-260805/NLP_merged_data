{"unnormalised": "Robotics in India is, well, complicated. On one hand, you see these amazing news stories about ISRO launching rockets, using robotic arms for assembly and testing. Then you hear about start-ups in Bangalore, doing cool stuff with AI and robots for agriculture or healthcare. It's exciting, no doubt. You hear of companies like Sastra Robotics working on industrial automation, and it feels like we're finally getting there. But when you compare it to, say, South Korea or Japan, we're still a bit behind the curve, no?", "normalised": "robotics in india is, well, complicated. on one hand, you see these amazing news stories about I-S-R-O launching rockets, using robotic arms for assembly and testing. then you hear about start-ups in bangalore, doing cool stuff with A-I and robots for agriculture or healthcare. it's exciting, no doubt. you hear of companies like sastra robotics working on industrial automation, and it feels like we're finally getting there. but when you compare it to, say, south korea or japan, we're still a bit behind the curve, no?"}
{"unnormalised": "The issue isn't a lack of brainpower. We have some seriously talented engineers graduating from IITs and NITs every year. The problem is more about funding, infrastructure, and a bit of a risk-averse culture. Companies hesitate to invest heavily in automation, especially in sectors where cheap labor is readily available. Why buy a robotic arm for ₹20 lakhs when you can hire 10 workers for that same amount over a few years? It's a tough call.", "normalised": "the issue isn't a lack of brainpower. we have some seriously talented engineers graduating from I-I-T-s and N-I-T-s every year. the problem is more about funding, infrastructure, and a bit of a risk-averse culture. companies hesitate to invest heavily in automation, especially in sectors where cheap labor is readily available. why buy a robotic arm for rupee twenty lakhs when you can hire ten workers for that same amount over a few years? it's a tough call."}
{"unnormalised": "However, things are starting to shift. The government's \"Make in India\" initiative is pushing for more domestic manufacturing, which naturally leads to more automation. Sectors like logistics and e-commerce, driven by companies like Flipkart and Amazon, are also exploring robotics for warehousing and delivery. I read somewhere that by 2025, the robotics market in India is projected to be worth $5 billion!

{"unnormalised": "But it's not just about industrial robots. There's a huge potential for robots in healthcare, especially in remote areas. Imagine a robot that can assist doctors with surgeries in a village clinic or deliver medicines to patients in hilly regions. Startups are working on this, too. There's one in Pune, that I can't recall the name of at the moment that's working on robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation after strokes!", "normalised": "but it's not just about industrial robots. there's a huge potential for robots in healthcare, especially in remote areas. imagine a robot that can assist doctors with surgeries in a village clinic or deliver medicines to patients in hilly regions. startups are working on this, too. there's one in pune, that i can't recall the name of at the moment that's working on robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation after strokes!"}
{"unnormalised": "So, are we catching up or charging ahead? Maybe a bit of both. We're not quite at the level of some of the global leaders, but the potential is there. With the right investments, a supportive ecosystem, and a willingness to embrace innovation, India can definitely become a major player in the global robotics market. Plus, I really want my robot chai-wallah!
