{"unnormalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the surge in ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Recent incidents, such as the attack on the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant's administrative network (reported on 12/11/2019, though details remain classified), serve as stark reminders of the potential for catastrophic disruption. Furthermore, the widespread use of outdated software and inadequate security protocols across many organizations amplifies the risk. For example, a recent study revealed that over 60% of Indian SMEs are running Windows 7 (EOL as of 14/01/2020) on their primary servers, making them highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities.", "normalised": "One of the most pressing concerns is the surge in ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant threat vector stems from phishing and social engineering campaigns. Attackers are increasingly employing sophisticated techniques, leveraging Indian cultural nuances and linguistic variations to craft highly convincing and personalized phishing emails. These campaigns often target sensitive personal data, financial information, and corporate credentials. A notable example involved a series of phishing attacks impersonating State Bank of India (SBI), enticing users to click on malicious links under the pretext of KYC updates (with reported incidents spiking around Diwali, Nov 4th, 2021). The use of Hindi and regional languages further enhances the efficacy of these attacks, bypassing traditional security filters that are primarily designed to detect English-language threats.", "normalised": "Another significant threat vector stems from phishing and social engineering campaigns.

{"unnormalised": "The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) devices presents another significant challenge. With the burgeoning smart city initiatives and the increasing adoption of IoT-enabled devices in homes and businesses, the potential for large-scale attacks targeting these interconnected devices is growing exponentially. Many IoT devices, particularly those manufactured by smaller, lesser-known companies, often lack basic security features, making them easy targets for hackers. A single compromised IoT device can serve as a gateway to an entire network, enabling attackers to gain access to sensitive data and critical systems. As of 2023, India had an estimated 1.9 billion connected IoT devices.", "normalised": "The rise of I-o-T (Internet of Things) devices presents another significant challenge.

The Indian government has taken several steps to strengthen the nation's cybersecurity posture, including the establishment of the National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC) and the implementation of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Furthermore, initiatives such as the Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning Centre) and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) play a crucial role in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber incidents. CERT-In issues regular advisories and guidelines on cybersecurity best practices, urging organizations to implement robust security controls and conduct regular vulnerability assessments. For example, Advisory CIAD-2023-04-01 details mitigation for critical vulnerabilities in commonly used firewall models, released on Apr 1st, 2023.", "normalised": "Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from both the public and private sectors.
