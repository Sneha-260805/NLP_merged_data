On one hand, you've got companies like TCS and Infosys offering top-notch services, and the govt is pushing for \"Digital India\". But on the other, awareness among regular folks is still pretty low. I mean, how many people still click on dodgy links they get on WhatsApp? A lot, I'm betting. Also, most small businesses don’t even think about cybersecurity until they get hacked. Saw one restaurant get hit with ransomware last year, lost all their data!", "normalised": "Someone asked me about cyber security in India, and honestly, it is a mixed bag.

Like, a power grid in Mumbai got hit a while back, right? And the amount of data being stolen is insane. Personal info, financial details... it's all up for grabs. Even something simple like using \"123456\" as your password (which, sadly, many still do) makes you an easy target. You NEED a strong, unique password for EVERY account. Use a password manager if you have to!", "normalised": "The thing is, cyber threats are evolving fast.
