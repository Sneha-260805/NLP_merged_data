{"unnormalised": "So, I was just reading this report on the cybersecurity landscape in India, and it's honestly quite concerning. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2022, there's been a 12.5% increase in cybercrime incidents compared to the previous year. What's particularly alarming is the rise of phishing attacks targeting UPI users. Many folks are losing ₹5000-₹10000 in a single transaction due to these scams. The CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) issued multiple warnings about vulnerabilities in common softwares like Windows OS and Android versions below 10.", "normalised": "So, I was just reading this report on the cybersecurity landscape in India, and it's honestly quite concerning.
