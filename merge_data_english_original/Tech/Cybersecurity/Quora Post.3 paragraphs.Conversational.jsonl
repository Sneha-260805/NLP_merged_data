Seriously though, with increasing reliance on UPI payments and smartphones, digital safety is super important. First things first, update your OS and apps regularly. I know those update notifications are annoying, but they often include security patches. Think of it like this: if your phone's OS is outdated like Windows XP, hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities.
