It's a multifaceted issue, but I'd say ransomware attacks and phishing scams are right up there. We've seen a surge in cases reported to CERT-In, especially targeting critical infrastructure. Companies need to seriously ramp up their defences, focusing on employee training and robust endpoint protection.", "normalised": "Someone asked me what's the biggest cyber security threat facing Indian companies right now.

{"unnormalised": "One major vulnerability is outdated software. Many firms are still running legacy systems that haven't been patched in yrs, making them easy targets for exploitation. Implementing a zero-trust security model is crucial. Regular security audits, like ISO 27001 certifications, should be conducted, and incident response plans need to be regularly tested and updated. Plus, compliance with regulations like the IT Act, 2000, is non-negotiable.", "normalised": "One major vulnerability is outdated software.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, addressing cybersecurity requires a layered approach. From implementing MFA (multi-factor authentication) and strong passwords to investing in advanced threat detection tools like SIEM solutions. Don't forget the human element, conducting regular phishing simulations to improve employee awareness. Companies should also consider cyber insurance to mitigate potential financial losses from attacks. A single incident can cost a firm upwards of ₹50 lakh, so prevention is definitely better than cure.", "normalised": "Ultimately, addressing cyber security requires a layered approach.
