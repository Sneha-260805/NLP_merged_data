{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I’ve been diving deep into cybersecurity lately, trying to up my game. I'm seeing so many breaches hitting the news, it’s kinda scary. Like, just last month, there was that massive data leak at XYZ Corp, right? Apparently, someone got phished with a simple email - classic mistake, but cost them big time. They lost like 50,000 user records.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I've been diving deep into cybersecurity lately, trying to up my game.

{"unnormalised": "Anyways, I was wondering what you guys think are the best ways to stay safe online in India specifically. We've got some unique challenges, right? Like, a lot of people still use older versions of Windows (think XP or 7) and aren't super tech-savvy. Plus, public Wi-Fi is everywhere, from cafes to railway stations, and it's rarely secure. I connect to the railway station wifi quite often - it's free!", "normalised": "Anyways, I was wondering what you guys think are the best ways to stay safe online in India specifically.

{"unnormalised": "I'm already doing the basics: strong passwords (using a password manager!), 2FA wherever possible, and being super careful about clicking links in emails or SMSes. But I feel like there's gotta be more I can do. I read somewhere that using a VPN on public Wi-Fi is a must. Also, I keep my antivirus updated - I have Norton, which i've been using for the last 5 years.", "normalised": "I'm already doing the basics: strong passwords (using a password manager!), two-F-A wherever possible, and being super careful about clicking links in emails or S-M-Ses.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing I'm curious about is mobile security. I'm using a Redmi Note 10 Pro with MIUI. I know MIUI has some questionable privacy practices, but is it really that bad?
