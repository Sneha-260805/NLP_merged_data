{"unnormalised": "One of the primary threats is phishing. These scams, often disguised as legitimate emails or messages from banks like SBI or telecom providers such as Jio, trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords and OTPs. For example, a user might receive an SMS claiming their SBI account has been blocked and directing them to a fake website. Another rising concern is malware, often spread through infected software downloads or compromised websites. Systems infected with malware can suffer data loss, performance degradation, and even be used as part of a botnet. Staying vigilant and verifying the legitimacy of any communication before taking action is essential. Always double-check the sender's email address and avoid clicking on suspicious links.", "normalised": "One of the primary threats is phishing.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant area is network security. Businesses, particularly SMEs, should implement robust firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Using strong passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) can dramatically reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing can help identify and address potential weaknesses in their systems. Consider engaging a cybersecurity firm for a thorough assessment. Remember, data breaches can result in financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities as stipulated by regulations like the IT Act, 2000.", "normalised": "Another significant area is network security.

Implementing data encryption, both in transit and at rest, is a crucial step. Companies must obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their data, and they should be transparent about how the data will be used. Educating employees about data privacy principles and best practices is also vital.", "normalised": "Data privacy is also paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Mobile security is another area of growing concern. With most Indians using smartphones for online transactions and communication, mobile devices are prime targets for cyberattacks. Users should install antivirus software on their phones, avoid downloading apps from unofficial sources, and be cautious about granting permissions to apps. Regular security updates are also crucial to patch vulnerabilities. For example, the latest Android OS version addresses several security flaws from the 2023 releases.", "normalised": "Mobile security is another area of growing concern.
