{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about passwords. A lot of people still use easily guessable passwords like \"123456\" or their date of birth (e.g., \"01/01/1990\"). Seriously, guys, please don't! Aim for at least 12 characters and use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. A password manager can really help with this; apps like LastPass or Bitwarden are great. Don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If one gets compromised, all are vulnerable.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about passwords.

{"unnormalised": "Next, be super careful about phishing emails. These are designed to trick you into giving away your personal information. A common one in India is pretending to be from your bank (e.g., SBI or HDFC) asking you to update your KYC details. Always check the sender's email address – often, it'll be slightly off (e.g., sbi-online.info instead of sbi.co.in). Never click on links in suspicious emails or SMS messages, especially if they ask for OTPs or card details.", "normalised": "Next, be super careful about phishing emails.

This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or an authenticator app in addition to your password.

It makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.", "normalised": "Two-factor authentication (T-F-A) is your friend. Enable it wherever possible.
