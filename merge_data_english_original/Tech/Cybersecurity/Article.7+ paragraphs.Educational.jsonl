A good password should be at least 12 characters long, incorporating a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols (e.g., P@$$wOrd123!). Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage these complex credentials. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible; 2FA adds an extra layer of security, requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.", "normalised": "Firstly, let us address passwords. \"one two three four five six\" or \"password\" are terrible choices.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, beware of phishing attempts. Phishing is a common tactic used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. These attacks often come in the form of emails, SMS messages, or even phone calls that appear to be legitimate. For instance, you might receive an email claiming to be from \"SBI\" asking you to verify your account details or from “IRCTC” about a ticket cancellation. Always scrutinize the sender's address, look for grammatical errors, and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Remember, legitimate organizations will rarely ask for sensitive information via email or SMS.", "normalised": "Secondly, beware of phishing attempts.
