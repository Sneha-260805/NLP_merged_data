{"unnormalised": "Firstly, consider your trusty smartphone. That shiny device costing upwards of Rs. 25000, holding your entire life – from embarrassing childhood photos to your bank details! Are you using \"123456\" as your password? Bhai, even my nani knows that's weaker than chai without sugar! Opt for a strong password, like \"SharmaJiKaBetaNeverGetsHacked@2024\". Okay, maybe not that long, but you get the idea. And for extra security, enable that fingerprint scanner or face unlock.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's discuss those \"free Wi-Fi\" hotspots. Tempting, aren't they? Especially when your mobile data is slower than a government office during lunch hour. But beware! These networks can be cyber-crooks’ dens. Imagine a hacker sitting in a coffee shop, sipping masala chai, and snooping on your browsing history. Stick to trusted networks or, better yet, use a VPN – consider it your digital \"helmet\" protecting you from online road accidents. My friend Ravi learned this the hard way after his FB account was hacked after logging into a \"Free WiFi\" at Delhi Airport costing him quite a lot of embarrassment.", "normalised": "now, let us discuss those free Wi-Fi hotspots. tempting, aren't they? especially when your mobile data is slower than a government office during lunch hour. but beware! these networks can be cyber-crooks’ dens. imagine a hacker sitting in a coffee shop, sipping masala chai, and snooping on your browsing history. stick to trusted networks or, better yet, use a V-P-N – consider it your digital helmet protecting you from online road accidents. my friend Ravi learned this the hard way after his F-B account was hacked after logging into a free Wi-Fi at Delhi Airport costing him quite a lot of embarrassment."}
