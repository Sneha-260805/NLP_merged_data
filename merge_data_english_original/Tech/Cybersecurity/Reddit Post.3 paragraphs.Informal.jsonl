{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I'm kinda freaking out. My uncle, Rajesh Sharma, keeps clicking on EVERYTHING he sees online. I swear, he thinks every link promising \"Free iPhone 15 Pro Max\" is legit. He's got, like, 5 different antivirus programs installed, all popping up alerts at the same time! And he uses \"123456\" as his password for everything! Seriously, guys, how do I make him understand the importance of cybersecurity? I've tried explaining phishing, but he just says \"Beta, I'm too old to learn these tech things.\" Help!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I am kind of freaking out.

{"unnormalised": "I've already told him not to open emails from unknown senders, especially the ones with subject lines like \"You've won Rs. 1 Crore!\" or \"Urgent: Bank Account Alert!\". I even showed him a YouTube video explaining how scammers operate, but he just shrugged and said, \"Arre, who would want to scam an old man like me?\" I'm worried he's gonna fall for something serious, like a ransomware attack or identity theft. He uses SBI online banking, and I'm terrified someone will get his details. Any tips on how to make this less abstract for him? Maybe show him some real-world examples from India?", "normalised": "I have already told him not to open emails from unknown senders, especially the ones with subject lines like \"You have won Rupee one Crore!\" or \"Urgent: Bank Account Alert!\".

{"unnormalised": "Thinking of installing a password manager for him, but I don’t want him to get overwhelmed. Maybe something really simple, like LastPass? I was also thinking of getting him a course at the local cyber security training center for senior citizens. Also, what’s the best way to check if his computer has already been compromised? Should I run a scan with something like Malwarebytes, or take it to a professional? Any advice appreciated! BTW, his PC is running Windows 7, which I know is a major security risk in 2024.
