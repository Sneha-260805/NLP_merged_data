{"unnormalised": "Also, I live in Bangalore, which is supposedly the IT hub of India. Is it worth trying to attend some bootcamps or offline classes? Are they actually helpful, or just expensive?

I'm a bit of an introvert, so it's not really my thing, but I'm willing to step out of my comfort zone if it's really necessary. Also, are there specific local IT meetups that any of you would suggest?
