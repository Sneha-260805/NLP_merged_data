{"unnormalised": "I'm seeing a lot of hype around Cloud Computing and DevOps. Is it really as big as everyone makes it out to be? I keep getting ads for courses costing Rs. 50,000+ promising \"guaranteed placements\" after just 6 months. Anyone have real-world experience with these bootcamps? Are companies actually hiring people with just that kind of training, or do you still need a solid B.Tech CS background from somewhere like IIT?

I've got a friend who's a data scientist at TCS earning around Rs. 15 LPA after 3 years. Is that the standard, or is he an outlier? Are there other, maybe less hyped, specializations within data that are worth looking into, like maybe focusing on NLP or computer vision?
