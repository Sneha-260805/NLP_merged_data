Last I checked, 4G was the big thing, and now everyone's talking about 5G and \"AI-powered this\" and \"120Hz displays.\" Total tech overload!

Camera's not a huge priority, but something decent would be nice. Battery life is super important tho, gotta last at least 1 day with moderate use.", "normalised": "The problem is, I'm so out of touch with current tech!
