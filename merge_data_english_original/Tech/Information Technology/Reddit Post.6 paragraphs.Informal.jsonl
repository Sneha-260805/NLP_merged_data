Everyone’s talking about AI and ML, and yeah, they're cool, but I'm not sure if it’s the right fit. I have a friend, Rohan, who did a similar degree and now works at TCS, but he seems kinda stuck doing maintenance stuff, not really using the latest tech.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice on my career path.

The other was at a slightly bigger company where I was using Java and Spring Boot. Both were okay, but neither really blew me away.

{"unnormalised": "Right now, I’m thinking about a few options: 1) Front-end development with React, 2) Back-end development with Node.js, or 3) DevOps. Front-end seems interesting 'cause you get to see the results of your work immediately, and React is apparently super in demand. Back-end with Node.js seems solid too, and a friend said there are tons of jobs available. But DevOps is where the $$ is at, right?
