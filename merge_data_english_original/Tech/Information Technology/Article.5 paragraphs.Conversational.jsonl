{"unnormalised": "So, everyone’s talking about the IT boom, right? But mostly, we hear about Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai. What about the smaller cities, the Tier 2 and Tier 3 places like Jaipur, Kochi, or even Guwahati? Are they really benefiting from this digital revolution, or is it just hype? I mean, we see some companies setting up shop, offering salaries starting from ₹25,000, which sounds great, but is it sustainable? Is the infrastructure actually there to support real growth, or are we just seeing a trickle-down effect?", "normalised": "So, everyone’s talking about the I-T boom, right?

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest challenges is definitely talent. While a lot of colleges are churning out graduates, the skills gap is huge. Companies are having to invest heavily in training programs. For example, Infosys just opened a new training center in Mysore with capacity of 10,000 trainees, which is awesome, but it also highlights the problem. We need better curricula in universities and more focus on practical skills. Plus, there's the issue of retaining talent. Many young professionals, after gaining some experience, often gravitate towards the bigger cities for better opportunities and higher pay, often looking at a salary jump to at least Rs. 50,000.", "normalised": "One of the biggest challenges is definitely talent.

{"unnormalised": "Infrastructure is another major hurdle. Reliable internet connectivity is crucial, and while 4G is widespread, 5G rollout is still uneven in many smaller cities. Power outages are also a common occurrence, which can severely disrupt operations. And don’t even get me started on transportation! Imagine trying to commute to work in an auto-rickshaw during peak hour traffic after having to wait 40 mins for one! These issues need to be addressed for IT companies to thrive.", "normalised": "Infrastructure is another major hurdle.

{"unnormalised": "However, there are definitely positive signs. The government’s initiatives like Digital India and the push for e-governance are creating new opportunities in these cities. Also, the cost of living is significantly lower compared to metros, making it an attractive option for companies looking to reduce overheads. Plus, some IT parks are developing in places like Nagpur. Some start-ups are doing pretty well with initial seed funding of Rs. 20 Lakhs.", "normalised": "However, there are definitely positive signs.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, the IT boom in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities is still a work in progress. There are definitely challenges to overcome, but also significant opportunities. It’s not just about replicating the success of Bangalore or Hyderabad, but about creating a unique ecosystem that leverages the strengths of these cities. We need a concerted effort from the government, industry, and academia to make it a reality. Maybe in 5 yrs time we will see a significant change.", "normalised": "Overall, the I-T boom in Tier two and Tier three cities is still a work in progress.
