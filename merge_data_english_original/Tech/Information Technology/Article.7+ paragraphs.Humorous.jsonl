{"unnormalised": "Ah, the world of Information Technology in India. A land of brilliant minds, persistent power cuts, and the art of \"jugaad\"—a uniquely Indian ingenuity that can fix almost anything with a bit of duct tape and a whole lot of hope. If you think Silicon Valley is where the magic happens, you haven't seen an Indian IT professional coax a server back to life with a well-placed prayer and a perfectly timed reboot.", "normalised": "Ah, the world of Information Technology in India.

You will encounter systems with programming languages that went extinct before dinosaurs! Imagine explaining COBOL to a Gen Z intern who thinks assembly language is a type of IKEA furniture. It's like asking a Formula 1 driver to compete in a bullock cart race, but somehow, we manage.

We're not just writing code; we're building bridges across the digital divide, one \"jugaad\" at a time. So, next time you see an Indian IT guy, give them a nod. They're not just fixing bugs; they're mastering the art of technological survival in the most challenging, and hilarious, environment imaginable. And when all else fails, there’s always the trusty Ctrl+Alt+Del. It's the universal solution to almost every problem, IT or otherwise.
