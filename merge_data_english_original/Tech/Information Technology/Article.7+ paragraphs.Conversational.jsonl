{"unnormalised": "Remember those days when owning a PC was a status symbol, and internet access meant trekking to the nearest cyber cafe? Ah, simpler times. But seriously, India's Information Technology (IT) landscape has undergone a mind-blowing transformation. From sluggish dial-up connections to blazing-fast 5G, the journey has been nothing short of spectacular. We've gone from being primarily an outsourcing hub to a nation teeming with innovative startups and a digitally empowered populace.", "normalised": "Remember those days when owning a P-C was a status symbol, and internet access meant trekking to the nearest cyber cafe?

Companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro carved a niche, handling back-end processes and software development for international clients. My dad still reminisces about the days when he worked at HCL, writing code for systems he couldn't even fully understand! He used to tell me the importance of learning COBOL; thank god that trend changed.", "normalised": "Think about it.
