{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm keen to hear your thoughts on the skill gap. A recent NASSCOM report mentioned that ~60% of IT professionals require significant upskilling to meet the demands of emerging technologies. I've also noticed a trend where fresh graduates from Tier-II and Tier-III colleges, even with degrees like B.Tech CS, lack the practical skills required for immediate deployment. They often need extensive training of about 3-6 months at an additional cost of ₹2,00,000 per candidate to the company. Are companies truly focusing on in-house training initiatives? Or is there a preference for hiring already skilled personnel at a premium?", "normalised": "Specifically, I am keen to hear your thoughts on the skill gap.
