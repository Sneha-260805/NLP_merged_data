Now we’ve got AI-powered code assistants like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine that are basically your nerdy coding buddies, except they don’t need chai breaks every 30 mins. They can suggest code snippets, identify bugs, and even write entire functions based on your comments. It's kinda scary, but mostly amazing.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk coding.

Now, AI is being used to detect and prevent these kinds of threats *before* they even happen.
