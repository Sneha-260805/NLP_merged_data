{"unnormalised": "It all started innocently enough, with a broken computer at my father’s small grocery shop in Lucknow. I was, at the time, mostly occupied with delivering chai and helping with the accounts. This old desktop, running Win XP, was crucial for managing inventory, and when it crashed – blue screen and all – panic ensued. My father, bless his heart, threatened to replace it with an abacus.

{"unnormalised": "I remember spending hours at the local cyber cafe, browsing forums and watching YouTube tutorials. Dial-up internet was painfully slow, but I was determined. I learned about boot sectors, corrupted files, and the magic of reinstalling an OS. After what felt like an eternity, I managed to bring that old machine back to life. The sheer joy on my father’s face was enough to hook me. The seed, you see, was planted.", "normalised": "I remember spending hours at the local cyber cafe, browsing forums and watching YouTube tutorials.

{"unnormalised": "From there, my curiosity only grew. I started tinkering with other devices, fixing broken phones, and even building simple websites for friends using HTML. Remember GeoCities? Ah, the memories! My marks in school weren’t stellar – a modest 60% in my 10th boards – but I excelled at anything computer-related. My family and friends started calling me \"The Computer Doctor.\" It felt... good.", "normalised": "From there, my curiosity only grew.

{"unnormalised": "The turning point came when a local IT company, \"TechSolutions Ltd.\", advertised for a junior technician. I barely met the qualifications – a high school diploma and a burning passion – but I applied anyway. To my surprise, I got an interview. Mr. Sharma, the owner, saw something in me, perhaps the same desperate eagerness that had driven me to fix that first computer. He hired me, paying Rs. 5000 a month. A pittance, but it was a foot in the door.", "normalised": "The turning point came when a local I-T company, \"TechSolutions Limited\", advertised for a junior technician.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the cloud revolution. TechSolutions, recognizing the shift in the industry, started offering cloud services.

The learning curve was steep, steeper than the hills of Mussoorie, but I persevered.", "normalised": "Then came the cloud revolution.
