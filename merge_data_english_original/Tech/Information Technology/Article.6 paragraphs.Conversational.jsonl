This offers greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are the big players in this space, and they're constantly innovating and expanding their services. Many smaller businesses are adopting a cloud-first strategy, skipping the traditional server room altogether. This allows them to focus on their core business while leaving the IT infrastructure to the experts.", "normalised": "Cloud computing is another game-changer.
