{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit fam, quick question for all the IT folks out there. Been facing this crazy issue with my laptop for like, the past 2 weeks. Its a Dell XPS 15, got it in Jan'23, so its relatively new. Basically, it keeps crashing randomly with this BSOD error – \"KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE\". I've tried everything the Dell support website suggests, like running the built-in diagnostics (passed everything), updating all the drivers (using Dell Update, not just Windows Update), and even running chkdsk /f. Nothing seems to be working!", "normalised": "Hey Reddit fam, quick question for all the I-T folks out there. Been facing this crazy issue with my laptop for like, the past two weeks.
