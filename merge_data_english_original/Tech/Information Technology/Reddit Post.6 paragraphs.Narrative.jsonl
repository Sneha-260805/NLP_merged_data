You'll hear stuff like \"SRE,\" \"DevOps,\" \"API,\" \"UI/UX,\" \"AWS,\" \"GCP,\" \"Azure\"… and no one will bother to fully explain them. I remember my first week; I just nodded along pretending I knew what everyone was talking about. Google became my best friend, esp. when they'd throw around jargon only understood by ppl with 10+ yrs exp.

You could be a master of Python 3.7, and suddenly everyone's screaming about GoLang or some new JS framework that's all the rage on GitHub.

{"unnormalised": "Salary expectations are something else.
