{"unnormalised": "Cybersecurity is a vital concern in today's interconnected world. Protecting computer systems and networks from cyber threats is essential for individuals and organizations. Common threats include malware, phishing attacks, and ransomware. India's CERT-In (Computer Emergency Response Team - India) is responsible for responding to cybersecurity incidents and promoting cybersecurity awareness. Using strong passwords and keeping software up-to-date are essential cybersecurity practices. Consider using a password manager, and enabling 2FA (two-factor authentication) whenever possible.", "normalised": "Cybersecurity is a vital concern in today's interconnected world.
