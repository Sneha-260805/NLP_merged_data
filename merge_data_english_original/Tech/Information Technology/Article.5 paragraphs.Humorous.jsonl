{"unnormalised": "So, I was happily coding away, fueled by my usual 3 cups of chai (Rs. 30 total, inflation, you know?), when BAM! The server decided to pull a disappearing act. Not just a little hiccup, mind you. A full-blown, \"where did all my data go?\" kind of drama. My first thought? Did a rogue AI finally achieve sentience and decide my code was too boring to exist? Or maybe, just maybe, I’d accidentally pressed the 'Delete Everything' button I swear I’d never even *seen* before.", "normalised": "So, I was happily coding away, fueled by my usual three cups of chai (rupees thirty total, inflation, you know?), when B-A-M!

{"unnormalised": "Turns out, it was neither. After 2 hrs of frantic Googling (yes, I know, a true coder would've figured it out themselves, but cut me some slack, the chai was wearing off!), I discovered it was a classic case of human error. A misplaced semicolon, a forgotten 'if' statement – the usual suspects. You know, the kind of thing that makes you want to throw your laptop out the window and become an auto-rickshaw driver in Goa. But alas, rent is Rs. 25,000/month, so coding it is.", "normalised": "Turns out, it was neither.

He just chuckled, patted me on the back, and said, \"Happens to the best of us. Just don't let it happen again, alright? Deadline's tomorrow.\" Oh, the pressure!

{"unnormalised": "The worst part? This wasn't even the first time. Last month, I accidentally deployed a test build to production. Yup, you read that right. The users got to experience the glory of my half-baked code, complete with hilarious bugs and questionable UI design. The support tickets flooded in faster than monsoon in Mumbai. Let’s just say my performance review wasn't exactly glowing. 7/10, needs improvement. Ouch!", "normalised": "The worst part? This wasn't even the first time.

{"unnormalised": "So, here I am, back to the keyboard, fueled by more chai and a healthy dose of self-deprecating humor. The moral of the story? Save often, double-check your semicolons, and maybe, just maybe, invest in a good backup system. Oh, and always blame the cat. Works like a charm! Now, back to debugging. Wish me luck, folks. I'm gonna need it. Deadline looming, chai brewing, and code…still stubbornly refusing to cooperate.
