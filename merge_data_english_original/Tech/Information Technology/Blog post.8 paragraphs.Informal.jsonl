{"unnormalised": "First up, let's tackle some of the basics. You've probably heard \"RAM\" thrown around like it's the hottest gossip in town. It stands for Random Access Memory, and think of it as your computer's short-term memory. The more RAM you have (say, 8GB or 16GB), the more apps and programs your computer can juggle without slowing down.", "normalised": "First up, let's tackle some of the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the cloud. No, not the fluffy white things in the sky! \"The Cloud\" basically means storing your data on someone else's servers. Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud – these are all examples of cloud storage. Your photos, documents, everything is stored “in the cloud”, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. Pretty neat, huh? You might even hear people mention AWS (Amazon Web Services).", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the cloud.

{"unnormalised": "Security is a BIG deal in IT. \"Firewall\" is like a digital gatekeeper, preventing unauthorized access to your network. Think of it as the bouncer at your favourite club, only letting the right people in. Passwords should be strong and unique, like a secret family recipe guarded with your life! Consider using a password manager to keep them all organized. It’s super important to not fall for phishing schemes, where people send you emails or messages trying to trick you into giving up your information.", "normalised": "Security is a B-I-G deal in I-T. \"Firewall\" is like a digital gatekeeper, preventing unauthorized access to your network.

{"unnormalised": "What is a \"VPN,\" or Virtual Private Network? It creates a secure connection over the internet, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data.
