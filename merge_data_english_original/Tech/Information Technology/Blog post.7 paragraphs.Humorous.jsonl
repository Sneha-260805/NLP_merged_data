The world of Information Technology (IT) can feel like you've accidentally stumbled into a secret society that communicates solely in acronyms and jargon.

{"unnormalised": "First up: **\"The Cloud.\"** Sounds fluffy and ethereal, right? Like something you'd find drifting peacefully above the Himalayas. In reality, it's just someone else's computer. Yep. All that fancy \"cloud storage\" you're paying for? It's sitting on a server, probably humming away in a data center somewhere near Bangalore. So next time someone tells you something is \"in the cloud,\" just picture Rakesh from IT, dutifully backing up your cat photos. Speaking of Rakesh, he said he needs \"2 TB\" of storage for the new server. That’s a LOT of cat pics.", "normalised": "First up: **\"The Cloud.\"** Sounds fluffy and ethereal, right?

{"unnormalised": "Then there's \"bandwidth.\" It's not some cool rock band playing at a pub in Delhi. It’s essentially the size of the pipe that carries your internet data. Think of it like this: a narrow pipe (low bandwidth) means your chai (data) trickles slowly, leading to buffering and frustration. A wide pipe (high bandwidth) means your chai flows freely, and you can binge-watch Bollywood movies without interruption. Pro tip: If your Netflix keeps buffering, yelling at your router won’t help, but complaining to your ISP might. Also, Rakesh wants us to upgrade from the 100 Mbps connection, claiming it’s “bottlenecking the system.”", "normalised": "Then there's \"bandwidth.\" It's not some cool rock band playing at a pub in Delhi.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget \"firewall.\" This sounds like something you'd use to roast marshmallows at a bonfire on Lohri. Instead, it's your computer's bodyguard, keeping out all the nasty viruses and hackers trying to steal your data. A good firewall is essential, especially if you’re prone to clicking on suspicious links promising you’ve won a Maruti Suzuki Swift. It’s like the digital version of locking your house – unless you actually WANT those pesky cyber-burglars waltzing in and messing with your bank account. Remember when that ransomware attack locked all our systems? Good times (not). Cost us ₹50,000 to decrypt the files, and that was just a \"small\" one, according to Rakesh.", "normalised": "And let's not forget \"firewall.\" This sounds like something you'd use to roast marshmallows at a bonfire on Lohri.

{"unnormalised": "Now, brace yourselves for the king of all IT acronyms: **\"API\"**. Application Programming Interface. Say that five times fast. Or, better yet, just remember this: it's the way different software programs talk to each other. Think of it as a translator who helps two people speaking different languages (e.g., your banking app and your payment gateway) understand each other. Without APIs, the internet would be a Tower of Babel, and online shopping would be an absolute nightmare. Rakesh is really proud of the new API he built for our website. I'm just proud he didn't explain it in technical terms.", "normalised": "Now, brace yourselves for the king of all I-T acronyms: **\"A-P-I\"**. Application Programming Interface.

{"unnormalised": "\"Bug.\" It's not just that annoying mosquito buzzing around your head at 3 AM. In the IT world, a bug is a mistake, flaw or defect in the code of a software or a system that cause the system to produce an unexpected or incorrect result or to behave in unintended ways. And while we all try to minimise these “bugs” when developing a product, sometimes they still manage to slip through. Good news? We've hired a new QA Engineer, Rajesh, whose sole job it is to squash these annoying code pests. Hopefully, there won't be any more incidents like the one on 12/01/2023, when the system went offline for 3 hours.", "normalised": "\"Bug.\" It's not just that annoying mosquito buzzing around your head at three A-M.
