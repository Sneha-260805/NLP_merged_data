{"unnormalised": "My initial attempts were disastrous. Syntax errors galore! I remember spending hours trying to get a simple \"Hello World\" program to run, only to be defeated by a misplaced comma or a rogue space. \"Error 404: Brain not found,\" my friends would joke. It was frustrating, but something about the logic intrigued me. The idea that you could give instructions and a machine would actually follow them was kind of magical, even on a monochrome screen.", "normalised": "My initial attempts were disastrous.

{"unnormalised": "My turning point came during a summer vacation. I stumbled upon a book about HTML and web design. Suddenly, computers weren't just about boring commands; they were about creating things, sharing ideas, connecting with the world. I spent hours poring over the book, experimenting with tags, and building my first (hideously designed) website. I even managed to convince my uncle, who ran a small grocery store, to let me create a website for his business. He wasn’t entirely sure what a website was, but he trusted me. I think he paid me ₹500 for the effort.", "normalised": "My turning point came during a summer vacation. I stumbled upon a book about H-T-M-L and web design.
