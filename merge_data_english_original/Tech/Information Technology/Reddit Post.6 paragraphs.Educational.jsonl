{"unnormalised": "But then what does a Tech Lead *actually* do? I see terms like \"architecting solutions\" and \"technical strategy\" thrown around, but what does that mean in practical terms? Are they just glorified project managers who occasionally write a line of code? Do they still get their hands dirty, or are they mostly in meetings arguing about server configurations and database schemas? I’ve seen some posts on Glassdoor saying that the role is mostly about stakeholder management. Is this true?", "normalised": "But then what does a Tech Lead actually do?
