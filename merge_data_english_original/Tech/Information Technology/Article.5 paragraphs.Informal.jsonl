{"unnormalised": "Remember the Y2K scare? It feels like ages ago, but that was a huge turning point for the Indian IT sector. All of a sudden, companies worldwide needed help fixing their systems before the clock struck midnight on 31/12/1999. That's when Indian engineers, especially those from places like IIT Bombay and NIT Warangal, really showed their mettle. We went from being a relatively unknown player to a major force, practically overnight. Companies like TCS and Infosys became household names, even if your aunty couldn’t explain exactly what they *did*.", "normalised": "Remember the Y-2-K scare?

I read an article the other day saying that India is expected to have 1 million AI developers by 2025. That's a massive number! Colleges are scrambling to add AI courses to their curriculum, and online learning platforms like Coursera and Udemy are seeing a huge surge in enrollments for their ML courses. My cousin just signed up for one; he's hoping to land a job at Google or Microsoft (or maybe even start his own AI company!).", "normalised": "Now, everyone's buzzing about A-I and machine learning.

We've got the talent, the ambition, and the drive to be a global leader in the tech world. It will be exciting to see what the next 20 years bring.
