{"unnormalised": "So, you’re trying to navigate the wild world of Indian internet, huh? It's not always a smooth ride, especially if you’re used to blazing fast speeds elsewhere. But fear not, my friend! We've all been there, buffering endlessly while trying to watch that viral Bollywood dance. This is India, where \"net slow hai\" is practically a national slogan. First thing's first: you need to understand the lingo. Words like 'net pack', 'data balance', and the constant anxiety of 'MB khatam ho gaya' will soon become part of your daily vocab. Think of it as a crash course in Jugaad-ing your way through the web.", "normalised": "So, you are trying to navigate the wild world of Indian internet, huh?

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest hurdles? Jargons! You hear about '4G', '5G', 'WiFi', 'broadband' all thrown around. Let's break it down. '4G' is usually what you're using on your mobile phone - it *can* be quick, but speed is heavily reliant on how many other folks are simultaneously streaming the latest IPL match. 5G, while slowly rolling out, promises faster speeds. WiFi is your friend, *if* you can find a reliable source. Many cafes offer it, just remember to ask \"WiFi password kya hai?\" before you order your chai. Broadband is typically what you get at home, often bundled with your cable TV package, from providers like Airtel or Jio.", "normalised": "One of the biggest hurdles? Jargons!

'four G' is usually what you are using on your mobile phone - it can be quick, but speed is heavily reliant on how many other folks are simultaneously streaming the latest I-P-L match. five G, while slowly rolling out, promises faster speeds.

{"unnormalised": "The key is to optimize your usage, boss! Start by turning off auto-play on videos in apps like FB and Insta. Seriously, those things eat up data faster than you can say \"Arey yaar!\". Also, learn to love WiFi. Scope out spots with free WiFi -- Sharma uncle's sweet shop down the road usually has it -- and download those movies and songs for offline viewing. If you're using a mobile hotspot, limit the number of devices connected. Sharing is caring, but not when it comes to precious internet data! Check your data usage regularly via the MyJio app, or the Airtel Thanks app (depending on your provider) so you dont overshoot your 1.5 GB daily limit.", "normalised": "The key is to optimize your usage, boss!

Refresh the page a few times, or try again later. If it persists, check your internet connection or try using a different browser like Chrome or Firefox.
