{"unnormalised": "So, you’ve heard about the internet. Maybe your grandson, Rohan, keeps talking about “memes” and “5G” while you’re just trying to enjoy your chai. Don’t worry, bhai! The internet, despite sounding like some fancy imported gadget, is actually quite simple... in theory. It's basically a giant network where everyone shouts at each other, shows off their lunch photos, and argues about which Bollywood movie is the best. Think of it as a really, really big family gathering, but online. And with cat videos. Lots and lots of cat videos. BTW, don’t believe everything you read online. Someone probably made it up while bored in a Zoom meeting.", "normalised": "so, you’ve heard about the internet. maybe your grandson, rohan, keeps talking about “memes” and “five g” while you’re just trying to enjoy your chai. don’t worry, bhai! the internet, despite sounding like some fancy imported gadget, is actually quite simple... in theory. it's basically a giant network where everyone shouts at each other, shows off their lunch photos, and argues about which bollywood movie is the best. think of it as a really, really big family gathering, but online. and with cat videos. lots and lots of cat videos. b-t-w, don’t believe everything you read online. someone probably made it up while bored in a zoom meeting."}
{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you’ll encounter is “Wi-Fi”. This isn't some exotic Indian sweet (though imagine a Wifi Burfi!), it's just how your devices (like your phone or laptop) connect to the internet wirelessly. You’ll need a password, usually something complicated like \"Rohan'sNewRouter123!\" (with an exclamation mark, naturally). Remember it! Then you might hear about \"URLs.\" These are basically the addresses of websites, like a fancy nameplate on a virtual house. You type them into a “browser” (which is like a virtual auto-rickshaw that takes you to those houses) to get where you want to go. Something like \"www.reallygoodchairecipes.in\" for example.", "normalised": "one of the first things you’ll encounter is “wi-fi”. this isn't some exotic indian sweet (though imagine a wifi burfi!), it's just how your devices (like your phone or laptop) connect to the internet wirelessly. you’ll need a password, usually something complicated like \"rohan'snewrouterone two three!\" (with an exclamation mark, naturally). remember it! then you might hear about \"u-r-l-s.\" these are basically the addresses of websites, like a fancy nameplate on a virtual house. you type them into a “browser” (which is like a virtual auto-rickshaw that takes you to those houses) to get where you want to go. something like \"double u double u double u dot really good chai recipes dot in\" for example."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the glorious world of \"social media.\" This is where people post updates about their lives, often filtered through about 7 layers of editing. Platforms like Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) are popular. Be warned: you *will* see photos of your neighbour’s cousin’s daughter’s vacation in Switzerland. Just smile politely and remember that lighting is everything. Don't get pulled into too many arguments about politics, especially after 9 PM. You need your sleep!", "normalised": "then there's the glorious world of \"social media.\" this is where people post updates about their lives, often filtered through about seven layers of editing. platforms like facebook (f-b) and instagram (i-g) are popular. be warned: you *will* see photos of your neighbour’s cousin’s daughter’s vacation in switzerland. just smile politely and remember that lighting is everything. don't get pulled into too many arguments about politics, especially after nine p-m. you need your sleep!"}
{"unnormalised": "And of course, we can’t forget email. Your email address is your digital identity, something like \"yourname@whatever.com\". People will send you all sorts of things via email: important documents, spam offering you ₹1 Crore, and links to conspiracy theories.
