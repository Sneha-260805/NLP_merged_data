{"unnormalised": "The consultation specifically focuses on Over-The-Top (OTT) services and whether differential pricing should be allowed for specific types of content or applications. Arguments for differential pricing often cite the increased bandwidth demands of services like 4K video streaming (requiring a minimum of 25 Mbps) and the potential for ISPs to offer tailored packages based on user preferences.", "normalised": "The consultation specifically focuses on Over-The-Top (O-T-T) services and whether differential pricing should be allowed for specific types of content or applications.

{"unnormalised": "Industry analysts predict a vigorous debate, with telecom operators likely advocating for greater flexibility in managing network traffic to optimize the user experience and monetize 5G investments. On the other hand, internet freedom activists are expected to strongly oppose any measures that could lead to a tiered internet, potentially stifling innovation and limiting access to information for consumers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.", "normalised": "Industry analysts predict a vigorous debate, with telecom operators likely advocating for greater flexibility in managing network traffic to optimize the user experience and monetize five G investments.

{"unnormalised": "Several stakeholders, including major ISPs like Airtel and Jio, have stated their commitment to upholding net neutrality principles. However, they also emphasize the need for a regulatory framework that allows them to manage the growing demands on their networks effectively, especially with the increasing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications and the rollout of 5G services across the country. The ongoing discussion will undoubtedly influence the evolution of internet services and accessibility for millions of users in India.", "normalised": "Several stakeholders, including major I-S-P-s like Airtel and Jio, have stated their commitment to upholding net neutrality principles.
