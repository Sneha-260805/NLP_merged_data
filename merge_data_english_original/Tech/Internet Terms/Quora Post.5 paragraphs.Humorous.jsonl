I started with the whole \"it's like the size of a pipe\" thing, you know, the one where the bigger the pipe, the more data can flow thru. Then I threw in some jargon like \"Mbps\" (megabits per second) and she just looked at me like I'd started speaking Martian. Turns out, Mbps is just a fancy way of saying how many Bollywood movies you can download at once before your internet crawls slower than a snail doing the naagin dance.", "normalised": "Okay, so I was explaining \"bandwidth\" to my grandmom the other day.
