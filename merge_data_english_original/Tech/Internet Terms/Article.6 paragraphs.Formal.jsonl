{"unnormalised": "One of the fundamental concepts is \"IP address,\" often abbreviated as IP addr. This unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network is essential for routing data. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6, the latter offering a significantly larger address space, is particularly relevant in India, given the rapid growth in internet users and connected devices. Another ubiquitous term is \"Wi-Fi,\" short for Wireless Fidelity. The availability of affordable Wi-Fi hotspots and the expansion of 4G and upcoming 5G networks are transforming connectivity patterns, especially in rural areas where fixed-line infrastructure is limited.", "normalised": "One of the fundamental concepts is \"I-P address,\" often abbreviated as I-P addr.
