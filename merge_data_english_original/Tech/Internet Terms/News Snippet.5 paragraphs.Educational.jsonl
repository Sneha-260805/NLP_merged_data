{"unnormalised": "One of the major hurdles in this transition is the lack of awareness among end-users. Many people are still unfamiliar with terms like \"IP address,\" \"DNS server,\" and the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the transition also requires infrastructural upgrades at the ISP level. Older routers and network equipment might not be compatible with IPv6 and need to be replaced or updated. Airtel and Jio are reportedly investing heavily in these upgrades. Cost is a significant factor for smaller ISPs operating in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Government subsidies and financial assistance could play a vital role in accelerating the adoption rate in these areas.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the transition also requires infrastructural upgrades at the I-S-P level.

{"unnormalised": "The move to IPv6 will also necessitate changes in web hosting practices. Website owners need to ensure that their servers are configured to support both IPv4 and IPv6, often referred to as \"dual-stack\" configuration. Popular web hosting platforms like GoDaddy and Bluehost are already offering IPv6 support, but smaller hosting providers might still lag behind. A potential issue: many legacy websites still use very old versions of PHP or outdated CMS (Content Management Systems).", "normalised": "The move to I-P-v six will also necessitate changes in web hosting practices.

{"unnormalised": "The long-term benefits of IPv6 adoption are undeniable. It provides a virtually unlimited number of IP addresses, ensuring that India can accommodate the rapidly growing number of internet-connected devices. It also paves the way for new technologies and applications that require a more efficient and secure internet infrastructure. Government initiatives like Digital India will undoubtedly benefit from a seamless transition to IPv6 across the nation.", "normalised": "The long-term benefits of I-P-v six adoption are undeniable.
