{"unnormalised": "Let's start with \"bandwidth.\" It's often confused with internet speed, but it's actually the capacity of your internet connection – think of it as the width of a pipe. A wider pipe (higher bandwidth) allows more data to flow through at once. ISPs like Airtel and BSNL advertise different bandwidth packages, often expressed in Mbps (Megabits per second).", "normalised": "Let's start with \"bandwidth.\" It's often confused with internet speed, but it's actually the capacity of your internet connection – think of it as the width of a pipe.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's \"latency,\" sometimes called \"ping.\" This is the delay in data transfer. Gamers and those using video conferencing apps like Zoom or Google Meet are particularly sensitive to latency. High latency means more lag. A good ping rate is generally considered to be below 50ms (milliseconds). Using a CDN can help with latency issues.", "normalised": "Then there's \"latency,\" sometimes called \"ping.\" This is the delay in data transfer.
