{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked what are some common internet terms used in India? Good question! We use a lot of desi-fied versions of standard terms, plus a few unique ones. First off, everyone here knows what \"net banking\" is. Basically online banking, but we call it that. It’s super common, especially with the rise of UPI and all that jazz.", "normalised": "So, someone asked what are some common internet terms used in India? Good question!

Instead of saying \"mobile data plan,\" most people just say \"I need to recharge my data pack.\" You'll hear that phrase everywhere, from your local kirana store offering recharges to your tech-savvy friends. And don’t forget \"OTPs\"! Everyone gets them – for banking, for logging in, for pretty much everything online. Gotta keep those accounts secure, bhai!", "normalised": "Then there's the whole \"data pack\" thing.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, while not unique to India, the usage of \"WiFi hotspot\" is super prevalent. With the internet costs being relatively cheap in most urban locations, folks set up these hotspots where possible to quickly connect their devices like the latest Realme 12 Pro+ 5G or older samsung phones running on Android 10.
