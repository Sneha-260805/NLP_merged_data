{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked what all those internet terms mean, right? Like, what's an \"IP address\" even? Basically, it's like your home address, but for your computer online. Every device connected to the internet – your phone, your laptop, even your smart fridge – has a unique IP address. It's how websites know where to send the data you're asking for. Think of it as the \"return address\" on a letter; without it, the website wouldn't know where you are.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's \"bandwidth\". This is basically how much data can be transferred in a given amount of time. Think of it like a water pipe. A bigger pipe (more bandwidth) means more water (data) can flow through at once. If you're streaming a lot of HD videos or downloading large files, you're using a lot of bandwidth. That's why your internet might slow down if everyone in your family is online at the same time, esp. with Airtel broadband which sometimes throttles bandwidth during peak hours. A good speed test is speedtest.net if you want to check yours.", "normalised": "And then there is bandwidth. This is basically how much data can be transferred in a given amount of time.

It's used to remember things about you, like your login information, preferences, or what items you've added to your cart. Some people worry about privacy with cookies, and there are things like VPNs to help with that.
