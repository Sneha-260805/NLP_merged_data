You're not wrong, but it's kinda like saying \"ATM machine\" - technically correct, but kinda redundant. Back in the day, like '90s internet, the \"www\" was crucial because it told the server *which* service you wanted from the website. Without it, who knows, you might accidentally end up downloading a file on someone's dial-up connection. Horror!

{"unnormalised": "Nowadays, most browsers and websites are smart enough to figure things out without the \"www.\" They automatically redirect you, like a well-trained auto-rickshaw driver in Bangalore who knows exactly where you want to go even if you just mumble vaguely. So, using \"www\" is kinda like still using a floppy disk – nostalgic, maybe, but definitely not necessary. In fact, most modern web developers will tell you that using \"www\" adds unnecessary complexity to your website setup, and they'll likely roll their eyes at you if you insist on keeping it.", "normalised": "Nowadays, most browsers and websites are smart enough to figure things out without the \"W-W-W.\" They automatically redirect you, like a well-trained auto-rickshaw driver in Bangalore who knows exactly where you want to go even if you just mumble vaguely.
