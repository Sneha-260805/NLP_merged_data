{"unnormalised": "So, I was wondering what exactly does \"bandwidth\" mean? I keep hearing it in relation to my JioFiber connection. My internet plan is supposed to give me \"100 Mbps\" but sometimes things are still slow. My brother says it's because we're all streaming different things at the same time. Is that true?", "normalised": "So, I was wondering what exactly does \"bandwidth\" mean? I keep hearing it in relation to my JioFiber connection.

{"unnormalised": "Well, think of bandwidth like a highway for data. The more bandwidth you have (like 100 Mbps), the wider the highway, and the more data can travel at the same time. If everyone in your family is using a lot of bandwidth – say, one person is watching a 4K movie on Netflix, another is playing PUBG online, and someone else is downloading a large file via torrent - then even 100 Mbps might not be enough to go around smoothly. You might experience buffering or lag. It's similar to how traffic jams happen on a real highway.", "normalised": "Well, think of bandwidth like a highway for data.

{"unnormalised": "Plus, sometimes the speed advertised (like 100 Mbps) is a \"theoretical maximum\". Things like the Wi-Fi router, distance from it, or even the time of day can affect the actual speed you're getting. Could be worth running a speed test using \"speedtest.net\" to see what you're actually getting at different times. Also, remember to check your data limit; sometimes \"unlimited\" plans have a \"FUP\" (fair usage policy) after which the speed drops down to something like \"512 Kbps\". Hope this helps!", "normalised": "Plus, sometimes the speed advertised (like one hundred M-B-P-S) is a \"theoretical maximum\".
