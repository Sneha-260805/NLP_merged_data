{"unnormalised": "DDOS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. Essentially, it's a type of cyber-attack where multiple systems flood the target server, website, or network with traffic. Think of it like a traffic jam on a highway. Instead of just one car causing the congestion, you have thousands of cars, making it impossible for legitimate traffic to get through. This can knock a website offline or make it incredibly slow.", "normalised": "D-D-O-S stands for Distributed Denial of Service.

{"unnormalised": "The \"distributed\" part means that the attack originates from many different sources, often computers infected with malware (called a \"botnet\"). These botnets can be controlled by a single attacker or group. So instead of just one computer sending a bunch of requests to a server, you might have 10000+ computers simultaneously bombarding it, which overwhelms the server's resources. This uses up a LOT of bandwidth, maybe upwards of 10 Gbps in some cases.", "normalised": "The \"distributed\" part means that the attack originates from many different sources, often computers infected with malware (called a \"botnet\").

{"unnormalised": "Common internet terms related to DDOS include \"botnet\", \"malware\", \"server\", and \"bandwidth\". There are also acronyms like \"SYN flood\" and \"UDP flood\", which are types of DDOS attacks. Some solutions include using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a DDOS mitigation service.
