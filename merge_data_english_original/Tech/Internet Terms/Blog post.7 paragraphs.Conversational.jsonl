{"unnormalised": "First off, let’s talk about \"bandwidth.\" Think of it like the number of lanes on the highway connecting you to YouTube. More lanes (bandwidth) means more data can travel at once, which translates to smoother streaming and faster downloads. Imagine trying to watch that latest Bollywood blockbuster on a dial-up connection – that’s bandwidth bottleneck at its finest! You might even see bandwidth expressed in units like 100 Mbps, which is more like a 10-lane Mumbai highway.", "normalised": "First off, let’s talk about \"bandwidth.\" Think of it like the number of lanes on the highway connecting you to Y-ou-T-ube.

That’s high latency, my friend. Low latency is the goal—you want that chai (or that webpage) *instantly*. Gamers especially hate high latency; it means the difference between winning and getting fragged in PUBG. A good ping for gaming would be less than 50ms.", "normalised": "Then there's \"latency.\" Latency is the delay, the lag, that momentary pause before the video starts playing.
