Your computer uses the IP address to find the website, but URLs are easier for us humans to remember. You wouldn't tell your auto driver to take you to \"12.34.56.78,\" would you?

{"unnormalised": "What about \"bandwidth?\" Think of bandwidth as the width of a pipe. The wider the pipe, the more water can flow through it. Similarly, the more bandwidth you have, the faster your internet connection. So, if you're trying to watch a 4K movie and it keeps buffering, you probably need more bandwidth.
