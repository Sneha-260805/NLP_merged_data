{"unnormalised": "One frequently encountered term is \"bandwidth.\" Often expressed in Mbps (Megabits per second), bandwidth refers to the data transfer capacity of an internet connection. A higher bandwidth allows for faster download and upload speeds, crucial for activities like streaming videos or participating in video conferences. The quality of one's \"Wi-Fi\" connection, a technology enabling wireless local area networking based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, is directly impacted by bandwidth availability. For instance, a family in Mumbai attempting to simultaneously stream content on 3 devices might experience buffering issues with only 10 Mbps bandwidth.", "normalised": "One frequently encountered term is \"bandwidth.\" Often expressed in M-b-p-s (megabits per second), bandwidth refers to the data transfer capacity of an internet connection.

Rather than storing data locally on a device, cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox allow users to store files remotely on servers managed by third-party providers. This offers benefits like accessibility from multiple devices and enhanced data security. However, concerns around data privacy, particularly regarding compliance with regulations like GDPR, remain a point of contention. Many Indian businesses are wary of trusting sensitive financial information to “the cloud”.", "normalised": "The term \"Cloud storage\" has also gained significant traction.
