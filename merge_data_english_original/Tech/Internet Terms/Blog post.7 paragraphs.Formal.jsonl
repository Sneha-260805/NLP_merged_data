As India embraces digital transformation at an accelerated pace, understanding the fundamental terminology associated with the internet becomes increasingly crucial. This blog post aims to demystify some of the most commonly used internet terms, providing clarity for both seasoned users and those newly initiated into the digital world. In a world where bandwidth constraints are decreasing (with promised speeds of up to 1Gbps through initiatives like BharatNet), it's essential we all understand the playing field.", "normalised": "The internet has become an indispensable part of modern life, permeating every aspect of our existence from communication to commerce.

{"unnormalised": "One of the foundational concepts is the **IP address**, a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. Think of it as the digital equivalent of a physical address, allowing data to be routed correctly across the internet. IPv4 addresses, represented as four sets of numbers ranging from 0 to 255 (e.g., 192.168.1.1), are still in use, but the world is progressively shifting to IPv6, which offers a significantly larger address space due to the limitations of IPv4. It is also important to know about what happens when your IP is blocked.", "normalised": "One of the foundational concepts is the **I-P address**, a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. Think of it as the digital equivalent of a physical address, allowing data to be routed correctly across the internet. I-P-v four addresses, represented as four sets of numbers ranging from zero to two hundred and fifty five (e.g., one hundred and ninety two dot one hundred and sixty eight dot one dot one), are still in use, but the world is progressively shifting to I-P-v six, which offers a significantly larger address space due to the limitations of I-P-v four. It is also important to know about what happens when your I-P is blocked."}
{"unnormalised": "The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is often confused with the internet itself, but it is merely one service that operates over the internet. The WWW is a collection of interconnected documents and resources, accessible via URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). A URL, such as \"https://www.example.com,\" specifies the location of a particular resource on the web. Knowing how this all works means you'll have less trouble setting up an HTTPS connection.", "normalised": "The **World Wide Web (W-W-W)** is often confused with the internet itself, but it is merely one service that operates over the internet. The W-W-W is a collection of interconnected documents and resources, accessible via U-R-L-s (Uniform Resource Locators). A U-R-L, such as \"h-t-t-p-s colon slash slash w-w-w dot example dot com,\" specifies the location of a particular resource on the web. Knowing how this all works means you'll have less trouble setting up an H-T-T-P-S connection."}
{"unnormalised": "Another ubiquitous term is **bandwidth**, which refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given period of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps). Higher bandwidth allows for faster data transfer rates, enabling smoother streaming, quicker downloads, and more responsive online experiences. This is critical for things like video conferencing and online gaming where a lag of even 100ms (milliseconds) can ruin your experience.", "normalised": "Another ubiquitous term is **bandwidth**, which refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given period of time, typically measured in bits per second (b-p-s), kilobits per second (k-b-p-s), megabits per second (M-b-p-s), or gigabits per second (G-b-p-s). Higher bandwidth allows for faster data transfer rates, enabling smoother streaming, quicker downloads, and more responsive online experiences. This is critical for things like video conferencing and online gaming where a lag of even one hundred m-s (milliseconds) can ruin your experience."}
{"unnormalised": "**Cloud computing** has also revolutionized the way we store and access data. Cloud services, such as Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure, offer on-demand access to computing resources, allowing users to store files, run applications, and manage data remotely over the internet. This eliminates the need for expensive on-premise infrastructure and provides greater flexibility and scalability. Many Indian companies are now migrating to the cloud, with estimates putting the cloud market size at $7.1 Billion USD by 2025.", "normalised": "**Cloud computing** has also revolutionized the way we store and access data.

SEO involves various techniques, including keyword research, content optimization, and link building, with the goal of increasing organic traffic to a website. For any business selling online, it is important to pay for SEO to optimize the sales on your website. In India, businesses are now spending approx. ₹ 10,000- ₹ 50,000 per month on SEO.", "normalised": "Finally, **S-E-O (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of optimizing a website or online content to rank higher in search engine results pages (S-E-R-P-s).
