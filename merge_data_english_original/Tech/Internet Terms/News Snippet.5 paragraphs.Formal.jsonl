{"unnormalised": "New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released a consultation paper addressing Net Neutrality concerns regarding the burgeoning field of IoT devices. The paper, released on 16/05/2024, seeks public opinion on whether current internet regulations adequately address the specific challenges posed by the increasing number of IoT devices and services. These devices, ranging from smart home appliances to industrial sensors, are increasingly reliant on internet connectivity and raise questions about data prioritization and potential discrimination.", "normalised": "New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (T-R-A-I) has released a consultation paper addressing Net Neutrality concerns regarding the burgeoning field of I-o-T devices.

{"unnormalised": "The key issues under examination include the potential for ISPs like Jio and Airtel to prioritize certain IoT traffic over others, creating unfair advantages or disadvantages. TRAI is specifically looking into scenarios where \"zero-rating\" practices, where data usage for specific applications or services is not charged to the user, might distort competition within the IoT ecosystem. A section within the consultation paper discusses the potential impact of 5G technology on IoT deployments and the need for adaptive regulatory frameworks.", "normalised": "The key issues under examination include the potential for I-S-Ps like Jio and Airtel to prioritize certain I-o-T traffic over others, creating unfair advantages or disadvantages.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the paper delves into the complexities of defining \"specialized services\" within the context of IoT. There’s a debate whether certain mission-critical IoT applications, such as remote healthcare monitoring systems or industrial automation, should be classified as specialized services, potentially exempt from strict Net Neutrality rules. Some experts believe an exemption would accelerate advancements in these sectors but worry it could also open avenues for abuse. The consultation paper references international best practices from countries like the USA and the EU, analyzing their approaches to regulating IoT and Net Neutrality.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the paper delves into the complexities of defining \"specialized services\" within the context of I-o-T.
