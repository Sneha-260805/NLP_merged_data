{"unnormalised": "So, here I am, sitting in my favourite chai shop, swiping furiously at my phone like a digital dervish. Why, you ask? Because my Wi-Fi at home has decided to go on an indefinite vacation. Again! It's like, one minute I'm happily browsing cat videos on YouTube (720p, naturally), the next, I’m staring at that dreaded \"No Internet Connection\" message. Seriously, ISP folks, is this a feature now? I'm pretty sure my neighbours' connection is rock solid, probably hogging all the bandwidth playing BGMI.", "normalised": "So, here I am, sitting in my favourite chai shop, swiping furiously at my phone like a digital dervish.

Now, it means utter digital isolation, a fate worse than forgetting your mom's birthday (which I did, on 03/03, BTW. Sorry, Amma!).

{"unnormalised": "And don’t even get me started on buffering! It's like the internet is mocking me. I click on a video that's, say, 3 mins long, and spend the next 5 mins watching the loading wheel spin its hypnotic dance. My blood pressure skyrockets, my chai gets cold, and my dreams of viral fame are dashed against the rocks of subpar internet speeds. The advertised 100 Mbps? More like 10 Mbps on a good day, and 2 Mbps when my family is also online. Ugh, #InternetStruggles are real!", "normalised": "And don’t even get me started on buffering!
