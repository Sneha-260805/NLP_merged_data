{"unnormalised": "A Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is a type of cyberattack where multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system, overwhelming it with traffic and rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. Think of it like a traffic jam on the internet highway. Instead of a few cars causing the blockage, you have thousands, even millions, of systems all sending data requests to a single server at the same time. For example, a popular e-commerce site like Flipkart.com could be targeted during a sale on 15/08, leading to a crash.", "normalised": "A Distributed Denial of Service (D-D-O-S) attack is a type of cyberattack where multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system, overwhelming it with traffic and rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

{"unnormalised": "The compromised systems, often referred to as \"bots\" or \"zombies,\" form a botnet, which is controlled by the attacker. The attacker sends instructions to the botnet, directing it to flood the target server with requests. The volume of traffic is so large that the server is unable to handle it, leading to a denial of service. Common targets include websites, online services, and even entire networks. A server with 32 GB of RAM can quickly become unresponsive under a sustained DDOS attack.", "normalised": "The compromised systems, often referred to as \"bots\" or \"zombies,\" form a botnet, which is controlled by the attacker.

{"unnormalised": "Different techniques are used in DDOS attacks, including UDP floods, SYN floods, and HTTP floods. UDP floods overwhelm the target with User Datagram Protocol packets. SYN floods exploit the TCP handshake process. HTTP floods bombard the target with seemingly legitimate HTTP requests. The attacker might use tools like LOIC or HOIC, or even rent botnet services from underground forums for approx. $100 per hr.", "normalised": "Different techniques are used in D-D-O-S attacks, including U-D-P floods, S-Y-N floods, and H-T-T-P floods. U-D-P floods overwhelm the target with User Datagram Protocol packets. S-Y-N floods exploit the T-C-P handshake process. H-T-T-P floods bombard the target with seemingly legitimate H-T-T-P requests. The attacker might use tools like L-O-I-C or H-O-I-C, or even rent botnet services from underground forums for approximately dollar one hundred per hour."}
{"unnormalised": "Mitigation involves using various defense mechanisms, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and content delivery networks (CDNs). These solutions help to filter out malicious traffic and distribute the load across multiple servers. Cloudflare, for instance, offers DDOS protection services. Regularly updating security software and monitoring network traffic for anomalies are also crucial. Ultimately, understanding the nuances of internet terms like \"DDOS attack\" is vital in today's digital landscape, especially for businesses that rely heavily on online presence and availability.", "normalised": "Mitigation involves using various defense mechanisms, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and content delivery networks (C-D-N-s).
