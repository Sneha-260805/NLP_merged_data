{"unnormalised": "Okay, let's break down \"CC\" and \"BCC\" in email communication. \"CC\" stands for \"Carbon Copy\". When you CC someone on an email, you're essentially sending them a copy of the email, and everyone else who receives the email (including those in the \"To\" field and other \"CC'd\" recipients) can see that the person was included. Think of it like making a carbon copy of a document back in the day - everyone knows who else got a copy. It's generally used when you want someone to be aware of the conversation, but they aren't necessarily the primary recipient or required to take action. Example: CC'ing your project lead, Mr. Sharma, when emailing the development team.", "normalised": "Okay, let's break down C-C and B-C-C in email communication. C-C stands for Carbon Copy.

{"unnormalised": "Now, \"BCC\" is short for \"Blind Carbon Copy\". The key difference here is that when you BCC someone, their email address is hidden from all other recipients. No one, except the sender and the BCC'd person, knows that they received a copy. It's useful for maintaining privacy, especially when emailing large groups or when you want to discreetly include someone in the conversation without them being directly involved. Imagine sending a wedding invitation to 200 guests while putting all the email addresses in BCC instead of CC to keep the email addresses private.", "normalised": "Now, B-C-C is short for Blind Carbon Copy.

{"unnormalised": "In short, use CC when transparency is important and you want everyone to know who else is in the loop. Use BCC when you need to protect someone's privacy or when you want to include someone without alerting the other recipients. Hope this clears things up!
