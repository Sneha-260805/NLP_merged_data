{"unnormalised": "Well, AI's future in India looks pretty bright, tbh. We're already seeing AI pop up everywhere, from agriculture to healthcare. Think about it - AI-powered tools helping farmers predict crop yields or diagnose diseases. In education, personalized learning platforms powered by AI are becoming more common, helping students learn at their own pace. And let's not forget the e-commerce sector, where AI is used for everything from product recommendations to fraud detection. Startups are booming - I saw an article about 50+ AI startups in Bangalore alone! The government's also pushing for AI adoption with initiatives like \"AI for All,\" targeting widespread AI literacy by 2025.", "normalised": "Well, A-I's future in India looks pretty bright, to be honest.

{"unnormalised": "The challenges are real too. Data privacy is a big concern, especially with all the data AI needs to function effectively. We need robust regulations like the proposed Data Protection Bill to ensure ethical AI development and deployment. Another challenge is the lack of skilled AI professionals. India needs to invest heavily in AI education and training to bridge the skills gap. It's predicted we'll need 1 million+ AI professionals by 2030 to truly take advantage of the AI revolution. Then, there's the question of bias in AI algorithms. If the data used to train AI systems reflects existing biases in society, the AI will perpetuate those biases.", "normalised": "The challenges are real too.

{"unnormalised": "So, the future of AI in India is exciting, but it requires careful planning and execution. We need to address the challenges of data privacy, skills gap, and algorithmic bias to ensure that AI benefits everyone. Keep an eye out for developments coming out of IIT Delhi and IIIT Hyderabad; they're doing cutting-edge research. I'm optimistic that India can become a global leader in AI.", "normalised": "So, the future of A-I in India is exciting, but it requires careful planning and execution.
