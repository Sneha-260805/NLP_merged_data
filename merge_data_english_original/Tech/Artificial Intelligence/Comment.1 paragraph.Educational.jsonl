{"unnormalised": "AI/ML is transforming sectors like healthcare, e.g., diagnosing diseases faster using algorithms. However, training these models needs massive datasets, often involving techniques like GANs. The ethical considerations around data privacy, bias in algorithms (e.g., favoring certain demographics in loan applications, leading to societal disparities), and job displacement are also major concerns. Remember that 90% accuracy doesn't mean the model is always correct; it's crucial to understand the error rate and its implications in real-world scenarios. Plus, understanding GPU requirements (like needing NVIDIA Tesla V100) is key for developers aiming to train complex AI models.", "normalised": "A-I slash M-L is transforming sectors like healthcare, for example, diagnosing diseases faster using algorithms.
