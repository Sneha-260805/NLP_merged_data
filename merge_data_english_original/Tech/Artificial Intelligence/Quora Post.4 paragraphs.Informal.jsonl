We're already seeing it everywhere, from agriculture to healthcare. Think about it – farmers in Punjab using AI-powered apps to predict the best time to sow their crops. That's real impact, folks! And in healthcare, AI's helping doctors in places like AIIMS diagnose diseases faster using image recognition, like spotting TB from x-rays, which is a huge deal.", "normalised": "Okay, so I keep seeing this question pop up: \"Is A-I actually useful in India?\" and to be honest, the answer is a big, fat YES!

Also, there's the skills gap. We need more people trained in AI to really take advantage of its potential.
