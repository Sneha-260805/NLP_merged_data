{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some resources I've found helpful for understanding AI, especially if you're just starting out. It can be a bit overwhelming with all the jargon, like CNNs and RNNs, but don't let that scare you off! There are some fantastic online courses on platforms like Coursera and edX. I'd recommend Andrew Ng's course, it's a classic. Also, check out TensorFlow's official website; they have great tutorials even for beginners. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is an AI model!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some resources I have found helpful for understanding A-I, especially if you are just starting out.

{"unnormalised": "One thing I found particularly useful was focusing on specific areas of AI. For example, instead of trying to learn everything at once, I started with Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are libraries like NLTK in Python that make it easier to get your hands dirty. Then, I moved onto computer vision. Again, breaking things down makes it less daunting. Don't hesitate to join online communities like r/MachineLearning or Stack Overflow if you get stuck. People are generally very helpful. Also, look into Kaggle competitions; even if you don't win, you learn a lot just by participating.", "normalised": "One thing I found particularly useful was focusing on specific areas of A-I.

Issues like bias in algorithms are crucial, and it's our responsibility as future AI developers to address them. There are some excellent books on this topic, like \"Weapons of Math Destruction\" by Cathy O'Neil. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and most importantly, use AI for good!
