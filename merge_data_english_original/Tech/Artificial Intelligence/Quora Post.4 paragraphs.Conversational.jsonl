{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of AI in India. It's a pretty interesting question, and honestly, there's a lot of hype, but also real potential. I think we're gonna see AI integrated into everything, from agriculture to healthcare. My cousin works at TCS and he says they're already using AI to predict crop yields – apparently, they're getting around 15% better accuracy.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the future of A-I in India.

{"unnormalised": "Healthcare is another big one. Imagine AI helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier. I read somewhere that AIIMS is experimenting with algorithms to detect cancer from MRI scans. And think about customer service! No more waiting 30 mins on the phone – AI chatbots could handle a lot of the routine stuff. Someone told me that HDFC Bank is testing an AI system for handling customer queries... They are saying it will reduce wait times by 50%.", "normalised": "Healthcare is another big one.

{"unnormalised": "But there are also challenges, right? Data privacy is a huge concern. We need to figure out how to use AI ethically and responsibly. And there's the whole job displacement thing. What happens when AI can do the work of, say, 10 people? The govt. needs to think about retraining programs and creating new opportunities. One recent report mentioned 2 million jobs could be at risk.", "normalised": "But there are also challenges, right? Data privacy is a huge concern.
