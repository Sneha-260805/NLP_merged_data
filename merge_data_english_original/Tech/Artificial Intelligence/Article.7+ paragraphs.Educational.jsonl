Companies are deploying AI-powered drones and sensors to monitor soil conditions, identify plant diseases, and predict weather patterns. This data enables farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, leading to increased productivity and reduced waste. For example, AI applications can analyze satellite imagery to assess crop health and provide real-time recommendations. A report from the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that AI interventions can boost agricultural output by 15-20%.", "normalised": "In agriculture, A-I is assisting farmers in optimizing crop yields and managing resources more efficiently.
