{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I just had a pretty wild experience with this new AI tool my friend showed me. He said it's gonna \"revolutionize everything\", lol, typical tech bro hype. But honestly? It kinda blew my mind. It's a language model, like, supercharged. I gave it a prompt: \"Write a short story about a chaiwala in Mumbai who discovers he can predict the future using AI\". I expected some generic garbage, but it came back with this super detailed, emotionally resonant story, complete with accurate street names in Bandra and even the price of chai (₹12). I'm still kinda freaked out by it.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I just had a pretty wild experience with this new A-I tool my friend showed me.

{"unnormalised": "The thing that got me was how Indian it felt. Like, it wasn't just throwing in a few Hindi words; it understood the nuances of Mumbai life. It even mentioned the Ganesh Chaturthi processions and the constant traffic jams near Linking Road. My friend said it was trained on a massive dataset of Indian text and images, which explains the cultural understanding. He also mentioned something about the model using 16GB of VRAM and requiring a CUDA version >= 11.0, whatever that means. All I know is, it's way better than any AI I've messed with before.", "normalised": "The thing that got me was how Indian it felt.

Any suggestions on what type of story prompt or test I can give the AI? I’m thinking of seeing if it can write code for some common financial formulas, maybe something involving calculating returns on SIP investments with a projected annual growth of 12.5%.
