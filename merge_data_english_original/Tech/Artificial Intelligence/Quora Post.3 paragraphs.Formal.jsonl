{"unnormalised": "Is AI really going to take our jobs? It's a question I've been asked countless times, especially after the release of models like GPT-4 and the proliferation of AI-powered tools. The short answer? It's complicated. While AI *will* undoubtedly change the job market, the narrative of complete replacement is, in my opinion, overly simplistic. Consider the impact of automation in manufacturing. Did it eliminate factory jobs entirely? No, it shifted the skillsets required and created new roles in areas like maintenance and programming. I believe AI will follow a similar trajectory.", "normalised": "Is A-I really going to take our jobs?

Data entry clerks, for example, might see their responsibilities significantly reduced or automated by sophisticated AI systems. However, this also frees up human workers to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors. Imagine marketing teams leveraging AI for initial content drafts but relying on human expertise to refine and tailor the message for specific audiences in India. Moreover, the development, maintenance, and ethical oversight of these AI systems will create a surge in demand for skilled professionals in fields like AI engineering, data science, and AI ethics. Perhaps, in the future, we might see AI ethics consultants commanding fees of ₹5000 per consultation.", "normalised": "For instance, roles involving repetitive tasks are clearly at risk.

Critical thinking, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence are areas where humans are likely to retain a significant advantage. Investing in upskilling initiatives, particularly in areas like data literacy and AI fluency, will be crucial for individuals and organizations alike. The key is not to fear AI but to embrace it as a powerful tool that can augment our abilities and create new opportunities, even if it means pursuing a 6-month AI certification course from NIIT.", "normalised": "Ultimately, navigating the A-I revolution requires adaptation and a focus on developing uniquely human skills.
