Well, let me tell you, as a software engineer sweating deadlines in Bangalore, I’ve thought about this more than I care to admit! Jokes aside, AI is definitely changing the landscape. I mean, even I'm using ChatGPT v4 to debug my code now (don't tell my manager!). But will it completely replace us? I'm not so sure. Remember how everyone thought computers would eliminate paper?

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, AI, especially these fancy new models, still needs a lot of hand-holding. They're great at churning out code snippets or summarizing reports, but they can also go completely off the rails. I once asked an AI to generate a marketing slogan and it came up with \"Buy our product, or else!\". Not exactly catchy, right? Plus, all this talk about AI, and my internet speed from Airtel is still barely 2Mbps!
