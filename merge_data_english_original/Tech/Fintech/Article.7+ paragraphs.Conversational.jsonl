{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest game-changers has been UPI. Think about it: just a few yrs ago, paying a roadside vendor meant fumbling for cash. Now, you can just scan a QR code using apps like PhonePe or Google Pay & transfer Rs. 20 instantly. It's become so ingrained in our daily lives that it's hard to imagine doing without it. And it's not just small transactions; many businesses now accept UPI for larger payments too.", "normalised": "One of the biggest game-changers has been U-P-I.

{"unnormalised": "But UPI is just the tip of the iceberg. We're also seeing a surge in online lending platforms. Companies like KreditBee are offering personal loans with minimal paperwork. While this can be a lifesaver in a financial crunch, it’s crucial to understand the terms and conditions carefully. The interest rates on these loans, often quoted as a monthly percentage (e.g., 1.5% p.m.), can quickly add up. Make sure you do the maths and understand the total cost of borrowing before signing on the dotted line.", "normalised": "But U-P-I is just the tip of the iceberg.

{"unnormalised": "Another area gaining traction is digital investment platforms. Apps like Groww and Zerodha are making it easier than ever to invest in stocks, mutual funds, and even US stocks. You can start with as little as Rs. 500 per month in a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). However, remember that investing always carries risk. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, and consider consulting a financial advisor before making any major investment decisions. Mr. Sharma, a friend of mine, uses Zerodha and has seen decent returns.", "normalised": "Another area gaining traction is digital investment platforms.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about some potential pitfalls. While fintech offers numerous benefits, it's not without its risks. One major concern is data security. With so much of our financial information stored online, it's vital to choose platforms with robust security measures. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption. Also, be wary of phishing scams and fraudulent apps. Always download apps from official app stores and never share your OTP (One-Time Password) with anyone. My neighbour almost lost Rs 50000 to a phishing scam.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about some potential pitfalls. While fintech offers numerous benefits, it's not without its risks.
