{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, lately, I've been hearing a LOT about \"Fintech.\" I mean, seriously, every other startup these days seems to be claiming to be a Fintech disrupter. But honestly, sometimes I wonder if it's just fancy jargon or if there's some serious innovation actually happening. Let's be real, navigating the world of finance in India can be a pain. Remember the days of endless queues at SBI for even the smallest transaction? Urgh!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "One area where Fintech is definitely making a mark is in investments. Apps like Groww and Zerodha are making it easier for young Indians to start investing in the stock market. But, of course, you still need to do your homework. Don't just blindly follow tips from some random \"investment guru\" on Telegram. Seriously, some people on those groups can be downright dodgy. One group I saw wanted me to pump 10000 INR into this stock I'd never even heard of.
