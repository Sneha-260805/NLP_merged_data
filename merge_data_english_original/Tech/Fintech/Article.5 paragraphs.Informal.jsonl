The convenience factor is a game-changer.

Fintech companies are developing solutions to reach underserved communities, providing access to credit and financial services that were previously unavailable. Think of it – farmers in remote villages in Bihar using mobile apps to check crop prices and access micro-loans! It’s a huge step towards financial inclusion.
