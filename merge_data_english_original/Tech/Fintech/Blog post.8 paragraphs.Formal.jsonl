{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent trends is the surge in digital payments. UPI transactions crossed INR 10 trillion in value in March 2024 alone, showcasing the widespread adoption of platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm. However, user behavior often reflects unnormalized expressions like “Rs. 500” instead of “five hundred rupees” or abbreviated terms like “UPI” instead of “Unified Payments Interface” in everyday conversations and transactions. This informal language underscores the need for robust normalization models in fintech applications.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent trends is the surge in digital payments.
