I still remember the day my grandmother, a staunch believer in cash and traditional banking, received a notification on her basic Nokia phone – a message from her son in Mumbai saying he’d sent her Rs. 5000 via Paytm. She was bewildered. \"Pay…what now?\" she asked, squinting at the screen. My attempt to explain the wonders of UPI and digital wallets felt like teaching calculus to a parakeet. That was my first real taste of the challenge, and the potential, of fintech in India.", "normalised": "The year was two thousand and eighteen.

It’s a remarkable transformation, driven by innovative fintech startups who have addressed uniquely Indian needs. Remember the early days of online shopping? COD (cash on delivery) was king! Nobody trusted online payments. Now, UPI transactions are ubiquitous, facilitated by players like PhonePe and BharatPe. The shift has been seismic, largely due to the convenience and accessibility offered.", "normalised": "Fast forward to today, and even my grandmother uses P-A-Y-T-M to pay the doodhwala (milkman) and the local kirana store.

He manages his entire investment portfolio through Zerodha, using algo-trading strategies he learned online.

He excitedly told me about using a QR code reader on his phone, but then confessed he didn't understand how to reconcile his daily earnings. He just saw a number in his bank account! Digital literacy remains a critical hurdle.
