{"unnormalised": "So, I'm a small business owner in Bangalore, running a chai stall near Manyata Tech Park. For years, I've relied heavily on UPI payments – Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe, the works. It's convenient for everyone, especially my customers. But lately, with inflation and rising wholesale prices, my daily transactions are getting bigger. I’m finding the default transaction limit of Rs. 1,00,000 (1 lakh) is often insufficient.", "normalised": "So, I'm a small business owner in Bangalore, running a chai stall near Manyata Tech Park.

{"unnormalised": "I've contacted my bank, ICICI, multiple times to request an increase. Initially, I thought it would be a straightforward process, providing the necessary documentation like my GST registration and Aadhar card. I even offered to pay any associated fees. However, the response has been surprisingly resistant. They're citing RBI guidelines and risk assessment protocols as reasons for their reluctance.

{"unnormalised": "What's frustrating is seeing bigger businesses, like D-Mart and Reliance Fresh, seamlessly accepting large UPI payments. It feels like the system is designed to benefit large corporations, while small-scale entrepreneurs like myself are left struggling. I need to be able to reliably accept transactions up to, say, Rs. 2,00,000 (2 lakh) per day without constantly worrying about hitting the limit. It affects my business, causes delays, and honestly, makes me look unprofessional.", "normalised": "What's frustrating is seeing bigger businesses, like D-Mart and Reliance Fresh, seamlessly accepting large U-P-I payments.

{"unnormalised": "AITA for thinking my bank should be more accommodating, considering my needs as a legitimate business owner and the increasing reliance on digital payments in India? I see others accepting UPI payments without a hitch, so why is ICICI giving me such a hard time? Is it unreasonable to expect a slightly higher transaction limit in today's economy? Any advice from fellow small business owners dealing with similar issues would be greatly appreciated!", "normalised": "Am I the A for thinking my bank should be more accommodating, considering my needs as a legitimate business owner and the increasing reliance on digital payments in India?
