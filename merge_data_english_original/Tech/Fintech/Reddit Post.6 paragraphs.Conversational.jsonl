My friends keep talking about investing in IPOs, but I don’t know what to expect. Any recommendations for a newbie? Or should I just stick to good old fixed deposits at SBI for now? My gut says FD is the safest bet.", "normalised": "Specifically, I'm interested in the whole 'investment apps' scene. There are so many! Groww, Zerodha, Upstox... it's kinda overwhelming.
