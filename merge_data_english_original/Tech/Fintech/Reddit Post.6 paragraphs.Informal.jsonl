{"unnormalised": "I’m kinda wary tho. Seen a bunch of articles online about people losing money on these apps, especially with all the IPO hype and stuff.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about the security of these apps? I mean, we're talking about sensitive financial info here. Do these platforms really have top-notch security? My friend was telling me about RBI guidelines and stuff, but honestly, it's all Greek to me. Should I be worried about my Aadhaar details being compromised or something? What kind of two-factor authentication is actually safe? Some of them use SMS OTP which I hear isn't the best.", "normalised": "Also, what about the security of these apps?

Is it something I can easily handle myself, or should I just hire a CA?

{"unnormalised": "I'm also a bit confused about demat accounts. All these apps keep saying you need one, but is it the same thing as a bank account? Or are they totally separate?
