It's the wild, wild west of finance, except instead of cowboys and saloons, we've got hoodies, laptops, and enough jargon to make your head spin faster than a ceiling fan in a Chennai summer. As someone who's tripped over more digital rupees than I care to admit, let me be your slightly sarcastic, yet ultimately helpful, guide through this brave new world.", "normalised": "So, you've heard the siren song of Fintech, huh?

{"unnormalised": "First off, let’s address the elephant in the room: the acronyms. Seriously, it's like alphabet soup on steroids. We've got UPI, RTGS, NEFT, KYC, AML, and enough others to form a small country. It's all designed to make your life easier, supposedly. But honestly, sometimes I feel like I need a PhD in Fintechanese just to transfer Rs. 500 to my mom.", "normalised": "First off, let’s address the elephant in the room: the acronyms.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the constant barrage of \"disruptive\" innovations. Every week, it seems, there's a new app promising to revolutionize the way we handle our paisa. \"Invest like a pro!\" they scream. \"Get rich quick!\" they whisper. Usually, it involves some combination of AI, blockchain, and a whole lot of hope. The reality? More often than not, it ends with you scratching your head and wondering where your money went. Kind of like that time I tried to day trade based on a tip from my cousin, the self-proclaimed \"stock market guru.\" Let’s just say, I learned a valuable lesson about diversification. The hard way.", "normalised": "Then there's the constant barrage of \"disruptive\" innovations.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of investments, have you noticed how every Fintech company is now your best friend, offering personalized investment advice? It's all very chummy and reassuring, until you realize their \"algorithm\" is basically suggesting the same three mutual funds to everyone in your uncle's WhatsApp group. And the fees? Let's just say, they're not always as transparent as that perfectly polished website leads you to believe.

{"unnormalised": "The onboarding process can be a comedic masterpiece, especially the KYC part. You'd think opening a bank account would involve less paperwork than launching a rocket into space. But no, Fintech companies want your Aadhaar card, your PAN card, your birth certificate, your grandmother's maiden name, and a blood sample, just to make sure you're not secretly a Nigerian prince trying to launder money through their platform.

{"unnormalised": "So, is Fintech the future? Maybe. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it’s definitely entertaining. Just remember to keep your wits about you, read the fine print, and never, ever, trust a financial advisor who promises you guaranteed returns.
