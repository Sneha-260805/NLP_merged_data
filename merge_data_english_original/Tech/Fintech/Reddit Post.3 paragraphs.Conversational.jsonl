There's this one app, \"PayKaro,\" that's advertising like crazy, claiming they give 10% cashback on everything. Sounds sus, tbh. Anyone else tried it? Also, are UPI transaction limits of ₹1 lakh still a thing? I keep hitting that wall when I'm trying to send money to my bhai for rent.", "normalised": "So I've been diving into the world of fin-tech startups in India lately, and it's kind of wild.

I'm thinking of putting in ₹10,000 to test the waters, but I'm worried about the risks. Are they regulated by RBI? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
