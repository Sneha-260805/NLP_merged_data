Now, you can do all that from your phone in minutes. My cousin, Ravi, runs a small kirana store in Lucknow. He used to spend hours each week dealing with cash transactions and chasing payments. Now, almost everyone pays him through PhonePe or Google Pay. He says it's saved him so much time and hassle. He's even started offering digital credit to his regular customers!", "normalised": "Think about it: just a few years ago, most people were lining up at the bank to deposit cash or waiting weeks for a loan approval.

Initiatives like the Jan Dhan Yojana have helped millions of people open bank accounts, and UPI has revolutionized the way people transfer money.

She even remembers her UPI PIN number! Which is frankly, more than I can say for myself sometimes.", "normalised": "Then there's the government's push for financial inclusion.

Cybersecurity is a huge concern, especially as more and more people start using digital financial services.
