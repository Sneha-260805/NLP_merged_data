{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I just gotta rant about all these new-fangled fintech apps my cousin Deepak keeps shoving down my throat.

Sounds great in theory, but try explaining to Sharmaji, who's been brewing the best chai in Chembur for 30 years, how to use a QR code. Last I checked, his \"digital literacy\" consisted of knowing which button to press on his old Nokia phone to answer a call.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on the crypto craze. Deepak keeps telling me I'm missing out on \"generational wealth\" by not investing in DogeCoin or Shiba Inu. He showed me a chart with lines going up like a rocket, promising 1000% returns in just 2 weeks. I asked him if that included brokerage fees (0.05% per trade, BTW), and he just mumbled something about \"long-term hodling.\" Frankly, I'd rather put my money in a fixed deposit at SBI. At least I know I'll get *some* kind of return, even if it's just enough to buy a decent samosa.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on the crypto craze.
