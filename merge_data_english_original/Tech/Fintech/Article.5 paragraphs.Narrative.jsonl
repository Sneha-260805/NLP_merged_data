It was Diwali season, 2016, and the shop was overflowing. Not just with customers, but with cash – stacks of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, creating a logistical nightmare. My dad, usually a picture of calm, was visibly stressed managing the accounts and the digital wallets requests. He was using 3 different QR codes for Paytm, Freecharge & Phonepe, and it was all just too much. That’s when it hit me: a single, unified payment solution for small merchants like him.", "normalised": "The idea for \"BharatPay,\" as I called it in my head back then, sparked during a particularly frustrating visit to my parents’ Kirana store in Chandni Chowk.

{"unnormalised": "I remember scribbling down the initial concept on a chai-stained napkin that very evening. It wasn't just about consolidating payment methods; it was about simplifying financial transactions for the millions of small businesses that formed the backbone of India's economy. The challenges were daunting. How do you convince shopkeepers, many still wary of technology, to embrace a new system? How do you build trust in a digital platform in a country where cash is king? The MVP was built in 6 weeks from that date.", "normalised": "I remember scribbling down the initial concept on a chai-stained napkin that very evening.

{"unnormalised": "The early days were a grind. I spent countless hours traveling across Delhi, from Sadar Bazaar to Lajpat Nagar, pitching BharatPay to skeptical shop owners. \"Another app?\" they'd scoff. \"What's wrong with cash, bhai?\" But slowly, as they saw the convenience – the ease of tracking transactions, the reduced risk of theft, and the potential to reach a wider customer base – they started to come around. The turning point came when we integrated UPI payments; our transaction volume jumped by 300% in that month.", "normalised": "The early days were a grind.

He was initially hesitant, but after seeing how BharatPay simplified his accounting and reduced his dependency on change, he became our biggest advocate, convincing other vendors in the area to adopt it. I saw him last week and he told me he finally managed to buy a small flat in Dwarka with all the savings he had made. Moments like those, the tangible impact on people's lives, are what keep us going.", "normalised": "One particularly memorable incident involved a tea stall owner near A-I-I-M-S.

We are now working on expanding into rural markets, bringing digital financial services to even the most remote corners of India, by 2025. From that chai-stained napkin to a nationwide platform, it's been an incredible journey. Our Series B funding round is happening on 15/08.
