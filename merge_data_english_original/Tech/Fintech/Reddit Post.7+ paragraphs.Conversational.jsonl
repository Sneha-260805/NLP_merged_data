{"unnormalised": "First off, what are some of the legit players? I keep seeing ads for platforms offering loans in like, 5 mins. Seems kinda sus, especially when they're asking for Aadhaar no. upfront. Are companies like Paytm and PhonePe actually profitable, or are they just burning VC money like crazy? I read an article saying Paytm's losses were ₹1,700 cr last year. Yikes!", "normalised": "First off, what are some of the legit players?
