Did you know, in FY23, UPI processed over 84 billion transactions worth ₹139 trillion? That's insane growth! And it’s not just the big players like PhonePe and Google Pay; smaller regional apps are popping up, offering niche services.", "normalised": "First off, U-P-I (Unified Payments Interface) is the backbone.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the rise of neobanks. These are basically banks without physical branches, operating entirely online. Think Fi Money, Niyo, and Jupiter. They offer slick interfaces and often tie-up with traditional banks like SBM Bank India for regulatory compliance. They target the digitally savvy crowd, offering features like instant account opening and better interest rates on savings (some offer up to 7% p.a.!). But remember, they are still relatively new, so do your research before parking a large amount of your savings.", "normalised": "Then there's the rise of neobanks.

{"unnormalised": "Another area to watch is P2P lending (peer-to-peer lending). Platforms like Faircent and Lendbox connect borrowers directly with lenders, cutting out the traditional bank middleman. This can offer borrowers lower interest rates and lenders potentially higher returns. However, it's also higher risk. Always check the NBFC registration and understand the risks involved. I'd suggest starting small, maybe investing ₹5000-₹10000 to get a feel for it.", "normalised": "Another area to watch is P-to-P lending (peer-to-peer lending).

{"unnormalised": "AI and machine learning are also playing a bigger role. Fintech companies are using AI to detect fraud, personalize financial advice, and automate various processes. Robo-advisors are becoming increasingly popular, offering automated investment advice based on your risk profile. Apps like Groww and Zerodha use algorithms to suggest investment options, but remember, they are not foolproof. Always do your own due diligence before investing in anything.
