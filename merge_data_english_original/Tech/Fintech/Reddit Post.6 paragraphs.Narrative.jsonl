Promised like, 20% returns in a month on your investments. I mean, come on! Reminded me of that whole Speak Asia thing back in '08.

{"unnormalised": "Anyways, I’m a techie, right? So, naturally, I downloaded the app. The UI was slick, I’ll give them that. All fancy animations and stuff. They were offering initial investments starting at Rs. 500. KYC was simple - Aadhaar card no. and a selfie. That’s where my alarm bells started ringing. Too easy, ya know?", "normalised": "Anyways, I’m a techie, right? So, naturally, I downloaded the app. The U-I was slick, I’ll give them that. All fancy animations and stuff.
