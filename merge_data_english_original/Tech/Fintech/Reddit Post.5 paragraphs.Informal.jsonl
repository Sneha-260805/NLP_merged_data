{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I've been diving deep into the world of Fintech startups in India lately, and it's kinda blowing my mind. I mean, back in the day, getting a loan involved endless trips to SBI and filling out forms in triplicate. Now, there are apps that promise instant approval, and while I'm always a little skeptical, some of them seem legit. Has anyone actually used these? I'm seeing ads for KreditBee, Navi, and even some newer ones I've never heard of. Are the interest rates as low as they claim, or are there hidden fees lurking in the fine print?", "normalised": "Okay, so I've been diving deep into the world of F-I-N-T-E-C-H startups in India lately, and it's kind of blowing my mind.

{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm curious about the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) options. I saw a report that India's BNPL market is expected to hit $45-50 billion by FY2026. That’s a crazy number! It seems like every other e-commerce platform is pushing these. I’m thinking of using it for a new phone, maybe the Realme GT, which is around ₹30,000.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about UPI? It's insane how quickly it's taken over. I remember when everyone used cash, and now, even the chai wallah accepts payments through PhonePe. It’s so convenient, but I still get worried about security. Like, is it really safe to link my bank account to all these apps? My cousin got scammed for Rs. 2000 somehow, so I'm extra cautious.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole crypto thing. I know it’s not strictly \"Fintech,\" but there’s so much overlap. Everyone I know is talking about Bitcoin or Ethereum, but honestly, it feels like gambling to me. I'd rather put my money in a fixed deposit at HDFC Bank, even if the returns are only 6.5% pa.
