{"unnormalised": "From what I've gathered, UPI is pretty ubiquitous, right? Seems like everyone from chai wallahs to big retailers uses it. I saw a report saying UPI transactions crossed ₹10 Trillion in a single month. Is that accurate? And what about the risks?

How secure is the system really, and what measures are being taken to mitigate these risks?

But I'm also concerned about the high interest rates and aggressive recovery practices. I’ve heard horror stories about people getting trapped in debt cycles because of these apps. What's the RBI doing to regulate this sector and protect consumers?

I know there's a lot of buzz around AI and blockchain, but are these technologies actually being used in practical ways to improve financial services? I recently saw a company advertising AI-powered fraud detection which said it could prevent 99% of fraudulent UPI transactions. Is it really true? I understand many startup companies are developing new products with initial investment from prominent investor companies, valued at approximately USD 500 million, or about ₹4150 crore.
