{"unnormalised": "It all started when my cousin, Rohan (yeah, the one who's obsessed with crypto), convinced me to check out this new app called \"BharatPay.\" He kept saying it was the \"future of finance, bro!\" I was skeptical, tbh.

{"unnormalised": "Anyway, I downloaded the app and started exploring. The first thing that struck me was how many options there were! From instant loans (starting at APR 12.5%) to investment schemes promising crazy returns (like 18% annually!). It was a bit overwhelming, ngl.

{"unnormalised": "Then there were the UPI offers. Every time I made a transaction of ₹500 or more, I'd get a scratch card with a chance to win up to Rs. 100. It was kinda addictive, TBH!

{"unnormalised": "But here’s where things got interesting. Rohan told me about this thing called \"auto-sweep,\" which automatically moves any amount above Rs. 10,000 from your BharatPay wallet to a partner bank account to earn interest.

{"unnormalised": "So, yeah, Indian fintech is booming. Apps like BharatPay, PhonePe, Google Pay (they all are more or less the same, aren't they?), are making transactions easier than ever. But it's also a bit of a minefield. You gotta be careful, read the fine print, and don't fall for the hype. And always remember, Rohan is Rohan, he might not know everything. Anyone else here tried any of these Fintech apps, share your experince! I'm really interested in knowing if anyone has had a negative expereince, like a failed payment or a fraudelent transaction. Lets get a discussion going.", "normalised": "So, yeah, Indian fintech is booming.
