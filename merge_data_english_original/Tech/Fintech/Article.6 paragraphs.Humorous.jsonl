{"unnormalised": "India's fintech scene is hotter than a plate of mirchi bhajji on a summer afternoon. Every day, it seems, a new startup pops up, promising to revolutionize everything from lending to investing to, I don't know, maybe even paying for chai at your local tapri. But are they really disrupting the market, or are they just incredibly good at asking for money in a tech-savvy way?", "normalised": "India's fintech scene is hotter than a plate of mirchi bhajji on a summer afternoon.

We've got UPI, KYC, AI, ML, and a whole alphabet soup of other abbreviations that sound impressive but, let's be honest, half of us don't actually understand.

It's gotten to the point where even my grandma is using Paytm to send Rs. 10 to her favourite temple. She still insists on checking the balance with the shopkeeper to be sure though! Old habits die hard, even in the age of fintech.", "normalised": "One of the biggest trends is, of course, the rise of digital wallets.

I'm picturing a bunch of disgruntled lenders showing up at your door, demanding their money back with interest at 24% APR! It sounds less like a financial revolution and more like a Bollywood movie plot waiting to happen.", "normalised": "Then there is the whole peer-to-peer lending thing.

{"unnormalised": "But let's not be entirely cynical. Some of these fintech startups are actually doing some good. They're making financial services more accessible to people in rural areas, helping small businesses get loans, and generally shaking up the stuffy old banking system. Plus, the funding rounds are insane. XYZ Fintech just raised $15 million in Series A! That’s enough to buy a small island, provided you’re not looking at something in the Maldives.", "normalised": "But let's not be entirely cynical.

{"unnormalised": "So, are fintech startups disrupting the market or just asking for money really nicely? The answer, as always, is probably somewhere in between. They're a bit like that overly enthusiastic auto-rickshaw driver who promises to get you across town in 5 minutes but ends up taking you on a scenic tour of every pothole in the city. You might get there eventually, but it's going to be a bumpy ride. And you'll probably end up paying more than you expected.", "normalised": "So, are fintech startups disrupting the market or just asking for money really nicely?
