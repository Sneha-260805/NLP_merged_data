I’m talking about 90% of my transactions through apps like GPay or PhonePe. I see news articles every day about UPI transactions exceeding 10 billion monthly. Is that actually happening?", "normalised": "First off, U-P-I is king, right? Seriously, I haven't used cash in ages. My chaiwala even takes U-P-I payments now. It's crazy convenient.

I’ve seen news articles about these instant loan apps charging crazy high interest rates, like 36% or something ridiculous. Has anyone had any experiences, good or bad?

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about crypto? I know it's been a bit of a wild ride globally, but how's the sentiment in India? I remember seeing articles about the govt. considering a crypto ban, and then not, and then taxing it heavily. I have some friends who are knee-deep in it, using exchanges like WazirX, but I'm not sure if it's really worth the risk. Any thoughts on the future of crypto in India? Maybe I should start with a Rs. 100 investment?", "normalised": "Also, what about crypto? I know it's been a bit of a wild ride globally, but how's the sentiment in India?

{"unnormalised": "I'm also curious about the role of AI in fintech. I read somewhere that some companies are using AI to assess credit risk and offer personalized financial advice.
