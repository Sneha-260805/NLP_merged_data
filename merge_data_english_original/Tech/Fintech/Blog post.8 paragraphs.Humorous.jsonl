{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's be real. We Indians love our tech, especially when it comes to handling money. We've embraced Fintech like a long-lost chaiwala reunion – warm, enthusiastic, and slightly chaotic. I mean, who hasn't bragged about paying their local panipuri vendor via Paytm? It's practically a national sport now, alongside cricket and arguing about Bollywood remakes.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's be real.

{"unnormalised": "Take the dreaded UPI failure, for example. You're standing in line at D-Mart, desperately trying to buy that last packet of Maggi (because adulting is hard, okay?). You scan the QR code, enter your magical PIN, and then… the wheel of doom starts spinning. \"Transaction Failed. Please try again.\" Your palms get sweaty, your anxiety levels skyrocket, and the cashier starts giving you that \"really, bro?\" look. Cost of the Maggi: Rs. 45. Stress levels: Priceless.", "normalised": "Take the dreaded U-P-I failure, for example.

{"unnormalised": "Let's not forget the joys of navigating multiple Fintech apps. PhonePe, Google Pay, BharatPe…it's like a never-ending alphabet soup of payment options. You have to remember which app has your linked bank accounts, which one gives you the best cashback offers (Rs. 10 off on your next Swiggy order!), and which one your dear Uncle Sharma uses to send you \"shagun\" money on Diwali(₹501, bless his heart).

{"unnormalised": "But hey, despite all the glitches and occasional heart attacks, we still love our Fintech. It's convenient, it's (mostly) reliable, and it saves us from the horror of carrying around wads of cash. Just remember to keep a sense of humor about it all.
