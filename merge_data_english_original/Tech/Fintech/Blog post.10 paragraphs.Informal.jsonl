{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! So, let's talk fintech in India, huh? It's gone absolutely bonkers, hasn't it? Remember those days when transferring money meant a trip to the bank and filling out a form longer than my grocery list? Ugh. Now, thanks to UPI and a million other cool things, it’s all taps and swipes on our phones. My dadi can now even use Paytm, imagine that! She calls it magic!", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "Think about it – not too long ago, banking was all about these huge, intimidating institutions. Now, you've got startups like Zerodha and Groww letting anyone dabble in the stock market. Seriously, anyone! My cousin, who used to spend all his time playing PUBG, is now a certified investor!

{"unnormalised": "UPI, though, that's the real game-changer. I mean, paying the chai walla with my phone? Paying the auto-rickshaw driver? It’s almost frictionless!

{"unnormalised": "And it’s not just payments, right? There’s a whole wave of fintech companies offering loans, insurance, and all sorts of other financial services. These guys are targeting everyone, from the average joe to small businesses. It's making finance way more accessible than ever before. Just saw an ad on Insta claiming you can get personal loans starting at 9.99% interest. Sounds tempting, but I’ll stick to my boring bank for now.", "normalised": "And it's not just payments, right?
