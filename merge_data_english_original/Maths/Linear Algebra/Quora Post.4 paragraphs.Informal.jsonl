{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm a bit stuck on this Linear Algebra problem. It’s asking about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and frankly, it's gone completely over my head! Like, I understand the basic concepts, determinants and matrices and all that, but when they throw in stuff like finding the characteristic equation, I just freeze. Anyone got any tips? Especially if you can explain it like I'm 5, haha!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm a bit stuck on this Linear Algebra problem.
