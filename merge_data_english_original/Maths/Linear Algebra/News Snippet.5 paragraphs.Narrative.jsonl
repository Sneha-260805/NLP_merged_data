{"unnormalised": "The news from IIT Delhi today was buzzing with excitement. Apparently, a team of 3 undergrads cracked a particularly thorny problem in linear algebra – something to do with inverting a 500x500 matrix, I overheard someone saying near the canteen. Prof. Mishra’s class, specifically, was the source of the breakthrough. He'd apparently set the problem as an extra credit challenge at the end of the semester.", "normalised": "The news from I-I-T Delhi today was buzzing with excitement.
