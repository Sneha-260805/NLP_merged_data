Matrix operations! Your phone's camera figuring out where to focus? Linear Algebra, yaar!\" He then pointed to a slide filled with intimidating symbols, claiming it all boiled down to solving systems of equations. Apparently, even your GPS uses some fancy version of it.

It’s all built on the back of algorithms derived from Linear Algebra principles. Recommendation systems? Yup, you guessed it – Linear Algebra pulling the strings. Even understanding how search engines rank websites relies heavily on understanding eigenvector centrality – a concept that scares many undergraduates in their 1st year.", "normalised": "The good prof continued, explaining that Linear Algebra is the unsung hero behind a lot of tech.

{"unnormalised": "And it’s not just tech, the expert emphasized, according to Prof. Mehra. Financial modeling? Stock market predictions? Risk assessment? All these areas leverage the power of Linear Algebra to analyze data, identify trends, and make informed decisions. Even things like predicting weather patterns or optimizing supply chain logistics heavily rely on linear algebra to formulate mathematical models. He cited real-world examples like how logistics companies use it to optimize delivery routes, saving lakhs of rupees annually. One such success was reported by a company, LogiCorp, located at 14, MG Road, Bangalore.", "normalised": "And it’s not just tech, the expert emphasized, according to Professor Mehra.

{"unnormalised": "\"The key is to move beyond the textbook and see how these principles are applied in the real world,\" Dr. Mehra stated. According to his lecture, this involves things like understanding vectors in 3D space (essential for computer graphics and game development), understanding linear transformations (which can be used to manipulate images and videos), and working with complex matrices (used in fields such as quantum mechanics). He also urged students to explore software libraries like NumPy and SciPy, which provide tools for performing complex linear algebra operations in Python.", "normalised": "\"The key is to move beyond the textbook and see how these principles are applied in the real world,\" Doctor Mehra stated.

It might not be the most glamorous subject, but it's definitely one of the most powerful. And who knows, maybe understanding a few of those dusty textbook principles might just get you a job paying more than Rs. 20,00,000 per annum. Just putting it out there!", "normalised": "So, next time you're scrolling through Instagram or using Google Maps, remember that Linear Algebra is working hard behind the scenes.
