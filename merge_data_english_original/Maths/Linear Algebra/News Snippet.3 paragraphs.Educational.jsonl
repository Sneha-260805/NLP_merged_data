{"unnormalised": "The new method focuses on optimizing matrix inversion for matrices larger than 1000x1000. Existing techniques often struggle with such large datasets. Dr. Iyer explained that their approach leverages properties of sparse matrices to reduce the number of floating-point operations required. Initial tests showed a reduction of approximately 0.05 seconds per iteration on a standard benchmark problem.", "normalised": "The new method focuses on optimizing matrix inversion for matrices larger than one thousand by one thousand.
