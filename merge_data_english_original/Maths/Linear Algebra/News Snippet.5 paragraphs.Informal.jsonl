They claim their method cuts down computational complexity from O(n^3) to something closer to O(n^2.5). Big deal for anyone dealing with million-by-million matrices.

{"unnormalised": "Early benchmarks are promising. They compared their algo against industry standard solvers like LAPACK and showed significant speedups on matrices with dimensions ranging from 1000x1000 to 10000x10000. Apparently, the biggest gains were seen when dealing with sparse matrices, which are common in real-world applications. Tests showed a 3x to 5x performance jump on average, which is huge.", "normalised": "Early benchmarks are promising.
