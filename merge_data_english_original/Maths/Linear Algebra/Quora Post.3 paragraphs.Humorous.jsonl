You think balancing equations in chemistry was tough? Try solving a system of 100 equations with 100 unknowns without Linear Algebra! You'll be crying into your chai faster than you can say \"Eigenvalue.\" In fact, next time aunty asks, just say, \"Auntyji, I'm currently preoccupied with solving a complex eigenvalue problem in a 100-dimensional vector space!\" Watch her run!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked, \"Is Linear Algebra actually useful?\" Bhai, let me tell you, it is more useful than trying to explain to your relatives why you are still not married!

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, beyond dodging awkward family encounters, Linear Algebra is like the secret sauce of the digital world. Think about image compression – you know, making those HUGE vacation photos fit on your phone? That's Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) doing its magic! Then there's machine learning. Ever wondered how Netflix suggests shows you *actually* want to watch? It's all Linear Algebra baby! From recommendation systems to facial recognition, 90% of it uses concepts like matrices, vectors, and transformations.
