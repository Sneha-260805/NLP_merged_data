{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me how Linear Algebra is actually applied in real life. It is a great question. Linear Algebra finds applications in diverse fields like Computer Graphics, Data Science, Engineering, and Physics. In Computer Graphics, linear transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation, are represented using matrices. For instance, consider a 3x3 matrix representing a rotation by 45 degrees around the z-axis. These matrices operate on vectors representing points in 3D space to achieve the desired visual effects.", "normalised": "Someone asked me how Linear Algebra is actually applied in real life. It is a great question. Linear Algebra finds applications in diverse fields like Computer Graphics, Data Science, Engineering, and Physics.

{"unnormalised": "In Data Science, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) rely heavily on Linear Algebra. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, using concepts such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let us say you have a dataset with 100 features. PCA can help reduce it to, say, 10 features while retaining 95% of the variance. This simplifies modeling and improves performance.", "normalised": "In Data Science, techniques like P-C-A rely heavily on Linear Algebra. P-C-A is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, using concepts such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let us say you have a dataset with one hundred features. P-C-A can help reduce it to, say, ten features while retaining ninety five percent of the variance. This simplifies modeling and improves performance."}
{"unnormalised": "Engineering applications are equally significant. In structural analysis, engineers use finite element methods which involve solving systems of linear equations to determine stresses and strains in structures. Take for example a bridge. The stresses can be determined by modeling it using equations such as Ax = b. These equations are solved to optimize its design and ensure stability.", "normalised": "Engineering applications are equally significant.
