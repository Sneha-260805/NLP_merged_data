{"unnormalised": "Okay, so imagine you have a matrix, let's call it 'A'. Now, if you multiply 'A' with a vector, 'v', you get another vector. An eigenvector is a special vector 'v' that, when multiplied by 'A', only changes in scale, not direction. The amount by which it scales is called the eigenvalue, denoted as 'λ'. So, the equation is A * v = λ * v. Think of it like this: if 'A' represents a transformation, the eigenvector 'v' is a vector that remains aligned after the transformation, simply stretched or compressed by a factor of λ. Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors often involves solving polynomial equations; finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial det(A - λI) = 0 gives you the eigenvalues, where 'I' is the identity matrix. In 3x3 matrices, this requires a bit more work, especially when the eigenvalues are complex. You might need to remember your complex number manipulations from class 11 maths!", "normalised": "Okay, so imagine you have a matrix, let us call it 'A'.

{"unnormalised": "So, where are these used? One significant application is in Google's PageRank algorithm. The internet can be represented as a massive network, with web pages as nodes and links as edges. PageRank uses the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the link matrix to determine the relative importance of each page. Another application is in image compression techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA uses eigenvectors to identify the principal components of an image, allowing you to reduce the data size without losing too much information. Say you have an image of 1024x768 pixels, you can use PCA and keep only the top 100 eigenvectors representing most of the image information. In physics, they're used to find the normal modes of vibration of a system, be it molecules or bridges!", "normalised": "So, where are these used?

By identifying these \"invariant\" directions and scaling factors, we can understand how a linear transformation acts on a space and use this knowledge to solve problems in various fields.
