{"unnormalised": "IIT Delhi researchers have developed a new algorithm for solving linear equations faster! It seems complex, but at its core, it leverages something called 'sparse matrices'. Basically, instead of dealing with all those crazy numbers in a big grid, they focus on the important ones, the non-zero entries. They say this new method works especially well for problems involving massive datasets, like the ones used in AI and data science. Early tests show a speed boost of up to 30% compared to existing methods!", "normalised": "I-I-T Delhi researchers have developed a new algorithm for solving linear equations faster!

{"unnormalised": "So, what does this mean for the average person? Well, faster calculations can lead to quicker and more efficient AI models. Think about things like improved weather forecasting, better medical diagnoses, or even more accurate financial predictions. All these things rely on solving complex linear equations.", "normalised": "So, what does this mean for the average person?

{"unnormalised": "The algorithm uses a technique that reduces the number of computations needed. Imagine you're solving a system of 1000 equations with 1000 unknowns. A traditional method may involve millions of operations. This new method, by cleverly exploiting the sparsity of the matrix (let’s say 99% of the entries are 0), it cuts down the calculations dramatically, maybe by 1/3rd! The code for the prototype is written in Python & MATLAB, and the team is looking into porting it to C++ for further optimization.", "normalised": "The algorithm uses a technique that reduces the number of computations needed.
