Think of it like this: you're at a wedding in Delhi, trying to arrange 15 relatives (Uncle Sharma *insists* on being in the front), and you need to figure out the seating plan so nobody fights over the laddus. That's linear algebra, but tastier. It helps arrange vectors like wedding guests efficiently!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone's asking about Linear Algebra.

From Google's PageRank algorithm (which decides which website gets to bother you first), to image processing (making your Instagram selfies look *slightly* less awful), it's all Linear Algebra under the hood.

{"unnormalised": "So, is Linear Algebra hard? Well, let's just say it requires a different kind of brainpower – the kind that can juggle abstract ideas while simultaneously keeping track of whether you've carried the 1 correctly during matrix multiplication. The good news is, once you get the hang of it, you can impress your friends by casually mentioning eigenvalues at the next Diwali party! And, you know, maybe even help Uncle Sharma finally understand the seating arrangement. Just maybe. 😉", "normalised": "So, is Linear Algebra hard?
