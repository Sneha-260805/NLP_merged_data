{"unnormalised": "So, I was prepping for my IIT-JEE and our maths teacher, Mr. Sharma, threw this linear algebra problem at us. It involved solving a system of equations: 2x + 3y = 7 and 4x - y = 2. He said, \"Solve this using matrix methods, it's gonna be on the exam!\". I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get the inverse of that 2x2 matrix right! Turns out, I kept messing up the sign while calculating the determinant, getting -14 instead of 14. Wasted so much time just because of 1 silly mistake! Eventually, I got x = 13/14 and y = 20/7 . Ugh, linear algebra!", "normalised": "So, I was prepping for my I-I-T J-E-E and our maths teacher, Mister Sharma, threw this linear algebra problem at us.
