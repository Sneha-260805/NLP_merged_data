{"unnormalised": "The research, spearheaded by Prof. Gayatri Menon of the Department of Mathematics, addresses a critical bottleneck in numerous applications, ranging from fluid dynamics simulations to financial modeling. Traditional methods for solving systems with 10000+ variables often demand prohibitive computational resources and time, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. Prof. Menon's team has developed an iterative algorithm, dubbed the \"Adaptive Subspace Projection Method\" (ASPM), which demonstrably reduces computational complexity by an estimated 30% compared to existing techniques like the Gauss-Seidel method.", "normalised": "The research, spearheaded by Professor Gayatri Menon of the Department of Mathematics, addresses a critical bottleneck in numerous applications, ranging from fluid dynamics simulations to financial modeling.

{"unnormalised": "The published paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the ASPM, including proofs of convergence and detailed comparisons with established algorithms. Numerical experiments were conducted on a suite of benchmark problems, showcasing the superior efficiency and robustness of the new method. One particularly compelling example involved the solution of a system arising from a finite element discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations, where the ASPM achieved a solution accuracy of 10^-6 in approximately 150 iterations, whereas the traditional conjugate gradient method required over 200 iterations to reach the same level of precision.", "normalised": "The published paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the A-S-P-M, including proofs of convergence and detailed comparisons with established algorithms.
