{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, quick q about Linear Algebra. I'm prepping for an exam and stuck on something. How do I actually apply eigenvalues and eigenvectors in real-world stuff, beyond, like, matrix transformations? My textbook just has theoretical examples, but I wanna know where this stuff is useful, y'know? Thinkin' like, is it used in signal processing or maybe even AI stuff? Any simple explanations or examples would be super helpful!", "normalised": "Hey guys, quick question about Linear Algebra. I am prepping for an exam and stuck on something.

{"unnormalised": "So, I remember our professor, Dr. Verma, mentioning something about using them in pagerank algorithm, Google’s original one. I think it was based on eigenvectors of a huge matrix representing the link structure of the web. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue kinda gives you the importance score for each page. Pretty neat, right? Almost feels like magic, haha. Makes you wonder what other cool tricks are hiding in linear algebra.", "normalised": "So, I remember our professor, Doctor Verma, mentioning something about using them in page rank algorithm, Google’s original one.

{"unnormalised": "Another application I saw somewhere was related to stability analysis in engineering systems. Like, if you have a system described by differential equations, you can use eigenvalues of the system's matrix to determine if the system is stable or not. If all the eigenvalues have negative real parts, then the system is stable. If you want to model electrical circuits with capacitors (C= 10μF), inductors (L = 5mH), and resistors (R=10 Ohms), finding the eigenvalues helps you understand whether the circuit oscillates or decays.", "normalised": "Another application I saw somewhere was related to stability analysis in engineering systems.

{"unnormalised": "And yes, absolutely AI. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a massive role in dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Imagine you're working with a dataset with tons of features, like a dataset of images of faces. Each image has 1000 features (1000 pixels), you can use PCA to find the \"principal components,\" which are basically the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of your data. You can use those few components to represent your data and cut the dimensions in ½. Then it's easier to build models (e.g., in image recognition).", "normalised": "And yes, absolutely A-I. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a massive role in dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (P-C-A).

{"unnormalised": "Hope this helps a bit! Linear algebra can seem abstract sometimes, but there are tonnes of applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors out there, if you just look for them. And don't forget, practice is key! Good luck with your exam bro!", "normalised": "Hope this helps a bit!
