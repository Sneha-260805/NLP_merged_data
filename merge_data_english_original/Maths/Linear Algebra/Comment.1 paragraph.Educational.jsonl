{"unnormalised": "So, for solving systems of linear equations, remember that if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is 0, you either have infinite solutions or no solution. If determinant is non-zero, then you have a unique solution. Like, for example, if u have equations x + y = 5 & 2x + 2y = 10, determinant becomes 1*2 - 1*2 = 0 but there are infinite solutions. And also, always remember Cramer's Rule. It's super useful.", "normalised": "So, for solving systems of linear equations, remember that if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, you either have infinite solutions or no solution.
