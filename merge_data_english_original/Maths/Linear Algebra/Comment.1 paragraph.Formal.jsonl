Convergence criteria are crucial; the spectral radius of the iteration matrix (B) must be < 1. Also note that pivoting strategies, although primarily discussed in the context of numerical stability for direct methods such as LU decomposition, are also applicable as preconditioning techniques when solving A*x=b using iterative solvers, sometimes improving convergence rates significantly - reducing iterations from say, 1000 to 500.", "normalised": "Regarding the recent discussion on solving simultaneous equations: while Gaussian elimination is effective, for larger systems, iterative methods like Gauss-Seidel are often preferred due to reduced computational complexity, especially when dealing with sparse matrices commonly found in fields like network analysis or F-E-A.
