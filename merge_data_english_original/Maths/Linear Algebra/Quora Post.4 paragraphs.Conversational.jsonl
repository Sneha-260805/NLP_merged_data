{"unnormalised": "Well, think about image processing, right? Every digital image is basically a matrix of pixel values. Operations like blurring, sharpening, or edge detection? They're all matrix transformations. In fact, your smartphone camera probably uses a bunch of Linear Algebra under the hood! Even something as simple as rotating an image on your phone relies on 2x2 transformation matrices. That filter you love on Insta?
