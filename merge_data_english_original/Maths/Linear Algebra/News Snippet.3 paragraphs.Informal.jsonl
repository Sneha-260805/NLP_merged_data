{"unnormalised": "IIT Delhi researchers have cracked a new algorithm for solving complex linear algebra equations! Sources say the team, led by Dr. Rajesh Kumar, has managed to reduce computation time by nearly 20% - that's HUGE, especially for fields like AI and data analysis. Apparently, their method involves clever manipulation of matrices with dimensions up to 1000x1000, allowing for faster and more efficient solutions.", "normalised": "I-I-T Delhi researchers have cracked a new algorithm for solving complex linear algebra equations!

{"unnormalised": "\"We were facing bottlenecks in our machine learning models due to the sheer size of the linear systems we had to solve,\" explained Kumar in an interview. \"This new algorithm could really prepone our project timelines.\" Their paper, titled \"Optimized Linear Solvers,\" has already garnered attention, with preprint servers reporting 500+ downloads in just 2 weeks. Experts are saying this could be a game-changer in various applications.", "normalised": "\"We were facing bottlenecks in our machine learning models due to the sheer size of the linear systems we had to solve,\" explained Kumar in an interview. \"This new algorithm could really prepone our project timelines.\" Their paper, titled \"Optimized Linear Solvers,\" has already garnered attention, with preprint servers reporting five hundred plus downloads in just two weeks.

It's expected to be implemented in open-source libraries within the next 6 months. Congrats to the IIT Delhi team on this breakthrough! Hopefully, it helps us solve our own \"linear\" problems in life!
