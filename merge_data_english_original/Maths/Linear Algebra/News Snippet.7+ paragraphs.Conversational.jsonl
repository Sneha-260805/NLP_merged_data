{"unnormalised": "Apparently, the key innovation lies in a novel approach to matrix decomposition. Existing methods like LU decomposition or QR decomposition often hit bottlenecks when dealing with extremely large matrices, a common occurrence in big data applications. FastSolvLA employs something they're calling \"Adaptive Subspace Partitioning\" or ASP, which dynamically adjusts the size of sub-matrices during computation. Think of it like this: instead of trying to solve the whole problem at once, it cleverly breaks it down into bite-sized chunks, optimizing for the underlying structure of the data. Initial tests run on a supercomputer at IISc Bangalore showed performance gains across a range of benchmark datasets.", "normalised": "Apparently, the key innovation lies in a novel approach to matrix decomposition.
