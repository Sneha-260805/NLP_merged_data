It depicted a matrix with seemingly random numbers, including fractions to the power of 2, along with the instruction: ‘Determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors using appropriate row and column reduction methods’. Even amongst math circles outside of IIT Delhi, the question was said to be exceptionally challenging. A post graduate student from the University of Madras described it as 'something you'd expect to see on a PhD entrance exam'.", "normalised": "Later in the day, a picture of the original question (reportedly leaked from a student's discarded paper) went viral.
