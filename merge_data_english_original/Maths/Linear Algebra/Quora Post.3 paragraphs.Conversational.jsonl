{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked me about how important Linear Algebra is, especially if you're looking at fields like Data Science. Well, trust me, it's pretty crucial! You might think Calc 1, 2, and 3 are the holy grails of math, and they're important too, no doubt. But for understanding the math underpinning machine learning? Linear Algebra is your friend. It's like, 80% of the math you'll actually use on a daily basis. Don't skip this important base.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked me about how important Linear Algebra is, especially if you are looking at fields like Data Science.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it: data is often organized into matrices. Images are represented as matrices of pixel values (e.g., a 256x256 image). Datasets for machine learning are often represented as matrices, with rows representing samples and columns representing features. Linear algebra provides the tools to manipulate and analyze these matrices. Operations like matrix multiplication, solving systems of linear equations (like Ax = b), and eigenvalue decomposition are all fundamental to machine learning algorithms. Even something simple like a rotation uses matrices! You might encounter terms like SVD and PCA. SVD, for instance, is used in image compression and recommender systems. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used for dimensionality reduction, bringing down 1000 dimensions to 10, for example.", "normalised": "Think about it: data is often organized into matrices.

{"unnormalised": "So yeah, Linear Algebra is not just some abstract math course. It gives you the skills to actually _understand_ how machine learning models work. Forget just memorizing equations, you can build things with Linear Algebra. If you're serious about AI/ML, invest the time in learning it properly. You won't regret it! Seriously, go back to your notes from class or maybe just review from resources such as MIT 18.06 lectures. You need to understand the underlying concepts and be able to apply them practically.", "normalised": "So yeah, Linear Algebra is not just some abstract math course.
