{"unnormalised": "Someone just asked me about linear algebra, and honestly, my head started spinning a bit! I remember struggling through it back in my B.Tech days at IIT Delhi. Prof. Sharma was brilliant, no doubt, but sometimes the concepts felt like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. We spent hours on topics like eigenvalues and eigenvectors, trying to figure out how to apply them. I think I finally got a grasp on matrix operations, solving systems of equations with 3 or 4 variables, though Cramer's rule felt like cheating, didn't it?", "normalised": "someone just asked me about linear algebra, and honestly, my head started spinning a bit!

Especially chapter 6, questions 12-20. I also remember spending ages trying to understand Gaussian elimination - seems simple now, but back then it was a nightmare. We even had one exam question that involved a 5x5 matrix – absolute torture.", "normalised": "one thing that really helped was visualizing the transformations.

{"unnormalised": "Looking back, I realise how important linear algebra is, even though I'm not using it directly in my current job. From image processing to data analysis, it's everywhere! Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I need a strong cup of chai before I start trying to remember the formula for calculating a determinant… maybe YouTube can help. I'll search for \"Linear Algebra explained simply\" and see what pops up.", "normalised": "looking back, I realise how important linear algebra is, even though I'm not using it directly in my current job.
