Reportedly, only 65% of candidates could correctly solve a basic matrix inversion problem, a core concept.

{"unnormalised": "The new method, inspired by research from ISI Kolkata, involved presenting the problems in a narrative format. Candidates had to translate a real-world scenario – say, calculating resource allocation given constraints - into a system of linear equations and then solve it. A mere 40% of students passed this section, highlighting a gap between theoretical knowledge & practical application. Many students scored well in the theory section with scores over 90/100 but struggled to apply the concepts.", "normalised": "The new method, inspired by research from I-S-I Kolkata, involved presenting the problems in a narrative format.
