{"unnormalised": "What really helped me, though, was focusing on the practical applications. Instead of just memorizing formulas, I started trying to understand *why* these concepts mattered. For example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) uses eigenvectors to reduce the dimensionality of data. Think about it: image compression! That's linear algebra in action. I spent hours on sites like Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare, watching videos that broke down the complex math into bite-sized pieces. I even found a cool visualizer that showed how matrix multiplication transforms vectors in real-time - really helped my intuition.", "normalised": "What really helped me, though, was focusing on the practical applications.
