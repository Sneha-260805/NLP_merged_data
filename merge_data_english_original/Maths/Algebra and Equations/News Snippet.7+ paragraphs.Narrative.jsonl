{"unnormalised": "In a quiet corner of Allahabad, a young math prodigy has sent ripples of astonishment through the international mathematics community. 17-year-old Rohan Mehra, a student at Saraswati Vidya Mandir, claims to have solved a hitherto unsolvable algebraic equation, one that has baffled mathematicians for over 7 decades. The equation, often referred to as the \"Mehra Equation\" by his peers, involved complex polynomials and multiple variables, a Gordian knot of numbers and symbols.", "normalised": "In a quiet corner of Allahabad, a young math prodigy has sent ripples of astonishment through the international mathematics community. seventeen-year-old Rohan Mehra, a student at Saraswati Vidya Mandir, claims to have solved a hitherto unsolvable algebraic equation, one that has baffled mathematicians for over seven decades.

{"unnormalised": "The story began as a school project when Rohan was assigned to write a research paper for a regional math competition. Inspired by the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, the legendary Indian mathematician, Rohan delved into the depths of algebra, spending countless hours hunched over textbooks and scribbling furiously in his notebook. He recalls struggling with the problem for months, experiencing frustrating setbacks, only to rise up to the challenge. He claims to have devoted 14 hours/day, every day for the last six months on solving the problem.", "normalised": "The story began as a school project when Rohan was assigned to write a research paper for a regional math competition.

{"unnormalised": "\"At first, it seemed impossible,\" Rohan admitted during an interview in the humble Mehra family home. \"The equation appeared to resist all the standard methods. But I kept pushing, experimenting with different approaches, drawing inspiration from number theory and calculus.\" His 'eureka' moment arrived on a sweltering afternoon, fueled by endless cups of chai and an unshakeable determination. \"I saw a pattern, a hidden symmetry in the way the variables interacted. Suddenly, the entire structure collapsed like a house of cards, revealing a surprisingly elegant solution.\"", "normalised": "\"At first, it seemed impossible,\" Rohan admitted during an interview in the humble Mehra family home. \"The equation appeared to resist all the standard methods.

{"unnormalised": "The implications of Rohan's solution are far-reaching. The \"Mehra Equation\" has applications in various fields, including cryptography, theoretical physics, and computer science. His solution has been published in 'The Mathematical Gazette' (Vol. 107, No. 569, pp. 267-278), the prestigious math journal. In cryptography, it can provide a new, secure encryption algorithm. In theoretical physics, it can assist in understanding the fundamental structure of the universe.
