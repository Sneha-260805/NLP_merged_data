Instead of just saying \"5 + 3 = 8\", we might say \"x + 3 = 8\". Our job then becomes finding out what 'x' is. It’s like a puzzle! Imagine you have 'x' number of ladoos and your friend gives you 3 more, now you have 8 ladoos. How many did you start with?", "normalised": "So, what exactly is algebra?

{"unnormalised": "Now, onto equations! An equation is just a statement that two things are equal. The equals sign (=) is the key here. It's like a balancing scale – whatever's on one side *must* be equal to what's on the other. A simple example is \"2x + 5 = 11\". The goal is to isolate the variable ('x' in this case) to find its value. Remember, you can do anything to one side of the equation as long as you do the exact same thing to the other side to keep the balance.", "normalised": "Now, onto equations!

{"unnormalised": "Let's tackle that \"2x + 5 = 11\" equation. First, we need to get rid of the \"+ 5\" on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from *both* sides: 2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5. This simplifies to 2x = 6. See how we keep the equation balanced? Now, we have \"2x = 6\". That means 2 times 'x' is equal to 6. To find 'x', we divide both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 6 / 2. This gives us x = 3. Voila! We've solved the equation.", "normalised": "Let's tackle that \"two x plus five equals eleven\" equation. First, we need to get rid of the \"plus five\" on the left side. We do this by subtracting five from both sides: two x plus five minus five equals eleven minus five. This simplifies to two x equals six. See how we keep the equation balanced? Now, we have \"two x equals six\". That means two times 'x' is equal to six. To find 'x', we divide both sides by two: two x divided by two equals six divided by two. This gives us x equals three. Voila! We've solved the equation."}
{"unnormalised": "Another key concept is understanding different types of equations. We have linear equations (like the one we just solved, where the highest power of the variable is 1), quadratic equations (where the highest power is 2, like \"x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0\"), and even more complex types. Solving quadratic equations often involves factoring or using the quadratic formula which is: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). The ‘sqrt’ part means square root. So, for example, if you have x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, a=1, b=5 and c=6.", "normalised": "Another key concept is understanding different types of equations.

How many notebooks can you buy? If ‘y’ is the number of notebooks you can buy, then 25y = 150. Divide both sides by 25, and you get y = 6 notebooks.", "normalised": "Now, let's quickly look at applying these concepts to real-world problems. Suppose you are buying notebooks.
