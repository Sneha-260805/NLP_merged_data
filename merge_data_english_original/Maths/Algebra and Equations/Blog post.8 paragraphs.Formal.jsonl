{"unnormalised": "One of the fundamental concepts in algebra is the equation itself. An equation represents a statement of equality between two expressions. These expressions can involve variables, constants, and mathematical operations. For instance, the equation \"3x + 5 = 14\" illustrates a simple linear equation. The objective in solving such an equation is to find the value of the variable 'x' that makes the equation true. The methods for solving differ depending on the equation's complexity.", "normalised": "One of the fundamental concepts in algebra is the equation itself.

{"unnormalised": "Linear equations are the simplest form of algebraic equations. They involve variables raised to the power of 1, and their graphs are straight lines. Solving linear equations typically involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation using algebraic manipulations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Consider the equation 2y - 7 = 3. Adding 7 to both sides gives 2y = 10, and dividing both sides by 2 yields y = 5.", "normalised": "Linear equations are the simplest form of algebraic equations.

{"unnormalised": "Quadratic equations, on the other hand, are polynomial equations of degree 2. They can be written in the general form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants and 'a' is not equal to 0. Solving quadratic equations can be achieved through various methods, including factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is particularly useful when factoring is difficult or impossible. The formula states that for an equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions for x are given by x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. Consider the equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = (5 ± √(25 - 4*1*6)) / 2*1. This simplifies to x = (5 ± √1) / 2, giving the solutions x = 3 and x = 2.", "normalised": "Quadratic equations, on the other hand, are polynomial equations of degree two.

Using the quadratic formula, x equals the quantity five plus or minus the square root of the quantity twenty five minus four multiplied by one multiplied by six, all divided by two multiplied by one. This simplifies to x equals the quantity five plus or minus the square root of one, all divided by two, giving the solutions x equals three and x equals two."}
{"unnormalised": "Systems of equations involve two or more equations with multiple variables. The goal is to find values for the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously. Common methods for solving systems of equations include substitution, elimination, and matrix methods. Consider the system: x + y = 7 and x - y = 1. Adding the two equations eliminates 'y', resulting in 2x = 8, which gives x = 4. Substituting x = 4 into the first equation yields 4 + y = 7, so y = 3.", "normalised": "Systems of equations involve two or more equations with multiple variables.
