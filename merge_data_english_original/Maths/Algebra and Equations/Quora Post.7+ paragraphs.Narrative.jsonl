{"unnormalised": "One day, I was at the canteen, downing a much-needed chai after failing a quiz, and overheard a conversation between two seniors. They were discussing Cramer's Rule and using matrices. I knew matrices existed (linear algebra was next sem), but only vaguely. One of them mentioned that solving equation set like `ax + by = c`, `dx + ey = f` can be solved using matrix math easily. They wrote something down on a napkin - looked like `([[a,b],[d,e]]` and `[x,y]` but I couldn't make heads or tails of it fully.

{"unnormalised": "He even drew an analogy to balancing scales. Each equation, he said, was a balanced scale. You could perform the same operation on both sides (add, subtract, multiply, divide) without disturbing the balance, eventually isolating the variable you were interested in. Suddenly, things started clicking. It wasn't about memorizing a formula; it was about manipulating the equations legally to reveal the solution. The Determinant `D = ad - bc` he said, is what helps with the scaling. This helped relate the formulas back to real manipulation.", "normalised": "he even drew an analogy to balancing scales each equation he said was a balanced scale you could perform the same operation on both sides add subtract multiply divide without disturbing the balance eventually isolating the variable you were interested in suddenly things started clicking it wasn't about memorizing a formula it was about manipulating the equations legally to reveal the solution the determinant D equals a d minus b c he said is what helps with the scaling this helped relate the formulas back to real manipulation"}

{"unnormalised": "That chai-fueled algebra lesson changed everything. I finally understood what was going on and started acing the quizzes. I even started helping other students who were struggling, passing on Rohan's explanation. So yeah, that's my algebra story. If you are struggling with systems of equations, don't just memorize formulas. Find someone who can explain the underlying logic. Go and ask your prof or the class toppers or any of the TAs! It makes all the difference in the world. And maybe share a chai with them, while at it.", "normalised": "that chai fueled algebra lesson changed everything I finally understood what was going on and started acing the quizzes I even started helping other students who were struggling passing on Rohan's explanation so yeah that's my algebra story if you are struggling with systems of equations don't just memorize formulas find someone who can explain the underlying logic go and ask your professor or the class toppers or any of the T-A-s it makes all the difference in the world and maybe share a chai with them while at it"}
