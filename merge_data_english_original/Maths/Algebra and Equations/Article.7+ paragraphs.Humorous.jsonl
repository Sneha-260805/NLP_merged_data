{"unnormalised": "Algebra. The very word can send shivers down the spines of perfectly rational adults. Visions of 'x' and 'y' dance menacingly in their heads, accompanied by the terrifying echo of forgotten quadratic formulas. But hold on a minute! Before you run screaming back to the comforting embrace of basic arithmetic, let's talk about why algebra is actually the unsung hero of everyday life, a secret weapon in the battle against, well, everything – including a hypothetical zombie apocalypse.", "normalised": "Algebra.

{"unnormalised": "Think of algebraic equations as elaborate puzzles. You're given some clues, some missing pieces, and you have to use your brainpower (yes, the very brainpower you thought you'd never need after school) to figure out the solution. Take a simple equation like 2x + 5 = 15. Suddenly, ‘x’ isn't just some random letter; it's the number of samosas Rakesh needs to buy for his family if he already has 5 rupees and needs a total of 15. See? Relatable!", "normalised": "Think of algebraic equations as elaborate puzzles.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's ramp up the absurdity a bit. Imagine that aforementioned zombie apocalypse has arrived. Priya is trying to calculate how many days her supplies of Maggi will last her, before she has to risk a trip to the local kirana store which she heard on a walkie talkie had about 10 zombies guarding its doors. She knows she eats 3 packets a day and has 21 packets in total, and she wants to know how many days this stockpile will last. Simple algebra! 3 * d = 21, solve for d, and Priya knows she has 7 days before she has to face those undead grocery shoppers.

{"unnormalised": "But algebra isn't just about solving for ‘x’ in isolation. It's about understanding relationships. Like, if the price of petrol goes up by ₹5 per liter, how much more will it cost you to drive from Delhi to Agra and back? (Assume a distance of 200 km each way and your car gives a mileage of 15 kmpl). Or, if you're baking gulab jamuns for Diwali and need to triple the recipe, how much of each ingredient do you need? These are real-world problems, people! (Okay, maybe the zombie apocalypse isn't a *real* world problem... yet.)", "normalised": "But algebra isn't just about solving for ‘x’ in isolation.

You see two offers: a flat 10% discount and a ₹3000 cashback. Which one saves you more money? Time to break out the algebra! (10/100) * 40000 = 4000. 4000 > 3000. The discount is better. Boom!

{"unnormalised": "So, next time you're confronted with an algebraic equation, don't panic. Think of it as a mental workout, a chance to flex your problem-solving muscles, and maybe, just maybe, a practice run for surviving the zombie apocalypse. After all, knowing how to calculate the trajectory of a strategically thrown coconut at an approaching horde might just save your life. Or at the very least, it'll help you figure out how to split the bill at your next chai break without any awkwardness. Remember, algebra isn't the enemy; it's your slightly quirky, overly complicated, but ultimately helpful friend.", "normalised": "So, next time you're confronted with an algebraic equation, don't panic.
