{"unnormalised": "The convention concluded with a compromise: a call for integrating practical applications into algebra curricula across all levels. This included introducing real-world problems involving algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities. The aim is to make mathematics more engaging and relevant for students, preparing them for both traditional fields and the rapidly evolving tech landscape. Specific topics mentioned in the proposed revised syllabus included solving simultaneous equations (e.g., 2x+3y=7 and 4x-y=9), manipulating polynomials (e.g., (x+2)(x-3)), and applying the quadratic formula (x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a).", "normalised": "The convention concluded with a compromise: a call for integrating practical applications into algebra curricula across all levels.
