{"unnormalised": "Alright folks, let's be honest. When you first hear the word \"algebra,\" does your heart leap with joy? Does a vision of solving complex equations dance in your head? Probably not. Most people, myself included, picture dusty textbooks and mind-numbing problem sets. But trust me, algebra isn't just some academic torture device designed to make your weekends miserable. It's actually kinda...useful? Maybe even, dare I say, fun? Well, relatively speaking. It's definitely better than waiting in line for the auto-rickshaw stand at 5 PM after a long day.", "normalised": "Alright folks, let's be honest.

{"unnormalised": "Think of algebra as a detective game. You're given a bunch of clues (the equation) and your job is to find the missing piece (the variable, usually represented by an 'x', because why not?). For example, take the equation 2x + 5 = 15. It's like saying, \"I doubled a number, added 5, and got 15. What was the original number?\". And trust me, you will need this eventually when splitting the bill among friends for a dinner.

The history of 'x' as a variable is actually pretty fascinating, involving Arabic translations and a whole lot of scholarly scribbling. But honestly, the real reason is probably that 'x' is just easy to write. Plus, imagine the chaos if we used different variables every time. Solving for 'chai' would be far more distracting, especially if it's the 4:00 PM kind.", "normalised": "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But why 'x'?

{"unnormalised": "Let's talk about some practical applications, shall we? Sure, you might not be solving quadratic equations on your way to buy sabzi, but algebra is the foundation for a ton of things you use every day. From calculating the EMI for your new phone to understanding how much data you're using on your Jio plan (probably way too much!), algebra is working behind the scenes. In fact, even your favorite Bollywood movies use complex algorithms based on algebraic principles to predict box office success. I swear! Okay, maybe not.", "normalised": "Let's talk about some practical applications, shall we?

Solving a tough algebraic problem is way more satisfying than finishing that last piece of gulab jamun (almost).
