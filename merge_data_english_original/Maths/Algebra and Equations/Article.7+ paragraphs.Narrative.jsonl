{"unnormalised": "My earliest encounters with algebra were, to put it mildly, disastrous. Solving simple equations like \"x + 5 = 10\" felt like trying to decipher an ancient script. I'd spend hours, pencil marks smudging across the page, struggling to isolate 'x'. Amma, bless her heart, tried her best to explain, using examples of buying mangoes at the local market. “If you have x mangoes, and I give you 5 more, and now you have 10 total, how many did you start with?\" She'd ask, her brow furrowed in concentration. Even with the mangoes, I’d invariably get the answer wrong. My first test score, a dismal 35%, is etched in my memory.", "normalised": "My earliest encounters with algebra were, to put it mildly, disastrous.

{"unnormalised": "The breakthrough came unexpectedly. Uncle Rajesh, a software engineer who visited us every Diwali, noticed my struggles. Instead of lecturing me, he approached it like a puzzle. \"Think of the '=' sign as a balance,\" he said, sketching a simple scale on a piece of paper. \"Whatever you do on one side, you must do on the other to keep it balanced.\" He started with easy examples, then slowly introduced more complex problems. He showed me how to rearrange terms, simplify expressions, and substitute values. One example that stuck was simplifying something like 3(x+2) - 2x = 10. He would patiently take me through each step.", "normalised": "The breakthrough came unexpectedly. Uncle Rajesh, a software engineer who visited us every Diwali, noticed my struggles.

{"unnormalised": "Suddenly, the algebraic rules started to click. The 'x' and 'y' ceased to be intimidating symbols and became placeholders, waiting to be revealed. I began to see the logic, the underlying structure, the beautiful symmetry of the equations. The notebook, once a source of frustration, became my trusted companion. I filled its pages with solved problems, each one a small victory. I practiced questions with variables like x, y, and even z. I learned to work with expressions like a^2 + b^2 = c^2, trying to find values that would satisfy the equality.", "normalised": "Suddenly, the algebraic rules started to click.

{"unnormalised": "Looking at the old notebook now, I am reminded not just of the equations I learned, but of the perseverance, the patient guidance, and the joy of discovery. It’s a reminder that even the most daunting challenges can be overcome with the right approach and a little bit of help from those who care. And, perhaps more importantly, that sometimes, the most unexpected journeys can lead to the most rewarding destinations. Even a small understanding of polynomial division gave me a new perspective, a way to think logically about numbers. Now, in my own career in finance, I use these basic principles almost daily, whether it is in projecting trends or calculating risk.
