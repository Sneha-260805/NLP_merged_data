{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I was just helping my little sister with her Class 8 maths homework, and I realised algebra can be super confusing if you don't get the basics right. She was struggling with solving simple linear equations, like 2x + 5 = 15, and honestly, it took me a minute to remember the steps properly! Anyone else find this a bit tough back in the day?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I was just helping my little sister with her Class eight maths homework, and I realised algebra can be super confusing if you don't get the basics right.

{"unnormalised": "The key thing is to remember to isolate the variable. So, first, you subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, which gives you 2x = 10. Then, you divide both sides by 2 to get x = 5. Simple enough, right? But for some reason, seeing it as \"2 into x plus 5 equals 15\" throws a lot of kids off. Maybe it's the way we teach it?", "normalised": "The key thing is to remember to isolate the variable. So, first, you subtract five from both sides of the equation, which gives you two x equals ten.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing I see a lot of students struggling with is word problems that involve setting up equations. For instance, \"If I have ₹100 and I spend x rupees, how much money do I have left?\" That translates to 100 - x = amount left. It sounds simple, but turning the words into algebraic expressions is a big hurdle for many. Remember those problems about trains leaving stations at different times? Total nightmare fuel!", "normalised": "Another thing I see a lot of students struggling with is word problems that involve setting up equations.

{"unnormalised": "My advice? Practice, practice, practice! And don't be afraid to ask for help from your teachers or online resources. There are tons of great videos and tutorials that can explain things in a way that clicks with you. Also, try to relate the equations to real-life scenarios. Like, if you're buying something that costs ₹75 and you have ₹200, how much change should you expect? (200 - 75 = ₹125).", "normalised": "My advice? Practice, practice, practice!

{"unnormalised": "Anyway, just thought I'd share some thoughts on this. Algebra can seem daunting at first, but with a little patience and practice, you'll get the hang of it. Good luck with your equations everyone! And tell me, what was the toughest algebra problem you ever faced? Maybe it involved finding the value of 'y' in a quadratic equation like y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0! 😉", "normalised": "Anyway, just thought I'd share some thoughts on this.
