If you’re anything like me, seeing something like `x + 5 = 10` sends shivers down your spine. Not good shivers, mind you. More like the shivers you get when you realize you forgot to pay your electricity bill and it's already the 25th of the month.", "normalised": "Alright folks, let’s talk about algebra.
