{"unnormalised": "Basically, it's something like: 3(x+2) - 5 = 7x - 4. I've tried expanding the brackets and stuff, but I'm just getting confused with the signs. I keep getting x = some weird fraction, like -1/2 or something. My friend Aisha got x = 3 but I don’t think that's right either. I think she might have missed a step.", "normalised": "Basically, it's something like: three multiplied by the quantity x plus two, minus five, equals seven x minus four.
