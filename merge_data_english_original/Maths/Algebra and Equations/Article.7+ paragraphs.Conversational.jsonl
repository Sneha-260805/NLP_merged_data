{"unnormalised": "At its heart, algebra is just using letters to represent unknown numbers. Imagine you’re buying samosas for ₹10 each, and you don’t know how many you're going to get. You could use 's' to represent the number of samosas. The total cost would then be 10s. See? You've already done some algebra!", "normalised": "At its heart, algebra is just using letters to represent unknown numbers. Imagine you’re buying samosas for rupee ten each, and you don’t know how many you're going to get. You could use 's' to represent the number of samosas. The total cost would then be ten s. See? You've already done some algebra!"}
{"unnormalised": "One of the most fundamental concepts in algebra is equations. An equation is simply a statement that two things are equal. For instance, if 2s = 20, that means 2 times the number of samosas (s) equals ₹20. Now, to solve for 's' (how many samosas you can buy), you need to isolate 's' on one side of the equation. This is like figuring out how many laddus each guest gets if you have 50 laddus and 10 guests.", "normalised": "One of the most fundamental concepts in algebra is equations.

{"unnormalised": "To do this, you perform the same operation on both sides of the equation. In the case of 2s = 20, you would divide both sides by 2. So, (2s)/2 = 20/2, which simplifies to s = 10. Boom! You can buy 10 samosas. This is what we call solving the equation. It is finding out the value of that unknown.", "normalised": "To do this, you perform the same operation on both sides of the equation.

{"unnormalised": "Now, things can get a bit more complicated, but the basic principle remains the same. You might encounter equations with multiple variables, like x + y = 15. This could represent the number of gulab jamuns and barfis you have, adding up to 15 in total. To solve these types of equations, you usually need more information, another equation relating x and y, for example. This second equation would help find the unique solution.", "normalised": "Now, things can get a bit more complicated, but the basic principle remains the same.

{"unnormalised": "Algebra has many uses beyond just calculating samosas and ladoos. It’s used in everything from designing bridges (think Bandra-Worli Sea Link) to predicting weather patterns. Engineers, scientists, economists, and even software developers use algebra every day.

{"unnormalised": "Don't be intimidated by the letters and symbols. Remember, algebra is a powerful tool that can help you solve problems and understand the world around you better. Just like perfecting your grandma’s secret biryani recipe, with practice, algebra will become second nature. Start with simple equations and gradually increase the difficulty. And remember, there are plenty of resources available online and in libraries if you need help. Maybe even ask your friendly neighbourhood Maths tutor or call up your classmate! Who knows, you may come to think of those x's and y's as your friends.", "normalised": "Don't be intimidated by the letters and symbols.
