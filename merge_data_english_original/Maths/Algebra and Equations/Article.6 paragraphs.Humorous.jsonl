Think of it as a puzzle, a game of hide-and-seek with 'x' and 'y'. Instead of finding a lost sock, you're finding the hidden value of a variable. Much more glamorous, isn't it?

{"unnormalised": "Now, equations. These are the VIPs of the algebraic world. Linear equations, quadratic equations, simultaneous equations – it's like a Bollywood cast reunion, but with numbers and symbols instead of fading actors. They’re always equal on both sides, like the perfect cup of chai – not too sweet, not too milky, just right. Just remember: keep things balanced. If you add 5 to one side of the equation, make sure you add 5 to the other side too. Unless you want your math to turn into a villainous plot twist.", "normalised": "Now, equations.

{"unnormalised": "And what's algebra without a few word problems thrown in to test your patience? \"If Raju has x mangoes and gives 2 to his friend Seema, how many mangoes does Raju have left?\" The key is to convert these everyday situations into algebraic expressions. Think of \"x\" as the mystery number of mangoes Raju started with. If he started with 10 mangoes (x = 10), then he has 10-2 = 8 left. So now he can enjoy 8 mangoes while Seema gets 2, total of 10 (100% of mangoes!)", "normalised": "And what's algebra without a few word problems thrown in to test your patience? \"If Raju has x mangoes and gives two to his friend Seema, how many mangoes does Raju have left?\" The key is to convert these everyday situations into algebraic expressions.
