{"unnormalised": "I'm prepping for my Class 10 boards and algebra is giving me a tough time! Any tips on solving quadratic equations quickly?", "normalised": "Solving quadratic equations can seem daunting at first, but with a few tricks and practice, you can definitely master them. Remember that a standard quadratic equation is represented as a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants. The most common method is factoring, but this only works if the equation can be easily broken down into two binomials. For example, if you have x squared plus five x plus six equals zero, you can factor it into open parenthesis x plus two close parenthesis open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis equals zero, giving you solutions x equals minus two and x equals minus three."}
{"unnormalised": "Solving quadratic equations can seem daunting at first, but with a few tricks and practice, you can definitely master them. Remember that a standard quadratic equation is represented as ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants. The most common method is factoring, but this only works if the equation can be easily broken down into two binomials. For example, if you have x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, you can factor it into (x+2)(x+3) = 0, giving you solutions x = -2 and x = -3.", "normalised": "When factoring doesn't work, use the quadratic formula: x equals open bracket minus b plus or minus square root of open parenthesis b squared minus four a c close parenthesis close bracket divided by two a. Let’s say you’ve got the equation two x squared plus seven x plus three equals zero. Here, a equals two, b equals seven, and c equals three. Plug these values into the formula, and you'll get x equals open bracket minus seven plus or minus square root of open parenthesis forty nine minus twenty four close parenthesis close bracket divided by four. Simplify that, and you get x equals open bracket minus seven plus or minus square root of twenty five close bracket divided by four. So x equals open bracket minus seven plus or minus five close bracket divided by four. This gives you two solutions: x equals minus zero point five and x equals minus three."}
{"unnormalised": "When factoring doesn't work, use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. Let’s say you’ve got the equation 2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 0. Here, a = 2, b = 7, and c = 3. Plug these values into the formula, and you'll get x = [-7 ± √(49 - 24)] / 4. Simplify that, and you get x = [-7 ± √25] / 4. So x = [-7 ± 5] / 4. This gives you two solutions: x = -0.5 and x = -3.", "normalised": "Another helpful technique is completing the square, which is useful when the 'a' coefficient isn't one. This involves manipulating the equation to create a perfect square trinomial. While it might seem complex, with practice, it becomes quite efficient. Remember to always double-check your solutions by plugging them back into the original equation. For instance, if one solution is x equals two, plug it back into the equation; it should balance out."}

Work through problems from your N-C-E-R-T textbook (especially exercise four point three) and solve previous years' question papers. Start with simpler problems and gradually increase the difficulty level. Online resources like Khan Academy and Vedantu offer excellent tutorials and practice exercises. Don't hesitate to ask your teachers or classmates for help when you get stuck on a problem. Good luck with your boards!"}
