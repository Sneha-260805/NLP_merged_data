{"unnormalised": "At its core, algebra employs symbols to represent numbers, quantities, and relationships. These symbols, often denoted by letters such as ‘x’, ‘y’, and ‘z’, are referred to as variables. Expressions are formed by combining variables with mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, the expression '3x + 2y - 5' involves two variables and several arithmetic operations. Manipulation of these expressions follows specific rules, based on properties such as associativity, commutativity, and distributivity. These properties, rigorously defined, allows mathematicians and scientists to simplify problems, model real-world phenomena, and draw logical conclusions.", "normalised": "at its core, algebra employs symbols to represent numbers, quantities, and relationships. these symbols, often denoted by letters such as ‘x’, ‘y’, and ‘z’, are referred to as variables. expressions are formed by combining variables with mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. for example, the expression 'three x plus two y minus five' involves two variables and several arithmetic operations. manipulation of these expressions follows specific rules, based on properties such as associativity, commutativity, and distributivity. these properties, rigorously defined, allows mathematicians and scientists to simplify problems, model real-world phenomena, and draw logical conclusions."}
{"unnormalised": "Equations represent a crucial aspect of algebra, forming the basis for problem-solving and mathematical modelling. A simple equation might be 'x + 5 = 10', while a more complex one could be '2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0'. Solving an equation entails finding the values of the unknown variables that satisfy the equality. The techniques employed to solve equations vary depending on their type and complexity. Linear equations, involving variables raised to the power of one, can typically be solved using basic algebraic manipulations. Quadratic equations, on the other hand, often require methods such as factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula (x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a) to obtain solutions.", "normalised": "equations represent a crucial aspect of algebra, forming the basis for problem-solving and mathematical modelling. a simple equation might be 'x plus five equals ten', while a more complex one could be 'two x squared minus three x plus one equals zero'. solving an equation entails finding the values of the unknown variables that satisfy the equality. the techniques employed to solve equations vary depending on their type and complexity. linear equations, involving variables raised to the power of one, can typically be solved using basic algebraic manipulations. quadratic equations, on the other hand, often require methods such as factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula (x equals open bracket negative b plus or minus square root of b squared minus four a c close bracket divided by two a) to obtain solutions."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond basic algebra, advanced topics such as simultaneous equations and inequalities extend the applicability of these concepts. Simultaneous equations involve multiple equations with multiple unknowns, requiring methods such as substitution or elimination to find a unique solution. For instance, solving the system 'x + y = 7 and x - y = 1' involves finding values of ‘x’ and ‘y’ that satisfy both equations. Inequalities, such as 'x > 3' or '2x + 1 < 7', define a range of possible values rather than a single solution, and play a critical role in fields like optimization and constraint satisfaction.", "normalised": "beyond basic algebra, advanced topics such as simultaneous equations and inequalities extend the applicability of these concepts. simultaneous equations involve multiple equations with multiple unknowns, requiring methods such as substitution or elimination to find a unique solution. for instance, solving the system 'x plus y equals seven and x minus y equals one' involves finding values of ‘x’ and ‘y’ that satisfy both equations. inequalities, such as 'x is greater than three' or 'two x plus one is less than seven', define a range of possible values rather than a single solution, and play a critical role in fields like optimization and constraint satisfaction."}
