{"unnormalised": "At its core, algebra is the art of using symbols to represent unknown quantities. These symbols, typically denoted as x, y, or z, allow us to formulate relationships and solve for these unknowns. The fundamental operations of arithmetic – addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division – are extended to these symbolic representations. For example, the expression \"2x + 3 = 7\" represents a simple linear equation where 'x' is the unknown variable, and the goal is to determine the value of 'x' that satisfies this equation.", "normalised": "At its core, algebra is the art of using symbols to represent unknown quantities.

{"unnormalised": "Equations, in their simplest form, are statements that assert the equality of two expressions. Solving an equation involves manipulating these expressions using algebraic rules until the unknown variable is isolated on one side of the equation. Consider the aforementioned equation, 2x + 3 = 7. To solve for 'x', we first subtract 3 from both sides, resulting in 2x = 4. Then, dividing both sides by 2 yields x = 2. This solution signifies that when x equals 2, the equation holds true.", "normalised": "Equations, in their simplest form, are statements that assert the equality of two expressions.

{"unnormalised": "Linear equations, such as the one demonstrated above, are characterized by variables raised to the power of 1. More complex algebraic expressions involve quadratic equations, which contain variables raised to the power of 2. A general form of a quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. The solutions to quadratic equations can be obtained using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). For instance, in the equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, applying the quadratic formula with a=1, b=-5, and c=6 will yield 2 solutions.", "normalised": "Linear equations, such as the one demonstrated above, are characterized by variables raised to the power of one.

{"unnormalised": "Systems of equations involve multiple equations with multiple unknowns. These systems can be solved using various techniques, including substitution, elimination, and matrix methods. For example, consider the following system: x + y = 5, and x - y = 1. Using the substitution method, we can solve for 'x' in the first equation (x = 5 - y) and substitute this expression into the second equation, which yields (5 - y) - y = 1. Simplifying, we get 5 - 2y = 1, which leads to y = 2. Substituting y = 2 back into the first equation gives x + 2 = 5, hence x = 3.", "normalised": "Systems of equations involve multiple equations with multiple unknowns.

{"unnormalised": "Algebraic identities are fundamental equations that hold true for all values of the variables involved. These identities provide shortcuts for simplifying expressions and solving equations. Prominent examples include (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, and a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b).
