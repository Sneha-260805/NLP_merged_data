{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about solving algebraic equations, right? It's not as scary as it looks, bhai. Let's break it down. First, understand the basic idea: you're trying to find the value of a variable (usually 'x') that makes the equation true. Think of it like a balance scale – whatever you do to one side, you gotta do to the other to keep it balanced.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about solving algebraic equations, right?

{"unnormalised": "For example, a simple equation: x + 5 = 10. To find 'x', you need to isolate it. Subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5, which simplifies to x = 5. See? Easy peasy! Now, let's say you have something like 2x = 12. Here, 'x' is being multiplied by 2. To isolate 'x', divide both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 12 / 2, which simplifies to x = 6.", "normalised": "For example, a simple equation: x plus five equals ten. To find 'x', you need to isolate it. Subtract five from both sides: x plus five minus five equals ten minus five, which simplifies to x equals five. See? Easy peasy! Now, let's say you have something like two x equals twelve. Here, 'x' is being multiplied by two. To isolate 'x', divide both sides by two: two x divided by two equals twelve divided by two, which simplifies to x equals six."}
{"unnormalised": "Things get a bit more complicated with equations like 3x + 2 = 11. First, subtract 2 from both sides: 3x + 2 - 2 = 11 - 2, which gives you 3x = 9. Then, divide both sides by 3: 3x / 3 = 9 / 3, so x = 3. Don't forget the order of operations – generally, undo addition/subtraction before multiplication/division.", "normalised": "Things get a bit more complicated with equations like three x plus two equals eleven. First, subtract two from both sides: three x plus two minus two equals eleven minus two, which gives you three x equals nine. Then, divide both sides by three: three x divided by three equals nine divided by three, so x equals three. Don't forget the order of operations – generally, undo addition or subtraction before multiplication or division."}
{"unnormalised": "Practice makes perfect, yaar. Try solving these: 4x - 7 = 9, 5x + 3 = 18, and x / 2 + 1 = 6. The answers are x = 4, x = 3, and x = 10 respectively, so you can check your work. Once you get the hang of these single-variable equations, you can move on to more complex stuff like quadratic equations (e.g., x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0) or systems of equations. All the best!", "normalised": "Practice makes perfect, yaar. Try solving these: four x minus seven equals nine, five x plus three equals eighteen, and x divided by two plus one equals six. The answers are x equals four, x equals three, and x equals ten respectively, so you can check your work. Once you get the hang of these single-variable equations, you can move on to more complex stuff like quadratic equations (e.g., x squared plus five x plus six equals zero) or systems of equations.
