{"unnormalised": "That night, I stayed up late practicing. I started with simple linear equations, then moved onto more complex ones with fractions and decimals. I even tackled some simultaneous equations, like trying to solve for 'x' and 'y' when given '2x + y = 7' and 'x - y = 2'. It was slow going, but with each solved equation, my confidence grew. I realised algebra wasn't some abstract monster, but a set of tools, much like the spanners my dad used to fix our old Maruti 800.", "normalised": "That night, I stayed up late practicing.

Whether it’s calculating marketing ROI using a formula like \"ROI = (Revenue - Cost)/Cost * 100\" or predicting sales trends based on historical data, the ability to manipulate equations and solve for unknowns is invaluable. Looking back, I'm grateful for Priya's help and the persistence I mustered.
