I recall one particularly frustrating evening, struggling with a quadratic equation. The problem was: If (x+2)^2 = 25, solve for x. Seemed simple enough, on paper. But after what felt like hours of scribbling and erasing, I was nowhere closer to the answer.", "normalised": "Suddenly, there were these mysterious letters – x, y, z – standing in for things.

He sat beside me, patiently walking me through the steps, explaining the concept of factoring and roots. \"Think of x as a hidden treasure,\" he said, \"and the equation as a map. You just need to follow the clues.\" Turns out x could be 3, or -7. Who knew?", "normalised": "My father, a retired railway engineer, noticed my distress.
