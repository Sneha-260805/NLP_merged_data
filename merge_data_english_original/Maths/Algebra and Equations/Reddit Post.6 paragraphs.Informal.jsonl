{"unnormalised": "Maybe I should try simplifying one equation first? Like, try to get ‘y’ by itself in one of them? Or is there some magic formula I'm forgetting? Lol. I'm aiming to score 90+% in the boards, but with problems like these, I'm not so sure anymore! Wish me luck and please give me some hints.", "normalised": "Maybe I should try simplifying one equation first? Like, try to get 'y' by itself in one of them?
