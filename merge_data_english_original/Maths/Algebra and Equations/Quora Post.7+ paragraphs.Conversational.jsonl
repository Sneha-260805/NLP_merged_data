{"unnormalised": "Like, for example, I saw a question recently: \"Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15\". Seems simple enough, right? But sometimes my brain just freezes up, esp. when I am short on time or stuck on a different problem. It took me a full 2 minutes to realize that, first, you subtract 5 from both sides. And then, divide both sides by 2. So, x = 5. Phew!", "normalised": "Like, for example, I saw a question recently: \"Solve for x: two x plus five equals fifteen\". Seems simple enough, right?

{"unnormalised": "And what about quadratic equations? Those can be a real pain. I remember the quadratic formula from school – something like x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, but remembering it under exam pressure is a different story altogether! The 'b^2 - 4ac' part always gets me mixed up. I often wonder if there's a simpler way to solve them, especially when the numbers aren't so neat and tidy, like in the equation x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0.
