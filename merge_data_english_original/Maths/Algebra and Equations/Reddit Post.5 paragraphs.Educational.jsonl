{"unnormalised": "I've found that using real-world examples helps. Like, I frame word problems around things they know, like ordering samosas and chai at a local shop. If 2 samosas and 1 chai cost Rs. 50, and 3 samosas and 2 chais cost Rs. 85, how much does each samosa and chai cost individually? That way, \"x\" and \"y\" aren't just abstract variables, they represent something relatable. I usually present 3-4 such scenarios.", "normalised": "I have found that using real-world examples helps.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing I do is break down the steps really, really slowly. For example, if the equation is 0.5x + 0.25y = 10 and x - y = 2, I go through each step of isolating one variable, substituting, and solving with them multiple times. I also insist they show their work clearly, labeling each step. No shortcuts allowed until they *really* get it. We also spend 2-3 classes practicing just fractions equations, so something like (1/2)x + (1/3)y = 5 becomes less intimidating.", "normalised": "Another thing I do is break down the steps really, really slowly.

{"unnormalised": "I also visually illustrate the solution using graphs. I use Desmos (it's free!) to show how two equations intersect at one point, representing the solution. This is helpful for visual learners. Also, after solving a system, I make them plug the x and y values back into the original equations to verify the answers. Self-checking is a great habit!", "normalised": "I also visually illustrate the solution using graphs.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, patience is key! Some students will pick it up quickly, while others will need more time and encouragement. I try to create a supportive environment where they feel comfortable asking questions, no matter how basic. And of course, extra practice problems from their NCERT textbook. Typically, I give them 10-15 questions per class. Good luck to all my fellow tutors out there! It can be challenging, but rewarding.", "normalised": "Finally, patience is key!
