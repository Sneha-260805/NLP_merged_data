{"unnormalised": "But how do we *solve* these things? One common way is substitution. Let's say we also know that Priya ate twice as many as Rakesh. That's \"y = 2x\". Now, we can replace the \"y\" in the first equation with \"2x\". So, \"x + 2x = 15\", which simplifies to \"3x = 15\". Divide both sides by 3, and boom! \"x = 5\". Rakesh ate 5 *gulab jamuns*.
