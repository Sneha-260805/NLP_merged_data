{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. For example, `2x + 3 = 7` is a simple algebraic equation. Our goal is typically to find the value of the unknown variable, which in this case is 'x'. Think of it like a balancing act; whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other to maintain the equilibrium.", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics.

{"unnormalised": "One of the first techniques you'll learn is isolating the variable. In the equation `2x + 3 = 7`, we want to get 'x' by itself on one side. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: `2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3`, which simplifies to `2x = 4`. Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: `2x / 2 = 4 / 2`, giving us `x = 2`. Congrats, you've solved your first algebraic equation!", "normalised": "One of the first techniques you'll learn is isolating the variable. In the equation `two x plus three equals seven`, we want to get 'x' by itself on one side. We can do this by subtracting three from both sides of the equation: `two x plus three minus three equals seven minus three`, which simplifies to `two x equals four`. Now, we can divide both sides by two to solve for x: `two x divided by two equals four divided by two`, giving us `x equals two`. Congrats, you've solved your first algebraic equation!"}
{"unnormalised": "Another crucial concept is understanding the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). This tells us the sequence in which to perform calculations. For example, in the expression `3 + 4 * 2`, we multiply 4 by 2 first (which gives us 8), and then add 3, resulting in 11. Getting this wrong will definitely mess up your answers!", "normalised": "Another crucial concept is understanding the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym B-O-D-M-A-S (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's tackle something a bit more complex: solving for 'y' in the equation `3(y - 2) = 12`. First, we need to deal with the brackets. We distribute the 3 across the terms inside the brackets: `3*y - 3*2 = 12`, which simplifies to `3y - 6 = 12`. Next, we add 6 to both sides: `3y - 6 + 6 = 12 + 6`, giving us `3y = 18`. Finally, divide both sides by 3: `3y / 3 = 18 / 3`, resulting in `y = 6`.", "normalised": "Now, let's tackle something a bit more complex: solving for 'y' in the equation `three multiplied by the quantity y minus two equals twelve`. First, we need to deal with the brackets. We distribute the three across the terms inside the brackets: `three multiplied by y minus three multiplied by two equals twelve`, which simplifies to `three y minus six equals twelve`. Next, we add six to both sides: `three y minus six plus six equals twelve plus six`, giving us `three y equals eighteen`. Finally, divide both sides by three: `three y divided by three equals eighteen divided by three`, resulting in `y equals six`."}
{"unnormalised": "Linear equations can also have 2 variables! For instance, finding the points of intersection. Graphically, we can represent the equation `y = 2x + 1`, and `y = x + 3` using a graph to find the values of x, y. Algebraically, `2x + 1 = x + 3`, therefore `x = 2`, `y = 5`.
