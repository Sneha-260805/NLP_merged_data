{"unnormalised": "First, I distributed the 3: 2x + 5 = 3x - 3. Then, I tried to get all the x's on one side, so I subtracted 2x from both sides: 5 = x - 3. After that, I added 3 to both sides to isolate x: 8 = x. So, x = 8. But I did that like 5 times and I only got \"8\" twice.

{"unnormalised": "Any tips or suggestions? I'm particularly bad at algebra. Calculus toh phir bhi theek hai, but algebra… It always gets me.
