{"unnormalised": "One of the most useful tools is the concept of balancing the equation. What you do to one side, you gotta do to the other.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s prepone our discussion to more complex equations. Think about quadratic equations like ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Remember the quadratic formula? x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.

Don’t worry so much about memorizing as about understanding where the parts come from.", "normalised": "Now, let's prepone our discussion to more complex equations.

{"unnormalised": "Simultaneous equations are another common type. Suppose, 2x + y = 8 and x – y = 1. You can solve these using substitution or elimination. Elimination is often quicker. Adding the two equations gets you 3x = 9, therefore x = 3. Then substitute x into one of the equations to find y. In this case, y = 2. Boom! Solved. It’s all about finding tricks that work.", "normalised": "Simultaneous equations are another common type. Suppose, two x plus y equals eight and x minus y equals one.

{"unnormalised": "Don’t forget about word problems! These are where algebra really comes to life. \"If Priya is twice as old as Rakesh, and in 5 yrs Priya will be 3 yrs older than Rakesh. How old is Rakesh now?\" Okay, so lets call Priya's age P and Rakesh's age R. We have two eqns: P=2R and P+5 = R+3. You could rewrite the second equation to be P = R - 2. Substitute P=2R into that to get 2R = R - 2 and thus R= -2. That does not make much sense though. Let us instead say, P+5 = R+3+3, since Priya will be 3 *more* years older than Rakesh, rather than just 3 years older in general. Rewrite that as P = R +1. Put P=2R into there to get R=1. So Rakesh is 1 and Priya is 2.", "normalised": "Don't forget about word problems!
