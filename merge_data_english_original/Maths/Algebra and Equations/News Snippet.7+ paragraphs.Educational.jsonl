{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, experts emphasize the importance of mastering basic arithmetic operations before delving into algebra. A strong foundation in fractions, decimals, and percentages is essential for understanding algebraic concepts like ratios and proportions. Many students struggle with algebra simply because they lack a solid grounding in these fundamental skills. Consider a problem like solving for x in the equation: 2x + 5 = 15. This requires a clear understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.", "normalised": "furthermore, experts emphasize the importance of mastering basic arithmetic operations before delving into algebra. a strong foundation in fractions, decimals, and percentages is essential for understanding algebraic concepts like ratios and proportions. many students struggle with algebra simply because they lack a solid grounding in these fundamental skills. consider a problem like solving for x in the equation: two x plus five equals fifteen. this requires a clear understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."}
{"unnormalised": "The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is considering revising its maths curriculum to incorporate more application-oriented problems and reduce the emphasis on rote learning.
