{"unnormalised": "Algebra, eh? Makes some folks sweat just hearing the word! But honestly, it's not that scary. Think of it like solving puzzles with a few hidden numbers. Remember those 'find x' problems from school? That's basically algebra in a nutshell. Let's say you go to the market and buy 2 kg of apples and a packet of biscuits for ₹50. The total bill is ₹250. How much did the apples cost per kg? We can write that as: 2x + 50 = 250. See? Algebra!", "normalised": "Algebra, eh? Makes some folks sweat just hearing the word! But honestly, it's not that scary.

{"unnormalised": "Now, some equations might look intimidating with all those x's and y's flying around, but the key is to break them down step by step. Take, for example, a quadratic equation like x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0. Looks complicated, right? But remember those factoring techniques your maths teacher, Mrs. Sharma, tried to drill into your head? They're super useful here! This equation can be factored as (x+2)(x+3) = 0, so x = -2 or x = -3. Boom! Problem solved.", "normalised": "Now, some equations might look intimidating with all those x's and y's flying around, but the key is to break them down step by step.

{"unnormalised": "One common area where people get tripped up is dealing with inequalities. It's not just about equals anymore! Imagine you're planning a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur, which is approx 280 km. You want to be there in less than 4 hours. What average speed do you need to maintain? Well, distance/speed < 4. Which means speed > 280/4, or speed > 70 km/hr. Make sure to account for traffic though, you might need a little buffer.", "normalised": "One common area where people get tripped up is dealing with inequalities. It's not just about equals anymore! Imagine you're planning a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur, which is approximately two hundred and eighty kilometer. You want to be there in less than four hours. What average speed do you need to maintain? Well, distance divided by speed less than four. Which means speed greater than two hundred and eighty divided by four, or speed greater than seventy kilometer per hour. Make sure to account for traffic though, you might need a little buffer."}
{"unnormalised": "Another useful bit in Algebra is Simultaneous Equations. Imagine a situation where you have 2 unknowns and 2 equations, for example x+y=10 and x-y = 2. Using elimination method, adding both equations leads to 2x = 12 or x=6. Substituting value of x in the first equation gives us 6+y=10 or y=4. Using such concepts in real life problems is what is Algebra is all about.", "normalised": "Another useful bit in Algebra is Simultaneous Equations. Imagine a situation where you have two unknowns and two equations, for example x plus y equals ten and x minus y equals two.

{"unnormalised": "So, don't let algebra intimidate you. Practice regularly, break down the problems into smaller steps, and remember those formulas. And who knows, maybe you'll even start enjoying those 'find x' puzzles. Keep solving! You might even find that your logic skills improve, helping you with other aspects of life, from negotiating a price with the rickshaw-wala to understanding complex investment options.", "normalised": "So, don't let algebra intimidate you.
