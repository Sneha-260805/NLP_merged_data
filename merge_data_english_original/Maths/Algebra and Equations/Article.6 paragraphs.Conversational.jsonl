{"unnormalised": "The trick is to isolate \"x\" on one side of the equation. Remember that golden rule from school: whatever you do to one side, you gotta do to the other! So, in our example, the 1st thing we should do is subtract 5 from both sides. That gives us: 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5.

{"unnormalised": "Now, \"2x\" really means \"2 times x.\" To get \"x\" by itself, we need to divide both sides by 2. So: 2x / 2 = 10 / 2. And guess what? That simplifies to x = 5!

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's try something a bit trickier. How about 3(x - 2) = 9? Don't panic! The first step here is to distribute the 3 across the (x - 2). That means multiplying 3 by both \"x\" and \"-2.\" So, we get 3x - 6 = 9. The distributive property, remember?", "normalised": "Now, let's try something a bit trickier. How about three open parenthesis x minus two close parenthesis equals nine? Don't panic! The first step here is to distribute the three across the open parenthesis x minus two close parenthesis. That means multiplying three by both \"x\" and \"minus two.\" So, we get three x minus six equals nine. The distributive property, remember?"}
{"unnormalised": "Next, we want to get rid of that \"-6.\" To do that, we add 6 to both sides: 3x - 6 + 6 = 9 + 6. That simplifies to 3x = 15. And finally, just like before, we divide both sides by 3: 3x / 3 = 15 / 3. The result? x = 5. Again! Sometimes the answer is the same even with a different question, right?", "normalised": "Next, we want to get rid of that \"minus six.\" To do that, we add six to both sides: three x minus six plus six equals nine plus six.

Sometimes the answer is the same even with a different question, right?"}
