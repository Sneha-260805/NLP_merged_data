{"unnormalised": "At its core, algebra uses symbols, mainly letters (like x, y, and z), to represent unknown numbers or variables. Imagine you're buying samosas for your friends. If each samosa costs Rs. 15 and you don't know how many you need, you can represent the number of samosas with 'x'. The total cost then becomes 15x.

{"unnormalised": "Think of inverse operations as undoing steps. In our equation, we have addition (+5) and multiplication (2x). To isolate 'x', we first undo the addition by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5, which simplifies to 2x = 10. Notice how subtracting 5 from both sides keeps the equation balanced – it's like a seesaw!", "normalised": "Think of inverse operations as undoing steps. In our equation, we have addition (plus five) and multiplication (two x).

Notice how subtracting five from both sides keeps the equation balanced – it's like a seesaw!"}
{"unnormalised": "Next, we undo the multiplication by dividing both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 10 / 2, which gives us x = 5. So, the number of samosas you need is 5! The total cost will be Rs. 75, since 15 x 5 = 75. See? We solved for 'x'!", "normalised": "Next, we undo the multiplication by dividing both sides by two: two x divided by two equals ten divided by two, which gives us x equals five. So, the number of samosas you need is five! The total cost will be rupees seventy five, since fifteen multiplied by five equals seventy five. See? We solved for 'x'!"}
{"unnormalised": "Linear equations are those where the highest power of the variable is 1 (like our 2x + 5 = 15 example). Solving them involves isolating the variable using inverse operations. Quadratic equations, on the other hand, involve a variable raised to the power of 2 (like x^2). They are a bit trickier but follow similar principles. For example: x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0.", "normalised": "Linear equations are those where the highest power of the variable is one (like our two x plus five equals fifteen example).

{"unnormalised": "One handy trick for quadratic equations is factoring. Sometimes, you can rewrite the equation as a product of two expressions. In our example, x^2 + 4x + 4 can be factored into (x + 2)(x + 2) = 0. This means either (x + 2) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0, so x = -2. It’s all about finding the right pattern and breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. Once you practice enough, solving equations is a cakewalk. The important thing is to understand the concepts rather than just memorizing formulas. Don't be afraid to make mistakes – they're part of the learning process. So, grab a pencil, a notebook, and get ready to explore the amazing world of algebra! Good luck, and happy solving!", "normalised": "One handy trick for quadratic equations is factoring.
