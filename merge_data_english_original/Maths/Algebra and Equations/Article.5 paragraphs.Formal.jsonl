{"unnormalised": "One fundamental concept is that of variables and coefficients. Variables, typically denoted as x, y, or z, represent unknown quantities that we aim to determine. Coefficients are the numerical values that multiply these variables. For example, in the linear equation 3x + 5 = 14, 'x' is the variable, '3' is the coefficient of 'x', and '5' and '14' are constants. Solving such an equation involves isolating 'x' on one side, which can be achieved through operations like subtracting '5' from both sides and then dividing by '3'. The solution in this case is x=3.", "normalised": "One fundamental concept is that of variables and coefficients.

{"unnormalised": "Simultaneous equations involve multiple equations with multiple variables, requiring us to find a set of values that satisfy all equations simultaneously. A common method for solving these is substitution, where we solve one equation for one variable and then substitute that expression into the other equations. Another approach is elimination, where we manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable at a time.
