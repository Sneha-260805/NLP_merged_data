{"unnormalised": "Specifically, when using the substitution method, I isolate x in the first equation, obtaining x = 10 - y. Substituting this into the second equation yields (10 - y) - y = 2, which simplifies to 10 - 2y = 2. Solving for y, I get y = 4. Substituting y = 4 back into x = 10 - y, I find x = 6. So, a solution of (x,y) = (6,4). Is this the correct approach?", "normalised": "Specifically, when using the substitution method, I isolate x in the first equation, obtaining x equals ten minus y. Substituting this into the second equation yields open parenthesis ten minus y close parenthesis minus y equals two, which simplifies to ten minus two y equals two. Solving for y, I get y equals four. Substituting y equals four back into x equals ten minus y, I find x equals six. So, a solution of open parenthesis x comma y close parenthesis equals open parenthesis six comma four close parenthesis. Is this the correct approach?"}
{"unnormalised": "Moreover, I'm curious if there are alternative methods or techniques that might be more efficient or elegant for solving this type of system. The textbook suggests using matrices, but I'm not very proficient at that yet. Are there any online resources or tutorials that you would recommend for mastering this topic? Any help would be greatly appreciated. My professor, Dr. Sharma, mentioned something about Cramer's Rule, but I'm not quite sure how it applies in this context.", "normalised": "Moreover, I am curious if there are alternative methods or techniques that might be more efficient or elegant for solving this type of system.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, could anyone shed light on the geometric interpretation of solving a system of linear equations? I understand that each equation represents a line, but I'm struggling to visualize how the solution corresponds to the intersection point of these lines. Perhaps a simple illustration or example would be helpful. I am self-studying, so any help is greatly appreciated.
