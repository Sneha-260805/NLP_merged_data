{"unnormalised": "My Class 10 algebra exam. Just thinking about it sends a shiver down my spine, even now. It wasn't the math itself, honestly. I’d diligently attended tuition with Sharma Sir, wrestled with quadratic equations until 11 PM most nights, and could recite the quadratic formula almost backwards. The problem was application, translating those abstract ‘x’s and ‘y’s into real-world scenarios.", "normalised": "my class ten algebra exam. just thinking about it sends a shiver down my spine, even now. it wasn't the math itself, honestly. i’d diligently attended tuition with sharma sir, wrestled with quadratic equations until eleven p.m. most nights, and could recite the quadratic formula almost backwards. the problem was application, translating those abstract ‘x’s and ‘y’s into real-world scenarios."}
{"unnormalised": "The question that threw me was about finding the dimensions of a rectangular garden. The area was given as something like x^2 + 5x + 6 sq meters, and we had to factorize it to find the length and breadth in terms of ‘x’. Sounds straightforward now, but then, faced with the pressure, the numbers just blurred. My mind went blank, I kept staring at the question trying to figure out what to do. It wasn’t even that hard!", "normalised": "the question that threw me was about finding the dimensions of a rectangular garden. the area was given as something like x squared plus five x plus six square meters, and we had to factorize it to find the length and breadth in terms of ‘x’. sounds straightforward now, but then, faced with the pressure, the numbers just blurred. my mind went blank, i kept staring at the question trying to figure out what to do. it wasn’t even that hard!"}
{"unnormalised": "Frustration mounted. I glanced at the clock, 1 hour had already passed. Some of my classmates were already handing in their answer sheets! Panic started to set in. I chewed on my pen, scribbled some random numbers, erased them, and scribbled again. The ‘x’s and ‘y’s seemed to mock me from the page.", "normalised": "frustration mounted. i glanced at the clock, one hour had already passed. some of my classmates were already handing in their answer sheets! panic started to set in. i chewed on my pen, scribbled some random numbers, erased them, and scribbled again. the ‘x’s and ‘y’s seemed to mock me from the page."}
{"unnormalised": "Then, a divine intervention, in the form of a samosa. Okay, not literally divine, but close enough. During the short break, my friend Priya had shared her tiffin, and that one bite of perfectly spiced, crispy samosa somehow unlocked a dormant part of my brain. I don't even know why.", "normalised": "then, a divine intervention, in the form of a samosa. okay, not literally divine, but close enough. during the short break, my friend priya had shared her tiffin, and that one bite of perfectly spiced, crispy samosa somehow unlocked a dormant part of my brain. i don't even know why."}
{"unnormalised": "I started thinking about the samosa. The triangular shape reminded me of geometry, sure, but then I thought about dividing the samosa equally amongst 3 friends. Suddenly, the idea of factors clicked! I visualized the rectangular garden problem not as some abstract mathematical problem, but as a practical division problem. If x^2 + 5x + 6 could be factored into (x+2)(x+3), then those were the possible dimensions of the garden! Length = (x+3) meters and Breadth = (x+2) meters.", "normalised": "i started thinking about the samosa. the triangular shape reminded me of geometry, sure, but then i thought about dividing the samosa equally amongst three friends. suddenly, the idea of factors clicked! i visualized the rectangular garden problem not as some abstract mathematical problem, but as a practical division problem. if x squared plus five x plus six could be factored into open parenthesis x plus two close parenthesis open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis, then those were the possible dimensions of the garden! length equals open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis meters and breadth equals open parenthesis x plus two close parenthesis meters."}
{"unnormalised": "With renewed confidence, I tackled the remaining problems. One involved solving simultaneous equations to find the cost of 2 pens and 3 notebooks, given their combined prices, with costs such as Rs. 150.50 and Rs. 225.75. Another wanted me to find the value of k in a polynomial equation if one of the roots was x=2, it had some nasty coefficient like 3.5k – 2. I managed to solve each of them methodically, applying the principles Sharma Sir had drilled into us. I even used some of the extra time to double-check my calculations.", "normalised": "with renewed confidence, i tackled the remaining problems. one involved solving simultaneous equations to find the cost of two pens and three notebooks, given their combined prices, with costs such as rupees one hundred and fifty point five zero and rupees two hundred and twenty five point seven five. another wanted me to find the value of k in a polynomial equation if one of the roots was x equals two, it had some nasty coefficient like three point five k minus two. i managed to solve each of them methodically, applying the principles sharma sir had drilled into us. i even used some of the extra time to double-check my calculations."}
{"unnormalised": "I ended up scoring 92/100. Not perfect, but a victory nonetheless. More importantly, I learned that day that sometimes, the solution to a complex problem isn't in the textbook, but in the simple joys of life - a shared samosa, a moment of calm, or a fresh perspective. And maybe, just maybe, next time I'll prepone my samosa break.", "normalised": "i ended up scoring ninety two divided by one hundred. not perfect, but a victory nonetheless. more importantly, i learned that day that sometimes, the solution to a complex problem isn't in the textbook, but in the simple joys of life - a shared samosa, a moment of calm, or a fresh perspective. and maybe, just maybe, next time i'll prepone my samosa break."}
