{"unnormalised": "A recent study by the Indian Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IIMS), Chennai, has revealed some interesting trends in how students are tackling algebra these days. Turns out, the old-school methods are still holding strong, but there's a definite rise in the use of online tools and apps for solving equations. Think Khan Academy, Vedantu, and BYJU's – these are becoming the go-to for a lot of students facing quadratic equations, linear equations, and systems of equations.", "normalised": "A recent study by the Indian Institute of Mathematical Sciences (I-I-M-S), Chennai, has revealed some interesting trends in how students are tackling algebra these days.

{"unnormalised": "The study, which surveyed over 5000 students from various schools across India, showed that approximately 65% still rely on the traditional textbook method for learning basic algebraic concepts. However, when it comes to solving more complex problems, like those involving logarithms or matrices (which, let's be honest, can be a real headache), almost 40% turn to online resources. That's a significant jump, indicating a growing acceptance of tech-based learning in the realm of mathematics.", "normalised": "The study, which surveyed over five thousand students from various schools across India, showed that approximately sixty five percent still rely on the traditional textbook method for learning basic algebraic concepts.

Sharma, lead researcher at IIMS, commented, \"We observed that students often find the visual representations and interactive exercises offered by these online platforms particularly helpful. They can see the equations in action, manipulate variables, and get instant feedback, which is something a textbook alone cannot provide.\"", "normalised": "Doctor R.K.

{"unnormalised": "The report also highlighted a correlation between the use of online tools and improved test scores. Students who regularly utilized these resources scored an average of 15 marks higher on their algebra exams compared to those who relied solely on traditional methods. This suggests that integrating technology into maths education could be a game-changer for many students.", "normalised": "The report also highlighted a correlation between the use of online tools and improved test scores.

{"unnormalised": "Interestingly, the study also delved into the types of algebraic problems that students found most challenging. Solving simultaneous equations with 3 variables, word problems involving age or work rates, and factorizing complex expressions topped the list. Seems like these are the areas where extra attention and innovative teaching methods are needed.", "normalised": "Interestingly, the study also delved into the types of algebraic problems that students found most challenging.

They aim to explore how these tools can be effectively integrated into the classroom curriculum and whether they can help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
