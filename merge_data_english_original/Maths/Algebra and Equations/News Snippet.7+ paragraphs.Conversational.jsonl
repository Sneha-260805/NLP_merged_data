{"unnormalised": "According to sources at the Education Ministry, this isn’t about “dumbing down” the curriculum. It’s about making Maths more engaging and less of a chore. They want students to actually *enjoy* learning the subject, not just memorize formulas. Makes sense, doesn’t it? No one wants to be stuck solving simultaneous equations at a wedding or something.", "normalised": "According to sources at the Education Ministry, this isn’t about “dumbing down” the curriculum.

{"unnormalised": "One of the changes includes less emphasis on complex factorization problems. They're still going to cover it, of course, but not in as much depth. Instead, there will be a greater focus on understanding linear equations and their applications in graphing and data analysis. \"Linear equations like y=2x+3 are far more applicable,\" said one official involved in the curriculum revision.", "normalised": "One of the changes includes less emphasis on complex factorization problems.

The feedback from these schools will be used to further refine the curriculum before it's implemented across the board.
