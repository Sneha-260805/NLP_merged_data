{"unnormalised": "The core of their technique lies in a modified form of Gaussian elimination, incorporating what they term \"contextual approximation.\" This involves identifying and simplifying terms based on their relative magnitude within the equation. For instance, a term like 0.001x can be effectively ignored when x is expected to be in the range of 10^6, without significantly affecting the overall solution. \"We've seen impressive results applying this to scenarios with constraints,\" stated Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a contributing researcher.", "normalised": "The core of their technique lies in a modified form of Gaussian elimination, incorporating what they term \"contextual approximation.\" This involves identifying and simplifying terms based on their relative magnitude within the equation.
