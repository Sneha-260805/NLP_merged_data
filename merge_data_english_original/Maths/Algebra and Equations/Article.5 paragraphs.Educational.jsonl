{"unnormalised": "Algebra and equations form the bedrock of mathematical understanding, providing tools to solve a wide range of problems. Understanding these concepts begins with recognizing variables, which are typically represented by letters like x, y, or z. These variables stand in for unknown quantities, and the goal of algebra is often to find the value of these unknowns. Equations, on the other hand, are mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions. For example, the equation 2x + 3 = 7 shows that the expression on the left, 2x + 3, has the same value as the expression on the right, 7. Solving equations involves manipulating both sides to isolate the variable and determine its value. Many students find this difficult initially, often getting stuck on problems like (3x^2 + 2y)/5 = 8 when 'y' is known.", "normalised": "Algebra and equations form the bedrock of mathematical understanding, providing tools to solve a wide range of problems.

{"unnormalised": "Linear equations are the simplest type of equations, where the highest power of the variable is 1. A classic example is ax + b = 0, where 'a' and 'b' are constants. Solving this involves subtracting 'b' from both sides, giving ax = -b, and then dividing by 'a' to find x = -b/a. Quadratic equations, however, are a bit more complex. They have the general form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. One common method for solving quadratic equations is factoring. For instance, x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 can be factored into (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. Setting each factor to zero gives x = -2 or x = -3. Alternatively, the quadratic formula, x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, can be used to find the solutions regardless of whether the equation can be easily factored.", "normalised": "Linear equations are the simplest type of equations, where the highest power of the variable is one.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond linear and quadratic equations, there are systems of equations. These involve two or more equations with multiple variables. For instance, consider the system: x + y = 5 and x - y = 1. There are several methods to solve such systems. The substitution method involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting that expression into the other equation. Alternatively, the elimination method involves adding or subtracting multiples of the equations to eliminate one variable. In this case, adding the two equations eliminates y, giving 2x = 6, so x = 3.

Simplification often involves applying the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates the sequence of calculations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
