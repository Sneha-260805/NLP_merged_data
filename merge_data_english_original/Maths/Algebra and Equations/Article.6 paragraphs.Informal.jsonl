{"unnormalised": "First up, equations. An equation is basically a statement saying that 2 things are equal. Like, 2 + 3 = 5. Pretty simple, right? But then algebra throws in 'x's and 'y's to make it interesting. Something like x + 5 = 10. Your job is to find out what 'x' is. In this case, x = 5. Boom! You're already doing algebra. Equations come in all shapes and sizes, from linear ones (just x to the power of 1), to quadratic ones (x squared, written as x^2) to even more complicated stuff. Remember solving those in class 10? Good times (or maybe not!).", "normalised": "First up, equations. An equation is basically a statement saying that two things are equal. Like, two plus three equals five. Pretty simple, right?

{"unnormalised": "And what about those pesky word problems? A classic is something like, \"If Priya has 'x' apples, and Rakesh gives her 3 more, and now she has 7, how many apples did Priya start with?\". These are meant to be confusing, but all you gotta do is translate the words into equations. Priya starts with x apples. Rakesh gives her 3, so x + 3. And that equals 7, so x + 3 = 7. Solve for x, and you get x = 4. Priya started with 4 apples. See? Not so hard!", "normalised": "And what about those pesky word problems?

{"unnormalised": "Polynomials are another beast. They're just longer expressions with multiple terms. For example, 3x^2 + 2x - 1. It might look scary but it’s not. Treat each part separately.

{"unnormalised": "One thing that always tripped me up was systems of equations, where you have 2 or 3 equations with 2 or 3 unknowns. Like: x + y = 5, and x - y = 1. To solve these, you can use substitution (solve one equation for one variable and plug it into the other) or elimination (add or subtract the equations to get rid of one variable). There are even matrix ways to solve this, but we won't go into that today. Its useful to work out different equations and problems because some problems can be solved only using certain methods.", "normalised": "One thing that always tripped me up was systems of equations, where you have two or three equations with two or three unknowns.
