{"unnormalised": "Now, there are a few main ways to crack these. Firstly, factorization. This works best when the numbers are nice and tidy.

{"unnormalised": "But what if factorization becomes a headache? That’s where the quadratic formula comes in. It's a bit of a mouthful, but trust me, it's your best friend. It goes like this: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. Remember that '±' sign means you get two answers – one with a plus and one with a minus. So, if you have an equation like 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0, you just plug in a=2, b=3, and c=-5 into the formula and boom – you’ve got your answer. You can definitely check that with your calculator.", "normalised": "But what if factorization becomes a headache? That’s where the quadratic formula comes in.

{"unnormalised": "And there’s also completing the square. Yeh thoda sa tricky hai, but it's worth knowing. Basically, you're manipulating the equation to create a perfect square trinomial. Let’s say you’ve got x^2 + 6x + 2 = 0. You add and subtract (6/2)^2 which is 9. Then you rewrite it as (x+3)^2 -7 = 0, which means x = -3 ± sqrt(7).", "normalised": "And there’s also completing the square. This is a little bit tricky, but it's worth knowing.
