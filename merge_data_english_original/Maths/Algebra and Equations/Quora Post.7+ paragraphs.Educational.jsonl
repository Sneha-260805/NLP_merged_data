{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's a Quora post about Algebra and Equations, formatted as requested, with an educational tone, Indian context, and appropriately unnormalized data points.", "normalised": "Someone asked about solving algebraic equations, especially the tricky ones we see in competitive exams. It's a great question! A lot of students, even those scoring ninety percent in their tenth boards, struggle when they first encounter 'word problems' that need to be translated into equations. Let's break down the basics and then tackle some examples."}
{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "First, understand that algebra is just using letters to represent numbers you don't know yet. That 'x', 'y', or 'z' you see? They're just placeholders. An equation is simply a statement that two things are equal. So, two x plus three equals seven is saying that \"two times a number, plus three, equals seven.\" Our goal is to find what that number ('x' in this case) is."}

A lot of students, even those scoring 90% in their 10th boards, struggle when they first encounter 'word problems' that need to be translated into equations.

For example, in two x plus three equals seven, we can subtract three from both sides. This gives us two x equals four. Then, we divide both sides by two, resulting in x equals two. Easy, right?"}

So, 2x + 3 = 7 is saying that \"two times a number, plus three, equals seven.\" Our goal is to find what that number ('x' in this case) *is*.", "normalised": "Now, let's look at a slightly harder example. Suppose we have an equation like x plus two divided by three equals five. Here, we first multiply both sides by three to get rid of the denominator. So, we have x plus two equals fifteen. Then we subtract two from each side resulting in x equals thirteen."}
{"unnormalised": "The golden rule of equations is: whatever you do to one side, you *must* do to the other. This maintains the balance. For example, in 2x + 3 = 7, we can subtract 3 from both sides. This gives us 2x = 4. Then, we divide both sides by 2, resulting in x = 2. Easy, right?", "normalised": "What about simultaneous equations? These involve two or more equations with two or more unknowns. A common method to solve these is substitution. Suppose you are given, x plus y equals ten and x minus y equals four. From the first equation, we can rewrite as x equals ten minus y. Now substitute this into the second equation to get ten minus y minus y equals four."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let's look at a slightly harder example. Suppose we have an equation like (x + 2)/3 = 5. Here, we first multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator. So, we have x + 2 = 15. Then we subtract 2 from each side resulting in x= 13.", "normalised": "Solving this gives us ten minus two y equals four or minus two y equals minus six or y equals three. Then, substituting y equals three into x plus y equals ten equation gives us x plus three equals ten or x equals seven. Thus x equals seven and y equals three."}
{"unnormalised": "What about simultaneous equations? These involve two or more equations with two or more unknowns. A common method to solve these is substitution. Suppose you are given, x+y = 10 and x-y = 4. From the first equation, we can rewrite as x = 10 - y. Now substitute this into the 2nd equation to get (10-y)-y =4.", "normalised": "And finally consider the quadratic equations. One famous example of such equations is: x squared plus five x plus six equals zero. To solve this we can split the middle term five x as three x plus two x. Therefore we get x squared plus three x plus two x plus six equals zero, or, x open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis plus two open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis equals zero, or, open parenthesis x plus two close parenthesis open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis equals zero. Hence the answers are x equals minus two or minus three."}
{"unnormalised": "Solving this gives us 10-2y=4 or -2y = -6 or y=3. Then, substituting y=3 into x+y=10 equation gives us x+3 = 10 or x= 7.

Therefore we get x^2 + 3x + 2x +6 = 0, or, x(x+3) + 2(x+3) =0 , or, (x+2)(x+3) = 0. Hence the answers are x = -2 or -3.", "normalised": ""}
