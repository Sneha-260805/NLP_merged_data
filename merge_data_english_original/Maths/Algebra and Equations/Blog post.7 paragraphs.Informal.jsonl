{"unnormalised": "First off, remember BODMAS? Or PEMDAS, or whatever acronym your school uses. It's crucial! Forgetting to do brackets *first* can completely mess up your answer. Seriously. So, if you’ve got something like 2 x (3 + 5), do the (3 + 5) = 8 first, then multiply by 2. The final answer is 16. Not 2 x 3 + 5 = 11. See the difference? It is huge!!", "normalised": "First off, remember B-O-D-M-A-S? Or P-E-M-D-A-S, or whatever acronym your school uses. It's crucial!

{"unnormalised": "Solving for x? Great! But remember to do the same thing on *both* sides of the equation. If you add 5 to one side, you *have* to add 5 to the other side.
