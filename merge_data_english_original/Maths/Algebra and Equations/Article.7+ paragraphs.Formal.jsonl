{"unnormalised": "At its core, an algebraic equation asserts the equality of two expressions, typically involving one or more variables. These variables, often denoted by letters such as 'x', 'y', or 'z', represent unknown quantities that we aim to determine. The goal of solving an algebraic equation is to find the value(s) of the variable(s) that satisfy the equation, making the statement true. For example, the equation '3x + 5 = 14' seeks the value of 'x' that, when multiplied by 3 and added to 5, yields 14.", "normalised": "At its core, an algebraic equation asserts the equality of two expressions, typically involving one or more variables.

{"unnormalised": "The process of solving algebraic equations involves a series of carefully applied operations designed to isolate the variable of interest. These operations, guided by the fundamental properties of equality, include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It is imperative to apply each operation equally to both sides of the equation to maintain the balance and ensure the validity of the solution. In the example of '3x + 5 = 14', we would first subtract 5 from both sides, resulting in '3x = 9', then divide both sides by 3 to obtain 'x = 3'.", "normalised": "The process of solving algebraic equations involves a series of carefully applied operations designed to isolate the variable of interest.
