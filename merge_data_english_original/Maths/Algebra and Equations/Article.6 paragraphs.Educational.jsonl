{"unnormalised": "One fundamental concept is the linear equation, often expressed as 'y = mx + c'. Here, 'm' represents the slope of the line and 'c' is the y-intercept. For instance, if we have the equation y = 2x + 3, the slope is 2 and the line crosses the y-axis at 3. Solving a system of linear equations, such as 2x + y = 7 and x - y = 2, involves finding values for 'x' and 'y' that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Methods like substitution or elimination are commonly used to achieve this, with the solution in this particular case being x=3 and y=1.", "normalised": "One fundamental concept is the linear equation, often expressed as 'y equals m x plus c'.

{"unnormalised": "Quadratic equations, expressed as ax^2 + bx + c = 0, are another essential topic. The quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, allows us to find the roots of any quadratic equation. For example, in the equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, 'a' is 1, 'b' is -5, and 'c' is 6. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula yields x = 2 or x = 3. Understanding the discriminant, b^2 - 4ac, helps determine the nature of the roots: if it's greater than 0, there are 2 real roots; if it’s 0, there's one real root, and if it's less than 0, the roots are complex.", "normalised": "Quadratic equations, expressed as a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero, are another essential topic. The quadratic formula, x equals open bracket minus b plus or minus square root of b squared minus four a c close bracket divided by two a, allows us to find the roots of any quadratic equation. For example, in the equation x squared minus five x plus six equals zero, 'a' is one, 'b' is minus five, and 'c' is six. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula yields x equals two or x equals three. Understanding the discriminant, b squared minus four a c, helps determine the nature of the roots: if it's greater than zero, there are two real roots; if it’s zero, there's one real root, and if it's less than zero, the roots are complex."}
