{"unnormalised": "According to initial reports from coaching centers across the nation, a significant proportion of students found the questions on linear equations in 3 variables (3x + 2y - z = 5, for example), quadratic equations with complex roots, and inequalities with logarithmic functions notably challenging. One question, involving the solution of a system of equations with determinants equaling 0, was cited by many as being particularly time-consuming.", "normalised": "According to initial reports from coaching centers across the nation, a significant proportion of students found the questions on linear equations in three variables (three x plus two y minus z equals five, for example), quadratic equations with complex roots, and inequalities with logarithmic functions notably challenging.

Spent almost 45 mins on just 3 questions. Hope the cutoff is lowered this year.\" This sentiment was echoed by many others who found the algebraic manipulations required to solve some of the problems unusually complex.", "normalised": "Several students expressed their concerns on social media platforms.

{"unnormalised": "Exam experts have noted that the difficulty level might disproportionately affect students from rural backgrounds who may not have access to the same level of resources and coaching as their urban counterparts. The implications of this disparity are currently being assessed. The difficulty surrounding equations such as (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 seemed far removed from reality for many of these students.", "normalised": "Exam experts have noted that the difficulty level might disproportionately affect students from rural backgrounds who may not have access to the same level of resources and coaching as their urban counterparts.

{"unnormalised": "The controversy surrounding the algebra section highlights the ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of the IIT JEE Advanced as a selection criterion for undergraduate engineering programs. Critics argue that the exam places undue emphasis on mathematical prowess, potentially overlooking other important skills and aptitudes. The debate surrounding formulas such as the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) continues to rage as well, despite its relatively limited role in the exams.", "normalised": "The controversy surrounding the algebra section highlights the ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of the I-I-T J-E-E Advanced as a selection criterion for undergraduate engineering programs.
