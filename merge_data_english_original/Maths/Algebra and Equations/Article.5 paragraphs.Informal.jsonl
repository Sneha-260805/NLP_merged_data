Remember the quadratic formula? x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. It’s like the magical weapon that slays the quadratic demon. Just plug in the values, do a bit of calculation, and boom, you've got your two possible answers. Seriously though, I remember spending countless hours in tuition trying to get this straight.

{"unnormalised": "Let’s talk about systems of equations now, like 2x + y = 7 and x - y = 2. You can solve them using substitution or elimination. Elimination is my fave – just add the equations together to eliminate 'y' and solve for 'x'. Then, plug 'x' back into either equation to find 'y'. It's like solving a puzzle, finding the missing pieces one by one. Just like when Mum asks for the password for the wifi. You gotta go step by step to figure it out, otherwise no Netflix!", "normalised": "Let us talk about systems of equations now, like two x plus y equals seven and x minus y equals two.

These are honestly a bit annoying, I wish there was only one value that 'x' could be.", "normalised": "And then there are inequalities!

It’s not just about solving equations; it’s about developing problem-solving skills that will help you in all aspects of life.
