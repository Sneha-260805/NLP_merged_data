{"unnormalised": "In the equation 2x + 5 = 15, the first step is to subtract 5 from both sides. This keeps the equation balanced. That gives you 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5, simplifying to 2x = 10.", "normalised": "In the equation two x plus five equals fifteen, the first step is to subtract five from both sides. This keeps the equation balanced. That gives you two x plus five minus five equals fifteen minus five, simplifying to two x equals ten."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, you need to get rid of the '2' that's multiplying 'x'. You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. So, 2x / 2 = 10 / 2. This results in x = 5.", "normalised": "Next, you need to get rid of the two that is multiplying x. You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by two. So, two x divided by two equals ten divided by two. This results in x equals five."}
{"unnormalised": "Therefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 15 is x = 5. You can verify this by substituting x = 5 back into the original equation: 2 * 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. If the answer is 15, like the original equation, then your calculations are correct. The final calculation is: \"Q.E.D.\".", "normalised": "Therefore, the solution to the equation two x plus five equals fifteen is x equals five. You can verify this by substituting x equals five back into the original equation: two multiplied by five plus five equals ten plus five equals fifteen. If the answer is fifteen, like the original equation, then your calculations are correct. The final calculation is: \"Q-E-D\"."}
