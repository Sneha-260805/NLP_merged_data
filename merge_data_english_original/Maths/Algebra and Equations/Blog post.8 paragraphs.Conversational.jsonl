{"unnormalised": "Now, how do we read the map? We use operations, but we have to be fair! Think of it like this: whatever you do to one side of the equation, you *must* do to the other.

{"unnormalised": "That gives us \"2x = 4\". See how we're getting closer? Now, 'x' is being multiplied by \"2\". To isolate 'x', we do the opposite – we divide. We divide both sides by \"2\".

{"unnormalised": "Let's try another one: \"3y - 5 = 10\". First, we add \"5\" to both sides: \"3y = 15\". Then, we divide both sides by \"3\": \"y = 5\". Simple, right?

{"unnormalised": "Of course, it gets more complicated – with brackets, variables on both sides, fractions, and all sorts of other fun twists. You might see something like (x+2)^2 = 9 to find x.
