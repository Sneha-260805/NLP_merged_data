{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, I'm kinda stuck on this algebra problem and was hoping someone could help. It's from my kid's maths homework – yeah, I know, *embarrassing* that I can't solve it myself! The question is something like: solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15. Seems simple enough, right? But my brain is just not working after a long day at the office! I need to show my work too, not just the final answer. So, if any of you maths whizzes could give me a step-by-step breakdown, I'd really appreciate it.", "normalised": "Hey guys, I'm kind of stuck on this algebra problem and was hoping someone could help.

{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I’m confused about the proper order of operations. Do I subtract 5 from both sides first, or do I do something else entirely? I seem to remember something about PEMDAS (or BODMAS, is that the same?). I’ve tried looking up similar problems online, but the explanations are all so confusing, using fancy terms and stuff.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what if the equation was a bit more complicated? Like, what if there were parentheses or exponents involved? How would the steps change then?

{"unnormalised": "And BTW, what's the best way to check your answer to make sure you haven't made a silly mistake? Do you just plug the value of x back into the original equation? I've tried that, but sometimes, even when I do that, my answer is still wrong. Maybe I'm messing up the calculations somewhere along the way.
