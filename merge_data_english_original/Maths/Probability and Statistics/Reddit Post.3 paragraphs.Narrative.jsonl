{"unnormalised": "So, I was prepping for my Stats final, right? Total chindi stuff, or so I thought. Spent the whole week cramming formulas. Like, the binomial distribution was making my head spin – nCr, p to the power of x, q to the power of n minus x…it was a nightmare. Even worse was trying to remember the difference between a standard deviation of 2.5 and a variance of 6.25.

First question – bam! – a word problem about drawing balls from a bag. \"What's the probability of picking 3 red balls out of 5, given there are 10 balls total, with 4 being red?\" I looked at it, and my mind just went blank. All those formulas…gone. I vaguely remembered something about combinations, maybe 4C3 divided by 10C5, but couldn’t be sure. Wasted like 15 mins trying to figure that out.", "normalised": "Then came the exam.

Pretty sure I'm gonna need to prepone all my plans, 'cause I'll be re-sitting this one next semester. Anyone else feel like Stats is just a cruel joke played on us by IIT professors?", "normalised": "Ended up just guessing and moving on. Rest of the paper was a blur.
