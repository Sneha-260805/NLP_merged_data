{"unnormalised": "I'm working on a problem set in stats and could use some help understanding a concept. The question involves calculating the probability of drawing 2 Aces consecutively from a standard deck of 52 cards, assuming no replacement. My initial calculation gave me (4/52)*(3/51) which simplifies to 12/2652 or approx. 0.0045. Is this correct? I'm getting tripped up on whether this is the right approach, especially considering the wording of the question.", "normalised": "I am working on a problem set in statistics and could use some help understanding a concept. The question involves calculating the probability of drawing two Aces consecutively from a standard deck of fifty two cards, assuming no replacement. My initial calculation gave me four divided by fifty two multiplied by three divided by fifty one which simplifies to twelve divided by two thousand six hundred and fifty two or approximately zero point zero zero four five. Is this correct? I am getting tripped up on whether this is the right approach, especially considering the wording of the question."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the next part asks about the expected value if drawing 2 Aces yields a reward of Rs. 100 and any other combination results in a loss of Rs. 5. To calculate this, I'm using the formula: E(X) = P(Aces) * Reward + P(Not Aces) * Loss. So it'd be (0.0045 * 100) + (0.9955 * -5). This gives an expected value of -Rs. 4.53. Does this look accurate given the relatively low probability of drawing 2 Aces?", "normalised": "Furthermore, the next part asks about the expected value if drawing two Aces yields a reward of rupee one hundred and any other combination results in a loss of rupee five. To calculate this, I am using the formula: E of X equals P of Aces multiplied by Reward plus P of Not Aces multiplied by Loss. So it would be zero point zero zero four five multiplied by one hundred plus zero point nine nine five five multiplied by minus five. This gives an expected value of minus rupee four point five three. Does this look accurate given the relatively low probability of drawing two Aces?"}

I'm primarily looking for a confirmation on the methodologies being employed and if there are any obvious errors in my computation before I finalize my solutions.
