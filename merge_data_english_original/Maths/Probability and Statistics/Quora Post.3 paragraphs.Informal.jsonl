{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about probability in the class today, and tbh, I was totally blank. Like, what's the deal with all those formulas? Our maths teacher, Mr. Sharma, was explaining Bayes' Theorem - something about P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). My head was spinning! He even gave an example about defective phones in a factory with a 0.05 chance of a phone being faulty, but my brain just wasn't cooperating. Is there an easy way to understand this stuff?", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about probability in the class today, and to be honest, I was totally blank.

{"unnormalised": "Then, there's statistics. We’re calculating standard deviation and variance using datasets like {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. It’s all so abstract. And what's the point of knowing that the mean is 6 and the standard deviation is something like 2.83? Honestly, I’d rather be doing literally anything else, like watching the latest Bollywood movie. I heard there’s some cool new special effects, more interesting than sigma notation for sure.", "normalised": "Then, there is statistics.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, I'm struggling. Any tips on how to make probability and statistics less…scary? Are there some good YouTube channels or online resources that explain this stuff in simple terms? Maybe even some real-world examples that would make it click? I know it’s important for things like data analysis and stuff, but right now, it just feels like a bunch of random numbers and symbols jumbled together.
