{"unnormalised": "Okay, so my maths exam is next week and I'm officially panicking. It's all probabilities and statistics, and honestly, it feels like I'm trying to predict whether my rickshaw-wala will actually use the meter – a situation with a probability hovering somewhere near 0.01. I've even started seeing normal distributions in my chai stains! Is there some secret mantra to actually *understand* this stuff, or am I doomed to just memorize formulas until my brain explodes? Currently, my chances of passing feel roughly equivalent to winning a lottery where the prize is... another maths exam.", "normalised": "Okay, so my maths exam is next week and I'm officially panicking.

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, I’m grappling with things like conditional probability. If I get question 1 right, what's the chance I'll mess up question 2? Apparently, the textbook thinks it's 0.7, which sounds about right given my track record. And then there's standard deviation. Is it me, or does calculating the standard deviation of, say, the number of samosas consumed at a Delhi wedding require a PhD in advanced accounting? I'm starting to think I should just calculate the probability of the exam being cancelled... that's one calculation I'd actually *enjoy* doing. The prof told us, \"You must understand the concepts\" but like, 80% of this seems like abstract concepts, even more so when you think of the actual implications of standard deviation, like the likelihood of me buying another overpriced textbook.", "normalised": "Seriously though, I’m grappling with things like conditional probability.

{"unnormalised": "So, fellow Quorans, help a bhai out! Any tips, tricks, or hilarious anecdotes to make probability and statistics less terrifying? Or, at the very least, tell me a joke about a bell curve... I need something to laugh about before I face the dreaded exam on 28/07! Failing that, any good excuses I can give my parents? A sudden, unexpected love for Bollywood dance that requires immediate, intensive training, perhaps? My current probability of success with that excuse is, sadly, also near zero.", "normalised": "So, fellow Quorans, help a bhai out!
