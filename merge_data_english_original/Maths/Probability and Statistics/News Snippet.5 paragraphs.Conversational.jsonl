{"unnormalised": "The National Education Policy (NEP) aims to fix this. The focus is on \"experiential learning,\" with projects designed to show how probability impacts everyday decisions – like assessing risk or understanding trends. Several schools are trying out new strategies, including incorporating real-world data sets like cricket scores or election results into the curriculum. A pilot program in 5 schools across Delhi showed some promise with a 15% increase in scores after 3 months.", "normalised": "The National Education Policy (N-E-P) aims to fix this.
