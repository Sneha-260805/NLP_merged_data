But mostly, he's unconsciously running statistical analyses all day long. He knows that on Mondays, 70% of his customers want extra sugar. Tuesdays? Ginger chai is the clear favourite, with 60% opting for it. He’s collecting data, baby! He’s building a model, predicting future chai demand! He’s practically a data scientist in disguise! His error rate might be, let’s say, +/- 5%, but hey, for chai, that's acceptable. I mean, someone is always going to say \"bhaiya, thoda aur cheeni\"", "normalised": "Think about it.

Let’s conservatively say 65%, because, well, optimism is our national sport. But even that's based on some heavy-duty stats, isn't it? The bowlers' average economy rate, Virat's batting average, the pitch conditions in Ahmedabad – it's all data! And those commentators? They're practically statistical wizards, throwing around numbers like \"a 75% chance of winning if they take 3 wickets in the next 5 overs.\" Suddenly the guy who never went to statistic classes knows all the things.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about cricket.

Well, let’s just say it's roughly the same as the probability of finding a parking spot in Chandni Chowk on Diwali (less than 0.000000001%). But still, we buy those tickets, don't we? Why? Because even with those dismal odds, there's still a chance, however slim. It's that glimmer of hope, that sliver of statistical possibility, that keeps us going.
