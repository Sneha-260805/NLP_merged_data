According to Dr. Rajesh Kumar, head of the IISA, preliminary calculations showed a p-value of 0.03 for the hypothesis that rural literacy rates have remained constant over the past decade, significantly lower than the alpha = 0.05 usually considered. This suggests a statistically significant change, indicating a possible increase in rural literacy.", "normalised": "In a surprising turn of events, the Indian Institute of Statistical Analysis (I-I-S-A) declared a data anomaly in the recently concluded national census.
