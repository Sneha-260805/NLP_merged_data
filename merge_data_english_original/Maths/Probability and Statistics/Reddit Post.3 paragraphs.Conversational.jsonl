{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, I'm prepping for my exams and probability and stats are giving me a proper headache. I just can't seem to wrap my head around some concepts. Like, what's the actual difference between a standard deviation of 2.5 and one of 7? I know the formulas and all, but understanding the *why* is killing me. Any insights or real-world examples would be super helpful! My exam is on 25/07, so any help before then would be greatly appreciated.", "normalised": "Hey guys, I'm prepping for my exams and probability and stats are giving me a proper headache.

The textbook just throws formulas at you, but it doesn't connect it to anything. Are there any good resources or YouTube channels that break this down in a simple, Indian context?
