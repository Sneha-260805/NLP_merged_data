It’s based on past performance, pitch conditions, and a whole bunch of other factors – all analyzed using statistics! They look at things like his average score in the last 10 matches, the number of sixes he's hit at the Wankhede Stadium, and even the weather forecast.

You can use probability to estimate that! You'd look at your past performance on practice papers, the difficulty level of the actual exam, and even how well you've been sleeping lately. It’s not a guarantee, of course, but it gives you a good idea of where you stand. Maybe you’re consistently scoring 85% on the sample papers. Is scoring 90+% probable? That requires careful analysis.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about something closer to home – board exams.

Scientists test the drug on a group of patients and compare the results to a control group. They use statistical methods to determine if the drug is actually effective, or if the observed results are just due to chance. For example, they might find that 75% of patients taking a new diabetes medication saw a significant improvement in their blood sugar levels. That 75% is based on statistical analysis. What if it was tested on only 4 patients? Would that number still be valid?", "normalised": "Let's talk about a more serious example: medicine.
