{"unnormalised": "So, let's say we're dealing with a standard deck of cards. What's the probability of drawing a King? Well, that's easy, right? There are 4 Kings in a 52-card deck, so the probability is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13, or roughly 7.69%.", "normalised": "So, let's say we're dealing with a standard deck of cards. What's the probability of drawing a King? Well, that's easy, right? There are four Kings in a fifty two-card deck, so the probability is four divided by fifty two, which simplifies to one divided by thirteen, or roughly seven point six nine percent."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let's say I draw a card and tell you it's a heart. What's the probability it's a King now? This is where I get a bit confused. There are 13 hearts in the deck, and only 1 King of hearts. So is the probability 1/13, or approximately 7.69%? Does it remain the same regardless of the type of card?", "normalised": "Now, let's say I draw a card and tell you it's a heart. What's the probability it's a King now?

{"unnormalised": "My textbook then goes on to describe the multiplication rule. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A). So I guess in this case, A is drawing a King, and B is drawing a Heart.

{"unnormalised": "Okay, so what about independence? Let’s say that there is a bag with 3 red and 5 blue balls. If I choose one ball, replace it, and then draw again, how can I determine independence? I think that is something like the colour of the 1st ball does not influence the 2nd ball, so the events are independent.", "normalised": "Okay, so what about independence?

{"unnormalised": "Then there are things like standard deviation, how do I manually calculate it, is it just the square root of the variance? Also, what are all of the different distribution types and when should I use them? For example, I understand that we use the normal distrbution when we deal with continuous data. What about discrete data and sampling distriutions?", "normalised": "Then there are things like standard deviation, how do I manually calculate it, is it just the square root of the variance?
