Think of tossing a coin. P(Heads) = 1/2. That's probability right there. Statistics builds on this, helping us make sense of loads of such events.

{"unnormalised": "Now, formulas like standard deviation (σ) and the normal distribution curve (bell curve) might seem scary. But they just describe how data is spread out. Imagine plotting the heights of all students in your class. You'd probably see most clustered around a certain height, with fewer very tall or short kids. The normal distribution helps us model that. Concepts like Bayes' Theorem – P(A|B) – are super useful in machine learning too. Even simple percentages can be powerful – if 75% of your sample group prefers brand A, it's a strong indicator!", "normalised": "Now, formulas like standard deviation parenthesis sigma parenthesis and the normal distribution curve parenthesis bell curve parenthesis might seem scary.

Track your spending for a month and calculate the mean, median, and mode. Play around with data in spreadsheets or using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Seeing how these concepts apply in practice makes all the difference. Good luck!", "normalised": "Don't get bogged down in the theory immediately. Start with real-world examples.
