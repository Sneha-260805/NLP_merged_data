{"unnormalised": "Probability and Statistics are used *everywhere*, even if you don't realize it! Take cricket, for example. The probability of India winning a match against Australia can be estimated based on past performance data – things like average scores, wicket rates, and even weather conditions. Statisticians use concepts like Bayes' Theorem to update these probabilities as the match progresses, considering factors like the current score and remaining overs. Similarly, in elections, pollsters use statistical sampling to predict the outcome. A sample size of, say, 2000 voters can give a surprisingly accurate picture of the overall electorate, with a margin of error of about +/- 2%.", "normalised": "Probability and Statistics are used everywhere, even if you do not realize it!

They might calculate the probability of a 30-year-old person dying within the next year to determine the premium for a life insurance policy. Stock market analysts use statistical models to predict future stock prices, analyzing trends like moving averages. For example, if a stock has been consistently increasing by 0.5% per day for the last 3 months, they might use regression analysis to estimate its future performance, although this is never a sure thing! Even your loan EMI calculations rely on statistical analysis of interest rates over time.", "normalised": "Then there is finance.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, consider quality control in manufacturing. A factory producing light bulbs might sample 100 bulbs out of every batch of 10,000 to check for defects. The number of defective bulbs in the sample is used to estimate the overall defect rate for the batch. If the defect rate exceeds a certain threshold, like 2%, the entire batch might be rejected. Statistical process control charts are used to monitor the manufacturing process and identify any trends that could lead to increased defect rates. This helps companies like Tata Steel or Mahindra maintain consistent product quality.", "normalised": "Finally, consider quality control in manufacturing. A factory producing light bulbs might sample one hundred bulbs out of every batch of ten thousand to check for defects. The number of defective bulbs in the sample is used to estimate the overall defect rate for the batch.
