While the mean is stated as 5.2, the standard deviation requires recalculation as it appears inaccurate at 1.8. Could the data set used to derive these values be shared, specifically the sample size which seems to be impacting the SE (Standard Error)? Moreover, is the presented confidence interval reflecting a 95% CI, and what statistical software e.g. SPSS or R version was used to generate these stats? Also the p value should be clearly stated.", "normalised": "Regarding the probability distribution, the calculation seems to be off.
