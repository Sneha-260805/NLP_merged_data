{"unnormalised": "So, I was helping my little sister, Aisha, with her Class 10 Maths homework, specifically a section on probability. She was totally stumped! The question involved a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, & 2 green balls. What's the probability of picking a red ball on the 1st try? Then, without replacement, what's the prob of picking a blue ball next? Simple enough for me, right? But Aisha was getting confused with the whole \"without replacement\" part.", "normalised": "So, I was helping my little sister, Aisha, with her Class ten Maths homework, specifically a section on probability.

{"unnormalised": "I explained it to her like this: initially, there are 10 balls total (5+3+2 = 10). So, P(red on 1st try) = 5/10. Now, *if* you actually picked a red ball, you don't put it back. So, only 9 balls left. If you want a blue ball next, P(blue on 2nd try, given red 1st) = 3/9. It's all about the *conditional* probability, you see. We even used some M&Ms to simulate it – much tastier than textbook problems!", "normalised": "I explained it to her like this: initially, there are ten balls total (five plus three plus two equals ten).

{"unnormalised": "She still struggled a bit visualizing it, so I drew a probability tree diagram. It helped her see all the possible outcomes and their probabilities. I also tried to explain how Statistics is also used daily by companies to predict sales, especially during Diwali sales. She finally got it, and now she can solve similar questions without a problem! I felt like a proud bhai!", "normalised": "She still struggled a bit visualizing it, so I drew a probability tree diagram. It helped her see all the possible outcomes and their probabilities.
