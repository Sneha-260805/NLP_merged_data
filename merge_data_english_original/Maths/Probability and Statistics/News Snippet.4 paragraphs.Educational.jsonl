{"unnormalised": "A recent study by the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, has revealed interesting insights into the understanding of probability and statistics among Indian students. The study, conducted across 5 states with a sample size of 5000 students aged 16-18, found that only 35% of students could correctly answer questions involving conditional probability. This highlights a significant gap in the comprehension of fundamental statistical concepts.", "normalised": "A recent study by the I-S-I, Kolkata, has revealed interesting insights into the understanding of probability and statistics among Indian students. The study, conducted across five states with a sample size of five thousand students aged sixteen to eighteen, found that only thirty five percent of students could correctly answer questions involving conditional probability. This highlights a significant gap in the comprehension of fundamental statistical concepts."}
{"unnormalised": "The researchers analyzed student performance on topics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. Surprisingly, while 60% were able to calculate the mean of a given dataset, less than 20% understood the significance of standard deviation in measuring data dispersion. Moreover, complex problems such as finding the probability of drawing 2 red balls from a bag containing 5 red & 3 blue balls proved challenging for most, with an average success rate of only 0.25.", "normalised": "The researchers analyzed student performance on topics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

{"unnormalised": "Experts suggest that the current curriculum may need revision to emphasize practical applications of these concepts. Dr. Meena Sharma, a leading statistician, suggests integrating real-world examples such as analyzing cricket scores or predicting election outcomes to make learning more engaging. “Understanding concepts like p-value is crucial in today's data-driven world,” she stated, referring to its relevance in research and decision-making.", "normalised": "Experts suggest that the current curriculum may need revision to emphasize practical applications of these concepts.

{"unnormalised": "The findings of the ISI study underscore the need for improved teaching methods and a greater focus on statistical literacy in the Indian education system. With the increasing importance of data analytics across various industries, enhancing students’ grasp of probability and statistics is crucial for their future success. Initiatives like online courses and workshops could help bridge the existing knowledge gap, potentially increasing the national average on such tests to 70% within 5 years, according to projections.", "normalised": "The findings of the I-S-I study underscore the need for improved teaching methods and a greater focus on statistical literacy in the Indian education system.
