{"unnormalised": "A recent report by the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Kolkata indicates a significant shift in the understanding of probability and statistics among high school students. According to the survey, conducted across 2500 schools in India, the average score in the national statistics exam has increased by 12% compared to last year. The exam, graded out of 100, revealed an average score of 68.5 this year, compared to 56.5 in the previous assessment cycle.", "normalised": "A recent report by the Indian Statistical Institute (I-S-I) in Kolkata indicates a significant shift in the understanding of probability and statistics among high school students. According to the survey, conducted across two thousand five hundred schools in India, the average score in the national statistics exam has increased by twelve percent compared to last year. The exam, graded out of one hundred, revealed an average score of sixty eight point five this year, compared to fifty six point five in the previous assessment cycle."}
{"unnormalised": "The study attributes this improvement to the introduction of advanced statistical modeling techniques and more practical applications in the curriculum. For example, students are now using software packages like R and Python to analyze real-world datasets, such as the impact of monsoon rainfall on agricultural yield in Maharashtra, a dataset of approximately 20MB in size. The shift towards practical learning, as opposed to rote memorization of theorems, appears to be yielding positive outcomes.", "normalised": "The study attributes this improvement to the introduction of advanced statistical modeling techniques and more practical applications in the curriculum.

{"unnormalised": "However, the report also highlights disparities across different regions. States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu recorded average scores above 75, while states in the Northeast, particularly Assam and Meghalaya, lagged behind with averages around 50. These differences are attributed to variations in infrastructure and access to resources, including qualified teachers and advanced computational facilities. The ratio of teachers to students also varies considerably in some areas.", "normalised": "However, the report also highlights disparities across different regions.

This gap is linked to better access to coaching centers and online resources, as well as a higher level of parental involvement in education. The percentage of students opting for statistics-related fields in higher education has risen to approx. 8%.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the study found that students from urban areas outperformed their rural counterparts by approximately fifteen percent.
