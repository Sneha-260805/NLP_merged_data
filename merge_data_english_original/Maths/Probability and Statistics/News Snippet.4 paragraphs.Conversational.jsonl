{"unnormalised": "What's even cooler is the way they’re using probability and stats in real-world applications, like predicting exam results using past performance data. They're using something called Bayesian inference to estimate the likelihood of a student passing with a certain score. Pretty impressive, right? This could really help teachers identify students who might need a little extra support before the big day.", "normalised": "What's even cooler is the way they're using probability and statistics in real-world applications, like predicting exam results using past performance data.
