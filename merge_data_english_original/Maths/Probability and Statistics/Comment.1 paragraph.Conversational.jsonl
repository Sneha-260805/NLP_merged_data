{"unnormalised": "Arre yaar, that probability sum was so confusing! I spent like 30 mins on just 1 question. The teacher said something about standard deviation being 2.5, and the mean was 50. I think they wanted us to find the probability of something being between 47.5 and 52.5 using the Z-score. I still don't get how to use that Z table properly! Maybe I should just mug up the formulas... or ask Sharmaji's kid, he scored 98/100 on the last test!", "normalised": "Oh friend, that probability sum was so confusing! I spent like thirty minutes on just one question. The teacher said something about standard deviation being two point five, and the mean was fifty. I think they wanted us to find the probability of something being between forty seven point five and fifty two point five using the Z-score. I still don't get how to use that Z table properly! Maybe I should just mug up the formulas... or ask Sharmaji's kid, he scored ninety eight divided by one hundred on the last test!"}
