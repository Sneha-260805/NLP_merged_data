{"unnormalised": "Recent analysis from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata reveals a worrying trend in class 10 results across West Bengal. It seems the average score in Maths for students from rural schools has seen a dip of approximately 7% compared to last year’s data. The ISI, using data from over 500 schools, calculated the mean score and standard deviation to arrive at their conclusions.", "normalised": "Recent analysis from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata reveals a worrying trend in class ten results across West Bengal. It seems the average score in Maths for students from rural schools has seen a dip of approximately seven percent compared to last year’s data.

{"unnormalised": "The study attributes this decline to various factors, including disruptions in online learning during the pandemic and unequal access to resources. They also observed that only about 35% of rural students had access to reliable internet compared to 85% in urban areas. This inequality contributed significantly to the learning gap. Moreover, the study also highlighted that the probability of a student scoring above 80 marks was significantly lower in rural areas, standing at a mere 0.15 compared to 0.4 in urban schools.", "normalised": "The study attributes this decline to various factors, including disruptions in online learning during the pandemic and unequal access to resources. They also observed that only about thirty five percent of rural students had access to reliable internet compared to eighty five percent in urban areas. This inequality contributed significantly to the learning gap. Moreover, the study also highlighted that the probability of a student scoring above eighty marks was significantly lower in rural areas, standing at a mere zero point one five compared to zero point four in urban schools."}
{"unnormalised": "Interestingly, the variance in scores was also higher among rural students, indicating a wider disparity in academic performance. The study further noted a correlation between household income and Maths scores. Families earning less than Rs. 10,000 per month showed a lower average score by almost 12 marks. This brings up important questions regarding socioeconomic factors influencing academic outcomes.", "normalised": "Interestingly, the variance in scores was also higher among rural students, indicating a wider disparity in academic performance.

They propose remedial classes, improved teacher training, and providing digital access to students in need.
