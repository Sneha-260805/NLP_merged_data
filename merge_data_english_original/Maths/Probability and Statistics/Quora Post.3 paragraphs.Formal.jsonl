Let's take the example of predicting election outcomes, most news channels use probability models. Exit polls are essentially using a sample to infer the views of the entire electorate. For instance, a model might predict that BJP has a 65% chance of winning at least 272 seats. That “65%” is probability at work! This involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and a whole lot of other statistical techniques.", "normalised": "someone asked me about the applications of probability and statistics. well, let me tell you, they are everywhere! seriously. think about it. let us take the example of predicting election outcomes, most news channels use probability models. exit polls are essentially using a sample to infer the views of the entire electorate. for instance, a model might predict that B-J-P has a sixty five percent chance of winning at least two hundred and seventy two seats. that \"sixty five percent\" is probability at work! this involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and a whole lot of other statistical techniques."}

If they find that 3% of their steel bars are deviating from the desired tensile strength range or the mean length is off by 0.5 cm, they can quickly identify and fix the problem. This saves them money and ensures that the end product meets required standards. The Six Sigma methodology, widely used in industries, heavily relies on statistical analysis to reduce process variation to 3.4 defects per million opportunities.", "normalised": "or consider quality control in manufacturing. companies like Tata Steel use statistical process control (S-P-C) charts to monitor production. if they find that three percent of their steel bars are deviating from the desired tensile strength range or the mean length is off by zero point five centimeter, they can quickly identify and fix the problem. this saves them money and ensures that the end product meets required standards. the six sigma methodology, widely used in industries, heavily relies on statistical analysis to reduce process variation to three point four defects per million opportunities."}

In cricket, analysts use various statistical models like Win Probability to assess a team’s chance of winning at different stages of a match. So, next time you are watching an IPL game, and see a probability figure next to a team's name, remember, you're seeing applied statistics!
