{"unnormalised": "Okay guys, I need some serious help with probability. My stats professor, Dr. Sharma, gave us this assignment and I'm legit pulling my hair out. The question involves calculating the probability of, like, winning the lottery twice in a row! He even said it's less likely than finding an honest auto-rickshaw wala who actually uses the meter. The sample space is huge, maybe 1 in 300 million for a single win, and I'm supposed to figure out the odds of pulling that off *twice*. Seriously? My brain is melting faster than ice cream in Delhi in May.", "normalised": "Okay guys, I need some serious help with probability.

{"unnormalised": "I tried using Bayes' theorem, but I think I messed up the conditional probability part. The professor mentioned something about independent events, but honestly, after the first 5 minutes of the lecture, it all became a blur of Greek symbols and numbers. My friend, Rajesh, suggested using combinatorics, but that just confused me even more. He's probably just messing with me 'cause he knows I struggle with math. Any advice from you awesome Redditors? Plz help, my GPA is on the line!", "normalised": "I tried using Bayes' theorem, but I think I messed up the conditional probability part.

I'm starting to think the probability of me understanding this assignment is lower than the probability of finding a decent plate of momos for Rs. 50 in Mumbai.
