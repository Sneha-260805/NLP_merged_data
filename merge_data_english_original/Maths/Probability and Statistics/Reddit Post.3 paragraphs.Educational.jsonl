{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, I'm struggling with some Probability and Statistics problems and was hoping someone could help explain a few concepts. Specifically, I'm trying to wrap my head around Bayes' Theorem. The textbook gives this formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), but I can't seem to apply it practically. For example, the question asks: If a diagnostic test has a 95% sensitivity (P(B|A) = 0.95) and 90% specificity, and the prevalence of the disease in the population is 1% (P(A) = 0.01), what is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease (P(A|B))? My solution is coming completely off.", "normalised": "Hey guys, I'm struggling with some Probability and Statistics problems and was hoping someone could help explain a few concepts.

{"unnormalised": "I'm also getting confused between combinations and permutations. If I have a group of 10 students (say, from IIT Delhi) and I want to choose a committee of 3, is that a combination or a permutation? And how would I calculate it? Is it 10C3 or 10P3? What's the fundamental difference I'm missing? The practice questions throw in similar confusing examples. Also, another thing that is confusing me is standard deviation. How can the standard deviation be 0?", "normalised": "I'm also getting confused between combinations and permutations.
