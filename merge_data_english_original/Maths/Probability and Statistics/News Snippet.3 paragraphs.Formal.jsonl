{"unnormalised": "A recent study conducted by IIT Delhi has revealed a concerning trend in the understanding of basic probability and statistics among undergraduate students. The study, which surveyed 1200 students across various engineering and science disciplines, indicated that only 45% demonstrated a solid grasp of concepts such as standard deviation, binomial distribution, and Bayes' theorem. The average score on a standardized test assessing these concepts was reported as 62/100, raising concerns about the preparedness of future professionals in data-driven fields.", "normalised": "A recent study conducted by I-I-T Delhi has revealed a concerning trend in the understanding of basic probability and statistics among undergraduate students. The study, which surveyed one thousand two hundred students across various engineering and science disciplines, indicated that only forty five percent demonstrated a solid grasp of concepts such as standard deviation, binomial distribution, and Bayes' theorem. The average score on a standardized test assessing these concepts was reported as sixty two divided by one hundred, raising concerns about the preparedness of future professionals in data-driven fields."}
{"unnormalised": "The research highlights specific areas of weakness. For instance, the probability of an event, frequently denoted as P(A), was often misinterpreted, with students struggling to differentiate between independent and dependent events. Moreover, only 30% of participants could accurately calculate the confidence interval for a given dataset. The study authors emphasize the need for revised curricula and pedagogical approaches that incorporate real-world examples and interactive learning tools. These must allow them to grasp, for example, that a 1 in 6 chance (written sometimes as 1:6) is the likelyhood of a dice rolling a specific number.", "normalised": "The research highlights specific areas of weakness.
