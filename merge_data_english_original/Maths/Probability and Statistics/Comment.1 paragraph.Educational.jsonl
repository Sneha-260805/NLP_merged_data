{"unnormalised": "Regarding your doubt about probability, remember that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). If A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Also, for binomial distribution, the variance is npq, where 'n' is no. of trials, 'p' is probability of success and 'q' = 1-p. So if n= 100, p=0.6, and q=0.4, variance = 100 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 24. Don't forget to use the z-table for normal distributions; a z-score of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence interval.", "normalised": "Regarding your doubt about probability, remember that P of A or B equals P of A plus P of B minus P of A and B. If A and B are independent, then P of A and B equals P of A multiplied by P of B. Also, for binomial distribution, the variance is n p q, where 'n' is number of trials, 'p' is probability of success and 'q' equals one minus p. So if n equals one hundred, p equals zero point six, and q equals zero point four, variance equals one hundred multiplied by zero point six multiplied by zero point four equals twenty four. Don't forget to use the z-table for normal distributions; a z-score of one point nine six corresponds to a ninety five percent confidence interval."}
