It'll definitely make your work look super polished. Imagine, all those equations perfectly typeset! For example, the quadratic formula will look like this: `x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}`.

But if you see it as a long-term skill that could be useful for future projects or research, then definitely give it a shot! You can even try including some complex expressions and equations, like integral from zero to infinity of e to the power of negative x squared d x equals the square root of pi divided by two. Just make sure you can actually explain the Maths behind it!"}
