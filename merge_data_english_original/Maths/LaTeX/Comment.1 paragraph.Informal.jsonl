{"unnormalised": "Yeah, I'm struggling with that LaTeX equation too! The one that's like `\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}` gives me nightmares. Is `\\begin{equation}` the correct way to display it, or should I use `$$`? Also, does anyone know a good online LaTeX editor that supports all those symbols without throwing errors? I spent like 2 hrs last night just trying to get the sigma symbol right - both `\\sigma` and `\\varsigma` seemed off!", "normalised": "yeah, I'm struggling with that L-A-T-E-X equation too!
