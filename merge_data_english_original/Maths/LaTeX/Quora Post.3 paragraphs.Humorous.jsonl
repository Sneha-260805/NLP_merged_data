{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone just asked me about using LaTeX for math equations in Quora. Bhai, let me tell you, it's like trying to assemble IKEA furniture after downing 2 cups of chai – looks simple at first, but…well, you know. You start with these backslashes and curly braces, thinking, \"Aha! I'm a coding wizard!\" Then you end up with a jumbled mess of symbols that resemble ancient hieroglyphics more than anything a Class 10 student would recognize. Don't even get me started on matrices – those things are the bane of my existence. I swear, I once spent 3 hrs trying to get a 3x3 matrix to align properly. My neighbours probably thought I was performing some sort of mathematical exorcism!", "normalised": "Okay, so someone just asked me about using L-A-Tex for math equations in Quora.

{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, once you get the hang of it, LaTeX *is* pretty powerful. You can write equations like `$\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$` and get a beautiful derivative. Think of it as the saree of the math world – elegant, but takes a bit of practice to drape properly. And honestly, who doesn’t want their formulas looking like they came straight out of a textbook? So, keep at it, practice those backslashes, and remember, even Ramanujan probably struggled with his first LaTeX document.", "normalised": "Seriously though, once you get the hang of it, L-A-Tex is pretty powerful.

Nobody wants to see a bunch of dollar signs and unexplained symbols when they're just trying to figure out how to solve a quadratic equation.
