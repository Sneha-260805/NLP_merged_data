{"unnormalised": "For those struggling with the area of a circle in LaTeX, remember the formula is \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).

To approximate using the value of \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\), the area is roughly \\(78.54 \\text{ cm}^2\\). You can define your own command too! For example, use `\\newcommand{\\circleArea}[1]{\\pi * (#1)^2}` so that `\\circleArea{5}` gives you the answer in terms of pi. Remember to use the correct units (e.g., cm, m, mm).", "normalised": "For those struggling with the area of a circle in L-A-T-E-X, remember the formula is A equals pi r squared. If the radius, r, is given as five centimeter, then A equals pi five centimeter squared equals twenty five pi centimeter squared. To approximate using the value of pi approximately three point one four one five nine, the area is roughly seventy eight point five four centimeter squared. You can define your own command too! For example, use backslash newcommand backslash circle Area square bracket one curly bracket backslash pi asterisk hash one squared curly bracket so that backslash circle Area five gives you the answer in terms of pi.
