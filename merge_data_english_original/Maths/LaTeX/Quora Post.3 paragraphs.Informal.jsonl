{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone was asking about using LaTeX for maths on Quora, right? It's pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Like, to write a fraction you’d use `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}`. So, to display one-half, you'd type `\\frac{1}{2}`. Simple enough, no? But things can get complicated real fast, especially when you are dealing with integrals. For example, to display ∫ from 0 to ∞ of x^2 dx, one would use `\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 dx`. It looks intimidating at first, but honestly, it becomes second nature after you've done it a few times.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone was asking about using L-A-T-e-X for maths on Quora, right? It's pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Like, to write a fraction you would use backslash frac numerator denominator. So, to display one divided by two, you'd type backslash frac one two. Simple enough, no? But things can get complicated real fast, especially when you are dealing with integrals. For example, to display integral from zero to infinity of x squared d x, one would use backslash int sub zero super infinity x squared d x.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on matrices. That requires a whole different level of trickery! To define a matrix, you need to use environments like `pmatrix`, `bmatrix`, etc., along with `\\\\` for new rows and `&` to separate elements. A 2x2 matrix, like [[1, 2], [3, 4]] would translate to: `\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}`. Took me hours to figure that out the 1st time around! The AMS math package is really helpful for all this -- makes a HUGE difference.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on matrices. That requires a whole different level of trickery!

{"unnormalised": "Anyways, there are tons of tutorials online. Just google \"LaTeX maths tutorial\" and you'll find loads of stuff. It might seem like a pain initially, but trust me, for anything remotely mathematical, especially if you're planning to share it anywhere online (like, y'know, Quora), LaTeX is totally worth the effort. Good luck, and happy LaTeXing!", "normalised": "Anyways, there are tons of tutorials online. Just google L-A-T-e-X maths tutorial and you'll find loads of stuff.
