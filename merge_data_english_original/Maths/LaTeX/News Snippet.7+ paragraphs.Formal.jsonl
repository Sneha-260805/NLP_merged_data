{"unnormalised": "The surge in LaTeX adoption is attributed to several factors, incl. its ability to handle complex mathematical notations and equations with precision. For example, the equation for calculating the standard deviation, often represented as $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu)^2}$, is easily and clearly rendered using LaTeX. This is particularly valuable for students in STEM fields at institutions like IIT Delhi and IISc Bangalore.", "normalised": "The surge in L-a-T-e-X adoption is attributed to several factors, including its ability to handle complex mathematical notations and equations with precision.

Several universities are offering introductory workshops on LaTeX, and online resources such as tutorials and templates are becoming increasingly available. The cost of using LaTeX is virtually nil, as the software itself is free, eliminating barrier of cost.
