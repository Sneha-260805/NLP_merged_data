{"unnormalised": "Yeah, LaTeX can be a bit of a pain initially, but once you get the hang of it, it's super useful. I was struggling with writing equations like `x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}` for my engineering assignments. My prof suggested using an online editor which really helped. Now, I can easily type up complicated stuff like `\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}` without much hassle. Took me about 2 weeks of consistent use to feel comfortable, so hang in there!", "normalised": "Yeah, L-A-T-E-X can be a bit of a pain initially, but once you get the hang of it, it is super useful.
