Some students argue that it might discourage a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. But Prof. Gupta rebutted this by saying NumLaTeX is intended as a tool for efficiency, not a replacement for core maths skills. He added that \"understanding the theory is always paramount, this simply helps with the practical application.\"", "normalised": "Now, there’s been some chatter online about whether this relies too heavily on pre-existing algorithms.
