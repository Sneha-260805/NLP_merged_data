{"unnormalised": "A recent update to MathJax, a popular JavaScript display engine, promises to make viewing LaTeX-formatted content on web pages a whole lot easier. Specifically, the update targets rendering speed and compatibility across various browsers and devices. Imagine trying to read a paper where an equation like $E=mc^2$ takes forever to load. Frustrating, right? MathJax aims to fix that by implementing better caching mechanisms and optimizing code for different platforms.", "normalised": "A recent update to MathJax, a popular JavaScript display engine, promises to make viewing L-A-Tex formatted content on web pages a whole lot easier.

{"unnormalised": "The upgrade claims a speed improvement of up to 30% for complex equations. While 30% might sound small, it can make a HUGE difference, especially when dealing with research papers filled with integrals, summations, and matrices. Think of expressions like $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$ or $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2$ loading almost instantly. The project also boasts enhanced support for AMSmath packages, crucial for advanced mathematical notations.", "normalised": "The upgrade claims a speed improvement of up to thirty percent for complex equations.
