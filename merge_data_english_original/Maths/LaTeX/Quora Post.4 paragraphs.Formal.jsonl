{"unnormalised": "LaTeX can be quite frustrating when you're starting out, especially with the error messages. For instance, a very common error is forgetting to close a curly brace { or }, leading to an \"unclosed group\" error. This often happens in mathematical formulas. Another error arises from using the dollar sign $ incorrectly, especially within environments like `equation` or `align`. Make sure each $ has a corresponding closing $.", "normalised": "L-A-T-E-X can be quite frustrating when you are starting out, especially with the error messages.

{"unnormalised": "One frequent issue in mathematical equations is the misuse of commands. For example, writing `\\frac{1}{2x}` might result in a visually suboptimal output. Using parentheses around the denominator, i.e., `\\frac{1}{(2x)}`, or using `\\frac{1}{2}x` if that's the intention, is crucial. Moreover, trying to use mathematical notation outside of math mode (delimited by $...$, $$...$$, `\\(...\\)`, `\\[...\\]`, or environments like `equation`) will also throw errors. Ensure you're always within a math environment when writing equations like Σ(i=1 to n) i^2. Also, be mindful of special characters like &, %, #, $, _, {, }, ~ and ^. These have special meanings in LaTeX and need to be escaped using a backslash (e.g., \\$ for a dollar sign).", "normalised": "One frequent issue in mathematical equations is the misuse of commands.

{"unnormalised": "Packages can be a source of problems too. If you see \"undefined control sequence,\" it might mean you're using a command from a package you haven't included. Use `\\usepackage{packagename}` in your preamble. Sometimes, conflicting packages also cause errors. Furthermore, make sure your TeX distribution is up to date to ensure you have the latest versions of packages. Many errors show as \"! Missing $ inserted\" or \"! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \\cr.\" These can often be traced back to forgotten $ signs, curly brackets {}, or the position of the & character in tabular or align environments.", "normalised": "Packages can be a source of problems too.
