{"unnormalised": "A new initiative aims to introduce LaTeX to students in rural India, starting with pilot programs in schools across Uttar Pradesh. The program, slated to begin on 10/10/2024, focuses on simplifying complex mathematical equations and scientific notations, making them more accessible. Participants will learn to represent equations like $\\frac{d}{dx} e^{ax} = ae^{ax}$ or even more complex integrals such as $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ with greater clarity and precision.", "normalised": "A new initiative aims to introduce L-A-T-E-X to students in rural India, starting with pilot programs in schools across Uttar Pradesh.

{"unnormalised": "The initiative will also address challenges such as limited internet access by providing offline resources, including comprehensive manuals. These materials cover from basic operations up to generating graphs for data of various forms. The program’s success will be measured through post-workshop assessments, where students will be required to typeset various mathematical problems, including solving quadratic equations, showing the Pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 and manipulating trigonometric identities.", "normalised": "The initiative will also address challenges such as limited internet access by providing offline resources, including comprehensive manuals.
