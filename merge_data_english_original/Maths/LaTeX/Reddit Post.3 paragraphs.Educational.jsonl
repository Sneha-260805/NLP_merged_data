{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I'm a bit confused about using LaTeX for writing equations in my assignments. My prof said we need to use it for the final report, but I'm finding it hard. Can anyone recommend some good resources for beginners? Specifically, I'm struggling with things like writing fractions (e.g., \\frac{1}{2}) and exponents (e.g., x^2). Also, how do you write equations like Einstein's E=mc^2? Is there a simple way to learn these basic commands?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I'm a bit confused about using L-A-T-E-X for writing equations in my assignments.

{"unnormalised": "I tried looking online, but there's so much information that it's overwhelming. I saw something about using a package called 'amsmath' for more complex equations, but I'm not even sure what a package is or how to install it. If anyone has a good tutorial or cheat sheet for commonly used symbols and commands, especially for representing things like integrals (∫) and summations (∑), that would be super helpful.
