{"unnormalised": "Solving differential equations often requires precise notation, which is where LaTeX comes in handy. For example, expressing a second-order derivative can be done as `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}` in LaTeX. Let's say you're trying to solve `\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = e^{-x}`. First, find the integrating factor (IF). The IF is calculated as `e^{\\int P dx}`, where P is the coefficient of y. Here, `P = 2`, so the integrating factor would be `e^{\\int 2 dx} = e^{2x}`. Remember to use the correct symbols like `\\int` for integration and `e` for the exponential function.", "normalised": "Solving differential equations often requires precise notation, which is where L-A-T-E-X comes in handy.

{"unnormalised": "Next, multiply the entire equation by the integrating factor. This gives you `e^{2x} \\frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x}y = e^{x}`. The left side of this equation can now be written as the derivative of a product: `\\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{2x}) = e^{x}`. To isolate 'y', you need to integrate both sides with respect to 'x'. Therefore, `\\int \\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{2x}) dx = \\int e^{x} dx`. Using LaTeX, the integral becomes `ye^{2x} = e^{x} + C`, where C is the constant of integration.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, solve for 'y' by dividing both sides by `e^{2x}`. This results in the general solution: `y = e^{-x} + Ce^{-2x}`. Remember, this is a general solution; if you have initial conditions (e.g., `y(0) = 1`), you can substitute them into the equation to find the value of C and obtain a particular solution. Representing these conditions and the subsequent substitution in LaTeX will maintain clarity and readability, avoiding any ambiguity in mathematical notation. Good luck applying LaTeX to your mathematical problems!", "normalised": "Finally, solve for 'y' by dividing both sides by `e^{two x}`.
