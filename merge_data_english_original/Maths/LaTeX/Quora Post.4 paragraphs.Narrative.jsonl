{"unnormalised": "Now, with online classes becoming more common, especially after 2020, LaTeX is actually quite useful. For example, imagine a student solving the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. They can show their steps using LaTeX like this: $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$. Much clearer than just scribbling it down.", "normalised": "Now, with online classes becoming more common, especially after two thousand and twenty, L-A-T-E-X is actually quite useful. For example, imagine a student solving the quadratic equation a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero. They can show their steps using L-A-T-E-X like this: x equals negative b plus or minus square root of b squared minus four a c all divided by two a. Much clearer than just scribbling it down."}

Displaying these elegantly becomes easy with commands like $$\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$$. Earlier he would struggle to write it by hand clearly. The professor even suggested using Overleaf for collaborative problem-solving, which is amazing.", "normalised": "I remember helping my younger cousin prepare for his I-I-T entrance exam.
