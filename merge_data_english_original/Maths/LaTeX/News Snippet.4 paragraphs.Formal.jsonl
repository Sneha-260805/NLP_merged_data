Advanced topics such as creating complex tables using the $tabular$ environment and formatting algorithms with the $algorithmic$ package will also be addressed. Furthermore, participants will learn to leverage packages like $tikz$ for generating publication-ready diagrams. The cost of the program is estimated to be Rs. 5000 per participant.", "normalised": "The program will cover foundational aspects, including the use of basic mathematical symbols (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma) and equation environments (e.g., equation, align).
