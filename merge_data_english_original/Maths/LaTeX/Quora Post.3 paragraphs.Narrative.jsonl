{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked me about using LaTeX for maths exams, especially after they saw me quickly typing away during our Applied Maths paper last week. Honestly, at first, I was a bit hesitant. Using something like `\\frac{a}{b}` instead of writing the fraction properly seemed like a hassle. Plus, I thought the invigilator, Mrs. Sharma, would think I was up to something!", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about using L-A-T-E-X for maths exams, especially after they saw me quickly typing away during our Applied Maths paper last week.

{"unnormalised": "But then I realized how much faster it was for complex equations. Remember that horrible differential equation question, where we had to use integration by parts like 5 times? Writing it out longhand would've taken forever! With LaTeX, I just needed the `\\int` and `\\partial` commands, and the whole thing looked super neat and legible. I even used `\\begin{bmatrix} ... \\end{bmatrix}` for the matrix question, which was way cleaner than drawing it by hand. Saved me at least 15 mins, I reckon.", "normalised": "But then I realized how much faster it was for complex equations.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there's a learning curve. You gotta know the basic commands (like `\\sum`, `\\lim`, `\\sqrt`, and `^` for exponents), and it takes some practice to get comfortable. But honestly, if you're doing any serious maths, especially at the higher secondary level or beyond, learning LaTeX is a game-changer. Just don't forget your notebook, in case the exam doesn’t allow you to use computer. Good luck!", "normalised": "Of course, there's a learning curve.
