{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked me about using LaTeX for Maths equations, especially for CBSE class 10. TBH, it seems daunting at first, but it’s totally worth it! You can write things like quadratic equations and complicated formulas in a really clear and professional way. Instead of trying to explain exponents with just plain text, you can do something like `x^2 + bx + c = 0`. Much better, right? Plus, if you’re aiming for higher classes, especially if you’re thinking of doing Maths in Class 11 and 12, knowing LaTeX is a huge plus.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked me about using L-A-T-E-X for Maths equations, especially for C-B-S-E class ten.

You could also use a local installation of TeXstudio. Just type in the equations using LaTeX syntax and it'll generate a beautiful output for you. Think of those complex trigonometry formulas you see in textbooks, like `sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1`. You can recreate those easily. Even complicated integration symbols (\\int) and fractions (\\frac{a}{b}) are possible.", "normalised": "The thing is, getting started might feel like climbing Mount Everest.

Start with basic things like exponents, subscripts (`a_i`), and fractions, and then slowly move on to more complicated symbols and structures. Practice is KEY. Try recreating some of the equations from your NCERT textbook, page 45 maybe? That’ll give you a good feel for it.", "normalised": "There's tons of resources online, like on StackExchange or even YouTube tutorials for specific L-A-T-E-X commands.

It’s used in academic papers, research documents, and basically anywhere where you need to write complex mathematical equations in a clear and unambiguous way. So give it a shot! It might seem hard initially, but you’ll be writing beautiful equations like `E=mc^2` in no time!
