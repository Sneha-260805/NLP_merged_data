{"unnormalised": "New tool aims to simplify LaTeX for Indian students. Researchers at IIT Delhi have unveiled a new interface designed to make LaTeX more accessible, especially for students facing computational challenges. The platform uses AI to translate complex mathematical equations into simpler formats, significantly reducing the learning curve. Beta testing showed a 60% reduction in error rates when compiling documents containing formulae like $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.", "normalised": "New tool aims to simplify L-a-T-e-X for Indian students. Researchers at I-I-T Delhi have unveiled a new interface designed to make L-a-T-e-X more accessible, especially for students facing computational challenges. The platform uses A-I to translate complex mathematical equations into simpler formats, significantly reducing the learning curve. Beta testing showed a sixty percent reduction in error rates when compiling documents containing formulae like the fraction negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c all over two a."}
{"unnormalised": "The project focuses on frequently used equations in science and engineering curricula, converting code into a more user-friendly visual representation. For instance, the summation notation $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2$ is displayed alongside an expanded form, allowing users to understand its practical implications more easily. Furthermore, the tool incorporates support for various Indian languages to boost understandability.", "normalised": "The project focuses on frequently used equations in science and engineering curricula, converting code into a more user-friendly visual representation.

There are also plans to create specialized versions for fields such as statistics, where formulae like $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$ can often be confusing to new learners. The team hopes this will foster greater engagement with STEM disciplines.", "normalised": "The long-term goal is to integrate this technology into online learning platforms across India.
