{"unnormalised": "The core of the advancement lies in a refined tree traversal method, optimizing the placement of mathematical symbols within the document. Standard LaTeX compilers, such as TeX Live 2023, often struggle with intricate expressions, leading to significant rendering delays, particularly in high-resolution outputs intended for journal publications or digital textbooks. For instance, an equation like ∫₀^∞ x²e^(-x²) dx = √(π)/4, which is fairly standard, can take considerable time to properly render with all its superscripts, subscripts, and integral symbols.", "normalised": "The core of the advancement lies in a refined tree traversal method, optimizing the placement of mathematical symbols within the document.

{"unnormalised": "The IISc team proposes a dynamic allocation strategy for computational resources, prioritizing the rendering of the most visually prominent elements first. This approach differs from the traditional top-down, left-to-right processing order employed by existing LaTeX engines. Initial benchmarks suggest that the improved efficiency is most pronounced with equations exceeding 100 symbols or involving extensive use of matrices. As an example, a large matrix like \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix} \\] benefits noticeably.", "normalised": "The I-I-S-C team proposes a dynamic allocation strategy for computational resources, prioritizing the rendering of the most visually prominent elements first.

Dr. Rajiv Kumar, a professor at IIT Delhi, noted in an email that, \"While the initial results are promising, the algorithm's scalability and robustness require further investigation. Factors such as the font size and the specific LaTeX packages utilized can significantly impact performance. More sophisticated examples such as those involving the Riemann Zeta Function ζ(s)=∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/n^s need to be tested\".", "normalised": "However, some experts remain cautious, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing across a diverse set of mathematical texts.
