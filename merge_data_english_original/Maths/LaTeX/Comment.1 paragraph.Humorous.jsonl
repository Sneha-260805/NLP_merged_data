I swear, something like `x^2 + y^2 = r^2` shouldn't take this much effort. Guess I’ll stick to using MS Word and call it a day. At least it doesn’t need a PhD in computer science to insert a ₹ symbol after 2+2=4. Maybe I’ll just use that calculator app on my phone for now!", "normalised": "Arre yaar, L-A-T-E-X gives me a headache!
