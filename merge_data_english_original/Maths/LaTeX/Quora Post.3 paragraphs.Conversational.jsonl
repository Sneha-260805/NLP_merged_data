{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about using LaTeX for solving quadratic equations, right? Honestly, it's a lifesaver! For example, to write the standard quadratic formula, you'd use something like `x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}`. Boom! Beautiful equation in seconds. No more struggling with weird fraction formatting in Word. Also, if you want to show all the steps of solving a quadratic equation, say x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, you can use the `align` environment to keep everything neat. For instance, \\begin{align*} x^2 + 5x + 6 &= 0 \\\\ (x + 2)(x + 3) &= 0 \\\\ x &= -2, -3 \\end{align*} This keeps everything aligned properly, which is super helpful when you're dealing with multi-step problems.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about using L-A-T-E-X for solving quadratic equations, right? Honestly, it's a lifesaver! For example, to write the standard quadratic formula, you'd use something like x equals fraction negative b plus or minus square root of b squared minus four a c all over two a. Boom! Beautiful equation in seconds. No more struggling with weird fraction formatting in Word. Also, if you want to show all the steps of solving a quadratic equation, say x squared plus five x plus six equals zero, you can use the align environment to keep everything neat. For instance, begin align x squared plus five x plus six equals zero backslash backslash open parenthesis x plus two close parenthesis open parenthesis x plus three close parenthesis equals zero backslash backslash x equals negative two, negative three end align. This keeps everything aligned properly, which is super helpful when you're dealing with multi-step problems."}
{"unnormalised": "One neat trick is using LaTeX to represent sets and intervals. For example, the solution set to the equation above, {-2, -3}, can be easily written as `\\{-2, -3\\}`. Want to represent the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) being greater than or equal to 0? No problem! You just type `b^2 - 4ac \\geq 0`. See? Simple and clear! Plus, you can easily include these snippets in larger documents or presentations. It makes everything look so much more professional. You know how some students get confused with the \\pm symbol for +/-? LaTeX handles that perfectly.", "normalised": "One neat trick is using L-A-T-E-X to represent sets and intervals.

{"unnormalised": "So, yeah, LaTeX is definitely worth learning if you're dealing with mathematical equations, even simple ones like quadratic equations. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever did without it. There are tons of online resources to help you get started, and the result is just so much cleaner and easier to read than trying to format equations in a regular text editor. Give it a shot! You won't regret it.", "normalised": "So, yeah, L-A-T-E-X is definitely worth learning if you're dealing with mathematical equations, even simple ones like quadratic equations.
