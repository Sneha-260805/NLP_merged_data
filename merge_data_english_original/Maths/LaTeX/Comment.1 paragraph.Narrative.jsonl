I spent hours just trying to get the fractions and subscripts right, and don't even get me started on matrices! One time, I forgot a single backslash, and the whole document wouldn't compile. My friend Rohan helped me out, showing how Overleaf made things slightly easier. Good times, but definitely a steep learning curve.", "normalised": "Oh man, L-A-T-E-X in college!
