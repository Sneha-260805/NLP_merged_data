{"unnormalised": "Is LaTeX really that important for engineering students in India?", "normalised": "Well, it really depends on what you plan on doing after your B-Tech, doesn't it? If you're going for higher studies, especially a Master's or P-h-D abroad or even at I-I-S-C or I-I-T, then one hundred percent yes! You'll be writing reports, theses, and papers that will need equations and formulas. Trying to do that in M-S Word... bhai, good luck! L-A-T-E-X lets you write equations like E equals m c squared or the quadratic formula as x equals open parenthesis negative b plus or minus square root of open parenthesis b squared minus four a c close parenthesis close parenthesis divided by two a very easily. Learn it early. Plus, a lot of professors expect submissions in properly formatted L-A-T-E-X now, even in India."}

If you're going for higher studies, especially a Master's or PhD abroad or even at IISc or IIT, then 100% yes! You'll be writing reports, theses, and papers that will need equations and formulas. Trying to do that in MS Word... bhai, good luck! LaTeX lets you write equations like E=mc^2 (yes, that's how it looks unnormalized) or the quadratic formula as x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a very easily. Learn it early. Plus, a lot of professors expect submissions in properly formatted LaTeX now, even in India.", "normalised": "Think about it this way: your seniors probably struggled manually formatting everything. Why repeat their mistakes? Spend a few hours learning the basics. Websites like Overleaf are great since you don't need to install anything locally. You can start with simple things like writing chemical equations like H two O or complex stuff used in signal processing, like integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of e to the power of negative pi x squared d x equals one. Even if you don't use it every day, knowing L-A-T-E-X will save you time and headaches down the line. Especially if you are planning to write that paper on material science or signal processing."}

For example, if you are applying to a research internship at D-R-D-O (Defence Research and Development Organisation) or I-S-R-O (Indian Space Research Organisation), a background in L-A-T-E-X shows that you're serious about technical writing and can handle complex mathematical expressions. Don't wait until the last minute. Start now. Even a little knowledge like knowing how to write basic vectors (e.g., using vector a for a vector) or matrices will be useful. It might seem like a hassle now, but future you will thank you for mastering it."}
