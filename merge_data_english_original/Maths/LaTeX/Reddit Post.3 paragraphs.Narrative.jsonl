{"unnormalised": "My friend, Rohan, he was a whiz with computers, of course. He told me about Overleaf and how it made LaTeX editing easier. Showed me how to do fractions like `\\frac{a}{b}` and matrices like `\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}`. Suddenly, things started to click. Instead of just memorizing formulas, I started understanding the underlying structure. Plus, my handwritten notes looked so much neater when I typed them up in LaTeX! Turns out, that crazy syntax wasn't so bad after all.", "normalised": "My friend, Rohan, he was a whiz with computers, of course. He told me about Overleaf and how it made La-Tech editing easier.
