For instance, expressing the quadratic formula using LaTeX involves commands like: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Participants will learn how to use these commands and other formatting tools to create professional-looking documents that meet the standards of leading academic journals and conferences. The workshops will cover topics ranging from basic LaTeX syntax to more advanced features such as creating tables, figures, and bibliographies. Special attention will be given to producing documents using the standard article class, with examples of common mathematical notation such as $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.", "normalised": "L-a-T-e-X is known for its ability to handle complex mathematical formulas and equations with ease.
