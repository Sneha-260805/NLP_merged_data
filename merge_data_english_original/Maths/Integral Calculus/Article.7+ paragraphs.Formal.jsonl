{"unnormalised": "The historical development of integral calculus can be traced back to the work of ancient mathematicians like Archimedes, who employed methods of exhaustion to calculate areas and volumes. However, it was Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century who independently developed the modern framework of integral calculus. Their contributions laid the foundation for a systematic and rigorous approach to integration, paving the way for its widespread application in diverse fields. Newton's work was more focused on physics problems, whereas Leibniz created the notation, such as the integral sign (∫), commonly used today.

{"unnormalised": "Definite integrals, denoted by ∫ab f(x) dx, represent the accumulated value of a function f(x) over a specified interval [a, b]. This concept finds applications in calculating areas, volumes, work done by a force, and various other quantities. For example, in physics, the definite integral of velocity with respect to time yields the displacement of an object. In economics, it can be used to determine the total revenue generated over a period. The value of ‘a’ and ‘b’ can be anything for example, from 1.0 to 2.75 units.

{"unnormalised": "Indefinite integrals, on the other hand, represent the family of functions whose derivative is equal to a given function. These are represented as ∫f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) and C is the constant of integration. The constant of integration arises because the derivative of a constant is always zero, meaning there are infinitely many antiderivatives that differ by a constant value. While definite integrals yield a numerical value, indefinite integrals result in a function, showcasing the broader scope of integration in problem-solving. For example, let us take f(x) = x^2. Then F(x) = (x^3)/3 + C.", "normalised": "Indefinite integrals, on the other hand, represent the family of functions whose derivative is equal to a given function.

{"unnormalised": "Various techniques exist for evaluating integrals, depending on the complexity of the integrand. Some common methods include substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric substitution, and partial fraction decomposition. Each technique relies on manipulating the integral into a more manageable form that can be readily evaluated using standard integration rules. Advanced techniques like contour integration and numerical integration methods are employed for more complex integrals that do not have elementary antiderivatives. For instance, you might substitute u = 2x+1, when the original function is in terms of ‘x’.", "normalised": "Various techniques exist for evaluating integrals, depending on the complexity of the integrand.
