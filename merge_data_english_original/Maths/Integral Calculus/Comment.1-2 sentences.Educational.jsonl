{"unnormalised": "To solve the integral ∫x^2 dx from 1 to 5, you need to find the antiderivative (x^3)/3 and then evaluate it at x = 5 and x = 1; the final answer will be (125/3) - (1/3) = 124/3. Remember the +C for indefinite integrals!", "normalised": "To solve the integral of x squared d x from one to five, you need to find the antiderivative x cubed divided by three and then evaluate it at x equals five and x equals one; the final answer will be one hundred and twenty five divided by three minus one divided by three equals one hundred and twenty four divided by three. Remember the plus C for indefinite integrals!"}
