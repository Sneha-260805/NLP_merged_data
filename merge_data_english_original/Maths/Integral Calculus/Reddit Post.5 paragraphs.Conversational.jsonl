{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, struggling a bit with integral calculus, specifically with definite integrals. Anyone else find it a bit of a headache? I've been trying to solve problems from my RD Sharma textbook (pg no. 345, Q no. 7), and I'm just not getting the hang of evaluating limits. Like, when you have something like ∫(from 0 to π/2) sin²(x) dx, I keep messing up the substitution. Is there some trick I'm missing?", "normalised": "Hey guys, struggling a bit with integral calculus, specifically with definite integrals. Anyone else find it a bit of a headache?

{"unnormalised": "My professor, Dr. Iyer, keeps saying \"practice makes perfect,\" but I feel like I'm just practicing the wrong methods. He mentioned using the Leibniz rule once but honestly, I was too busy trying to understand the basic concepts. I’m aiming to score above 90% in my upcoming exams, and this chapter seems super crucial. Anyone have any tips for remembering all the integration formulas?
