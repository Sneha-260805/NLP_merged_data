{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some help with integral calculus! I'm prepping for my engineering entrance exam and integrals are seriously giving me a hard time. Specifically, I'm stuck on this problem: ∫ from 0 to 1 of x^2 * sqrt(1-x^2) dx. I've tried u-substitution, but it's not working out. Any tips or tricks from the math gurus here? Maybe someone can explain it step-by-step like I'm 5? I need to solve like 100 more questions of this type to even stand a chance.", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some help with integral calculus!

{"unnormalised": "I think I'm messing up with the limits of integration, esp. when changing variables. Like, do I need to change the limits from 0 and 1 to new values based on the substitution? And what about trig substitution? I keep hearing about it, but I don't really understand when to use it. Is there some formula or rule I'm missing? Any good resources you guys recommend? My coaching class notes aren't really doing it for me. Maybe Khan Academy or something? My exam is on 25/05/2024 so I am running short of time.", "normalised": "I think I'm messing up with the limits of integration, especially when changing variables.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what's the deal with definite vs. indefinite integrals? Does the +C matter at all in these types of problems with the ∫ symbol and numbers on it? I scored only 65% in my last mock test, and I need at least 90% to get into IIT Delhi. Praying to Ganpati Bappa that someone can help me out! Thanks in advance, bhai log!", "normalised": "Also, what's the deal with definite versus indefinite integrals?
