{"unnormalised": "Let's say you have a function, f(x). Integrating it means finding another function, let's call it F(x), such that the derivative of F(x) is equal to f(x).

{"unnormalised": "Now, some integrals are pretty straightforward. The integral of x^n (where n isn't -1) is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. So, the integral of x^2 is (x^3)/3 + C. Easy peasy, right?

{"unnormalised": "To calculate a definite integral, you first find the indefinite integral, F(x). Then, you evaluate F(b) and F(a) and subtract them: F(b) - F(a).
