{"unnormalised": "So, I was doing some problems from RD Sharma and got completely bogged down in something like ∫ from 0 to ∞ of xe^(-x^2) dx. I know that I have to use limits to evaluate it, but the whole ∞ thing throws me off. My textbook explained it once but I'm still unsure how to solve these types of sums. Any tips or tricks to think about the limits for this type of question.

{"unnormalised": "First, remember that ∫ from a to ∞ of f(x) dx is defined as lim (t→∞) ∫ from a to t of f(x) dx. This means you replace the upper limit of integration (∞) with a variable 't' and then take the limit as 't' approaches infinity. This is how you handle the infinite bound mathematically, the infinity symbol cannot be directly treated as a value. So, you will need to evaluate the definite integral ∫ from a to t of f(x) dx first and then find the limit of this function as 't' approaches ∞.", "normalised": "First, remember that integral from a to infinity of f of x d x is defined as limit as t approaches infinity of integral from a to t of f of x d x.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's solve the integral, ∫ from 0 to t of xe^(-x^2) dx. The most straightforward way is to use u-substitution. Let u = -x^2. Then du/dx = -2x, which means du = -2x dx. Therefore, x dx = -1/2 du. Also, we're dealing with a definite integral here, so changing x to u means we need to change the integration limits as well. When x=0, u = -(0)^2 = 0 and when x=t, u = -(t)^2 = -t^2. So the transformed integral becomes: ∫ from 0 to -t^2 of -1/2 e^u du. Or, by switching the limits of integration and negating the integral, (1/2) ∫ from -t^2 to 0 of e^u du.", "normalised": "Now, let us solve the integral, integral from zero to t of x e to the power of negative x squared d x. The most straightforward way is to use u-substitution. Let u equals negative x squared. Then d u divided by d x equals negative two x, which means d u equals negative two x d x. Therefore, x d x equals negative one divided by two d u. Also, we are dealing with a definite integral here, so changing x to u means we need to change the integration limits as well. When x equals zero, u equals negative zero squared equals zero and when x equals t, u equals negative t squared. So the transformed integral becomes: integral from zero to negative t squared of negative one divided by two e to the power of u d u. Or, by switching the limits of integration and negating the integral, one divided by two integral from negative t squared to zero of e to the power of u d u."}
{"unnormalised": "The integral of e^u is simply e^u, so we have (1/2) [e^u] from -t^2 to 0 = (1/2) [e^(0) - e^(-t^2)] = (1/2) [1 - e^(-t^2)]. Now, we have to deal with that limit: lim (t→∞) (1/2) [1 - e^(-t^2)].", "normalised": "The integral of e to the power of u is simply e to the power of u, so we have one divided by two e to the power of u from negative t squared to zero equals one divided by two e to the power of zero minus e to the power of negative t squared equals one divided by two one minus e to the power of negative t squared. Now, we have to deal with that limit: limit as t approaches infinity of one divided by two one minus e to the power of negative t squared."}
{"unnormalised": "As t approaches infinity, t^2 also approaches infinity. So, e^(-t^2) = 1/e^(t^2) approaches 0. Therefore, the entire expression lim (t→∞) (1/2) [1 - e^(-t^2)] becomes (1/2) [1 - 0] = 1/2. That means the ∫ from 0 to ∞ of xe^(-x^2) dx = 1/2.", "normalised": "As t approaches infinity, t squared also approaches infinity. So, e to the power of negative t squared equals one divided by e to the power of t squared approaches zero. Therefore, the entire expression limit as t approaches infinity of one divided by two one minus e to the power of negative t squared becomes one divided by two one minus zero equals one divided by two. That means the integral from zero to infinity of x e to the power of negative x squared d x equals one divided by two."}
{"unnormalised": "Is there a way to solve this sum without u-substitution? Well, one might try looking at the derivative of e^(-x^2). After all, that is part of our integrand, and the only tricky part. But using the chain rule, the derivative is always equal to -2xe^(-x^2), so even if the antiderivative is known, you still have to do the u-substitution. This really does look like u-substitution is the only approach to the problem.", "normalised": "Is there a way to solve this sum without u-substitution?
