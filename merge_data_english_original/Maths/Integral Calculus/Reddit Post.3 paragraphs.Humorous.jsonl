Newton or Leibniz, I blame you both equally!

{"unnormalised": "Seriously, I thought I was doing okay until I hit definite integrals. Now I'm seeing limits from negative infinity to positive infinity… my mind just blanks out. My textbook, Thomas' Calculus (14th edition BTW), is now covered in coffee stains and tears. Is there some sort of magical shortcut I'm missing? Is there a guru who can just whisper the secrets of integration into my ear? Or maybe a chai that magically makes me understand the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?

Good luck surviving your exams folks! And BTW, what IS the integral of x^2? Seriously, I forgot. 😅", "normalised": "Anyone else feel like they are battling integrals on a daily basis?
