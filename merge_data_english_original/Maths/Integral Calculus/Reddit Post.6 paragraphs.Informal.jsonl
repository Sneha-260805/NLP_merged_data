{"unnormalised": "Like, I saw this example: ∫ from 0 to π/2 of sin(x) / (1 + cos(x)) dx. The prof did it in class, but honestly, I was too busy daydreaming about chai to actually follow the steps properly. I kinda get the u-substitution thing, but then I get lost with the limits. Changing from x limits to u limits just throws me off every time. Anyone got a foolproof method for keeping it straight?", "normalised": "Like, I saw this example: integral from zero to pi divided by two of sine of x divided by one plus cosine of x d x.

{"unnormalised": "And then there are those sneaky integrals with secant and tangent functions! I swear, they change the rules every time. One minute it's sec^2(x) turning into tan(x), the next I'm staring blankly at my paper. Any good resources or mnemonics for remembering those identities and their integrals? My textbook is basically useless.", "normalised": "And then there are those sneaky integrals with secant and tangent functions! I swear, they change the rules every time.

{"unnormalised": "Also, is there a quicker way to evaluate definite integrals numerically? Like, can I just plug it into Wolfram Alpha and call it a day on the exam? (Just kidding…mostly!).

{"unnormalised": "My current study method is just banging my head against the textbook (not recommended, btw). I've done like, 5 problems from my textbook and 2 practice papers. The practice papers are proving to be too hard for me. I'm using Arihant's JEE Main book and Cengage's Calculus book, should I buy a new one? I'm aiming for a score of 180+ in the exam.
