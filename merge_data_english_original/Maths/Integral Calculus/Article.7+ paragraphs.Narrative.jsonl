{"unnormalised": "I started by revisiting the basics: the fundamental theorem of calculus, indefinite integrals, and the power rule. Hours were spent in the central library, poring over textbooks and solving problems from past years’ question papers. Integration by parts felt like navigating a labyrinth, u-substitution a constant game of guess and check. My attempts to solve the integral of x^2 * sin(x) often ended in frustration.", "normalised": "I started by revisiting the basics: the fundamental theorem of calculus, indefinite integrals, and the power rule.

{"unnormalised": "One evening, while sipping chai at a stall near Ganga Dhaba, I overheard a conversation about using Python to solve complex integrals. That was a revelation! I immediately downloaded the SymPy library and started experimenting. It was astonishing to see how easily the software could compute integrals that took me hours to solve by hand. Suddenly, I could verify my solutions and quickly identify where I was going wrong. Even the dreaded integral of e^(-x^2) yielded to the power of computational methods.", "normalised": "One evening, while sipping chai at a stall near Ganga Dhaba, I overheard a conversation about using Python to solve complex integrals.

{"unnormalised": "The real turning point came when I started applying integral calculus to real-world problems. I calculated the area under a curve representing the velocity of an auto-rickshaw, determining the total distance travelled. I modelled population growth using exponential functions and integrated them to predict future population sizes, drawing data from the 2011 Census. Even the simple act of calculating the volume of a spherical water tank used integration. These applications brought the abstract concepts to life. My scores on practice exams steadily climbed to 80%, then 85%, and finally, consistently above 90.", "normalised": "The real turning point came when I started applying integral calculus to real-world problems.

{"unnormalised": "I recall one particularly challenging problem involving calculating the volume of a solid of revolution. The function defining the shape was complex, something like f(x) = sqrt(1 + cos(2x)). The textbook’s solution was terse and skipped several steps. I spent nearly 4 hrs wrestling with it, filling pages with calculations. Finally, after much trial and error, I arrived at the correct answer.
