{"unnormalised": "So, you've heard about integral calculus, right? Maybe you're staring at some equations wondering what's even going on. Don't worry, it's totally manageable! Think of it as the reverse of differentiation. Remember finding the slope of a curve? Well, integral calculus helps us find the area *under* that curve. Sounds useful, no? It actually is! We use it for tons of things, from figuring out how much water a tank can hold to calculating the trajectory of a rocket. Those integrals with the curvy \"S\" symbol? They're just area finders!", "normalised": "So, you have heard about integral calculus, right? Maybe you are staring at some equations wondering what is even going on.

{"unnormalised": "Let's break it down a bit. Imagine you have a function, say f(x) = x^2. The integral of that function, denoted as ∫x^2 dx, is basically finding another function whose derivative gives you x^2. It turns out that ∫x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C. The \"+ C\" is super important! It’s the constant of integration, because when you differentiate a constant, you get 0. So, there are actually infinitely many functions that differentiate to x^2, all differing by a constant. That \"C\" keeps things honest. Solving for \"C\" often requires knowing the value of the function at some point (initial conditions).", "normalised": "Let us break it down a bit. Imagine you have a function, say f of x equals x squared. The integral of that function, denoted as integral of x squared d x, is basically finding another function whose derivative gives you x squared.

{"unnormalised": "Now, there are different types of integrals. We have definite integrals and indefinite integrals. Indefinite integrals, like the one we just looked at, give you a general function plus the constant of integration. Definite integrals, on the other hand, have limits of integration, like ∫_a^b f(x) dx. These limits tell you the starting and ending points for calculating the area under the curve. So, the answer to a definite integral is a number, not a function! For instance, imagine we need to calculate the area under the curve x^2 between the limits of x=1 & x=3. We'd express it as: ∫_1^3 x^2 dx = [(3^3)/3 + C] - [(1^3)/3 + C] = 9 - (1/3) = 26/3.", "normalised": "Now, there are different types of integrals. We have definite integrals and indefinite integrals.

{"unnormalised": "There are a bunch of tricks to make integration easier. U-substitution is a big one! It helps you simplify complex integrals by substituting a part of the integrand with a new variable, \"u\". Then there's integration by parts, which is useful for integrals involving products of functions. Think of it like the product rule for differentiation, but in reverse! Mastering these techniques takes practice, but once you get the hang of them, you'll feel like a calculus superhero! Solving problems like ∫x*cos(x) dx becomes much easier using integration by parts.", "normalised": "There are a bunch of tricks to make integration easier. U-substitution is a big one!
