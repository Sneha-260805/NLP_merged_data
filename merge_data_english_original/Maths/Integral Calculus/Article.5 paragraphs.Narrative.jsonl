{"unnormalised": "My brain felt like it was running at 10% efficiency. We’d covered definite integrals in class, problems involving limits from say, 0 to π/2, but this…this was something else. The textbook had a section on double integrals, which seemed terrifyingly complex. I wished I had paid more attention in the earlier lectures. Perhaps I should have solved more than just the bare minimum of 5 problems per chapter! My future, and potentially my job at TCS, hinged on clearing this exam.", "normalised": "My brain felt like it was running at ten percent efficiency.

{"unnormalised": "Suddenly, a faint memory surfaced – a similar problem solved during a practice session. I scrambled through my notes, a chaotic mess of formulas and scribbled diagrams. Aha! There it was – the integral of x*e^x dx. Close enough! I remembered the formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Substituting, I managed to transform the troublesome integral into something manageable. After several attempts, filled with nervous energy and fuelled by countless cups of chai, I arrived at a solution.", "normalised": "Suddenly, a faint memory surfaced – a similar problem solved during a practice session.

{"unnormalised": "The answer staring back at me was: -x*cos(x) + sin(x) + C. It looked…right. Prof. Mathur often emphasized checking the answer by differentiating. Differentiating this, would I get back x*sin(x)? My heart pounded as I started the reverse calculation. After what seemed like an eternity, it clicked! The derivative perfectly matched the original integrand. A wave of relief washed over me.

But the victory over the integral of x*sin(x) dx had given me a much-needed boost.
