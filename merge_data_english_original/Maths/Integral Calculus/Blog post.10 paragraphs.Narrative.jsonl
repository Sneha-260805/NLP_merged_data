The teacher, Mrs. Sharma, always went on about antiderivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus.

{"unnormalised": "He explained that the integral, written as ∫f(x) dx from a to b, basically chopped up the area under the curve into infinitely thin rectangles. Each rectangle had a tiny width, dx, and a height determined by the function f(x). Adding up the areas of all those tiny rectangles gave you the total area under the curve *between* the points a and b.", "normalised": "He explained that the integral, written as integral of f of x d x from a to b, basically chopped up the area under the curve into infinitely thin rectangles.

Integrating that function over the entire monsoon season gives you the total rainfall in mm.\" He scrawled something that looked like ∫ rainfall(t) dt from june 1 to sept 30.", "normalised": "\"Think of it like this,\" he said, grabbing another napkin (much to my horror). \"Imagine you're calculating the total rainfall in Mumbai during the monsoon.

{"unnormalised": "Suddenly, it started to click. It wasn’t just about abstract functions anymore. It was about real-world stuff! Rohan then showed me how to calculate the area under a simple curve like f(x) = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 2. Turns out, it involves finding the antiderivative (which is x^3/3 in this case), plugging in the limits, and subtracting. The answer, 8/3, wasn't nearly as intimidating as the process seemed initially.", "normalised": "Suddenly, it started to click. It wasn’t just about abstract functions anymore.

{"unnormalised": "He then presented me with another challenge, finding the area under f(x) = sin(x) between 0 and π. This one required a little more thought, as the antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x).

{"unnormalised": "Now, I'm not saying I'm ready to tackle triple integrals or anything. But I've definitely developed a newfound appreciation for integral calculus. I even started seeing integrals in everyday life – the distance traveled by my auto-rickshaw as the integral of its speed over time, the total electricity consumption in my apartment as the integral of the power drawn over a month. Maybe Mrs. Sharma was right all along. Calculus *is* useful!
