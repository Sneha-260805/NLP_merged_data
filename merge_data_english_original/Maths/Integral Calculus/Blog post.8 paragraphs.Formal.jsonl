{"unnormalised": "At its heart, integral calculus addresses the problem of determining the area under a curve. Given a function f(x) defined over an interval [a, b], the definite integral, denoted as ∫ab f(x) dx, quantifies the net area enclosed by the curve, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = a and x = b. Understanding this geometric interpretation is crucial for grasping the essence of integration. The fundamental theorem of calculus provides the vital link between differentiation and integration. It states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), i.e., F'(x) = f(x), then ∫ab f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a). This theorem dramatically simplifies the computation of definite integrals, reducing it to the problem of finding antiderivatives.", "normalised": "At its heart, integral calculus addresses the problem of determining the area under a curve.

{"unnormalised": "Several techniques facilitate the evaluation of integrals. Substitution, often referred to as the u-substitution method, simplifies integrals by replacing a complex function with a simpler one. Integration by parts, based on the product rule of differentiation, proves invaluable for integrals involving products of functions. Trigonometric substitutions, like substituting x = a sin θ, are effective for integrals containing expressions of the form √(a² - x²), √(a² + x²), or √(x² - a²). For instance, the integral ∫√(4-x^2) dx can be solved effectively using the trig substitution technique.", "normalised": "Several techniques facilitate the evaluation of integrals.
