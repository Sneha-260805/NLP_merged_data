{"unnormalised": "At its heart, integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities. The definite integral, denoted by ∫abf(x) dx, represents the area under the curve of a function f(x) between the limits a and b. The antiderivative, also known as the indefinite integral, is the reverse process of differentiation. Finding the antiderivative of a function involves identifying a function whose derivative is equal to the given function. For example, the antiderivative of x2 is (1/3)x3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.", "normalised": "at its heart, integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities. the definite integral, denoted by integral from a to b of f of x d x, represents the area under the curve of a function f of x between the limits a and b. the antiderivative, also known as the indefinite integral, is the reverse process of differentiation. finding the antiderivative of a function involves identifying a function whose derivative is equal to the given function. for example, the antiderivative of x squared is one divided by three x cubed plus C, where C is the constant of integration."}
