{"unnormalised": "Integral calculus... sounds fancy, doesn't it? Like some ancient art known only to a select few math wizards. But honestly, at its core, it's just finding the area under a curve. Simple, right? WRONG. It's about as simple as untangling your earphones after they've been in your pocket for 5 minutes. Good luck with that.", "normalised": "Integral calculus... sounds fancy, doesn't it? Like some ancient art known only to a select few math wizards.

{"unnormalised": "You see, finding the area of a rectangle is a piece of cake (especially if it's a 10cm x 10cm piece of chocolate cake - yum!). But what if the shape is all curvy and unpredictable, like the traffic in Bangalore at 8:30 AM? That's where integrals come in. They chop up the area into infinitely small rectangles (think REALLY tiny), calculate the area of each, and then add them all up. It's like pixel art, but with math and existential dread.", "normalised": "You see, finding the area of a rectangle is a piece of cake (especially if it's a ten centimeter by ten centimeter piece of chocolate cake - yum!).

{"unnormalised": "Now, there are two main types of integrals: definite and indefinite. Definite integrals are like saying, \"Okay, I want the area under this curve between x = 1 and x = 5.\" You get a nice, neat number as your answer. Indefinite integrals are more like, \"Just give me the general idea of the area.\" You get a function as your answer, plus a mysterious \"+ C\" at the end, which is the \"constant of integration.\" Think of \"C\" as that extra pinch of *masala* in your *dal*; you don't always know exactly how much to add, but it's important! Some say it could be 0. Some say it could be 42. The possibilities are *literally* endless!", "normalised": "Now, there are two main types of integrals: definite and indefinite.

{"unnormalised": "Integration by parts, in particular, is a real head-scratcher. It's like trying to assemble an IKEA bookshelf without the instructions, using only a rusty screwdriver and a strong feeling of impending doom.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on improper integrals. These are integrals where either the limits of integration go to infinity (like trying to count all the stars in the sky) or the function blows up at some point (like that time you tried to deep-fry *gulab jamuns*). They're like the mathematical equivalent of trying to herd cats – unpredictable and prone to exploding at any moment.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on improper integrals.

{"unnormalised": "So, why do we even bother with integrals? Well, they're used in everything from physics and engineering to economics and computer science. They help us calculate areas, volumes, probabilities, and all sorts of other important stuff. Plus, knowing integrals makes you sound really smart at parties (although, fair warning, it might also make you the most unpopular person there).", "normalised": "So, why do we even bother with integrals?

{"unnormalised": "The best way to master integrals is, unfortunately, practice. Lots and lots of practice. Grab a textbook, find some online resources, and start grinding. And remember, even the greatest mathematicians struggled with integrals at some point. So, don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Just keep at it, and eventually, you'll start to see the area under the curve (and hopefully, the light at the end of the tunnel).", "normalised": "The best way to master integrals is, unfortunately, practice.
