Where differentiation is all about finding the *rate of change* of a function, integral calculus is about finding the *accumulation* of that function. Like figuring out the total distance you've traveled based on your speed at any given moment. Makes sense, no? We will work through some examples to make this more clear.", "normalised": "Okay, so you're diving into integral calculus? Don't worry, it's not as scary as it looks!

{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics. You've probably seen the ∫ symbol, right? That’s the integral sign. Now, ∫ f(x) dx basically means \"find the antiderivative of f(x) with respect to x\". The \"dx\" part tells you which variable you're integrating with respect to. It's like saying “integrate f(x) relative to x”. Remember that + C we add at the end of every integral? That accounts for the fact that when we take the derivative of a constant number, it equals zero. ", "normalised": "Let's start with the basics. You've probably seen the integral symbol, right?

{"unnormalised": "Let's try another example. Say you wanted to find the integral of f(x)= x^3 + 2x. The integral of x^3 = (x^4)/4, and the integral of 2x = x^2.
