{"unnormalised": "For example, a problem in my coaching class asked about the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2. The solution used a definite integral, ∫₀² x² dx.

Why does taking the integral of x^2 and plugging in 2 and 0 give me the area between the curve and the x-axis?", "normalised": "For example, a problem in my coaching class asked about the area under the curve y equals x squared from x equals zero to x equals two.
