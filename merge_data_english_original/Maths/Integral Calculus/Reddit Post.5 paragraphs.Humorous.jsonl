{"unnormalised": "My professor, Dr. Iyer (bless her soul, she really tries), explained it all so clearly on 05/03/2024. Said something about U-substitution and integration by parts. Integration by parts? More like integration BY PAINS, am I right? It’s like trying to untangle a saree after Diwali – just a giant mess. Then she throws in stuff like definite integrals with limits from 0 to π/2. Like, seriously? Can't we just stick to regular numbers? I got a 65% on the last test, and I’m convinced it’s all because of these integrals.", "normalised": "My professor, Doctor Iyer (bless her soul, she really tries), explained it all so clearly on fifth march two thousand and twenty four.
