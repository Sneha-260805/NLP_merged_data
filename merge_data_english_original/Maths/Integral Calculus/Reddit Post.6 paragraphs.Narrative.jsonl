{"unnormalised": "One evening, while sipping chai at a tapri near my house after a brutal 3 hr mock test (scored a measly 45/300, btw!), I started sketching the graphs for the integrands on my phone. Suddenly, the whole \"area under the curve\" thing made sense. The integrals weren't just some abstract mathematical operation anymore; they were actually representing something. It was like finding the area of an oddly shaped garden plot, say a 15 m by 20 m one.", "normalised": "One evening, while sipping chai at a tapri near my house after a brutal three hour mock test (scored a measly forty five divided by three hundred, by the way!), I started sketching the graphs for the integrands on my phone.
