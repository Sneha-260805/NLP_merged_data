{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! If you're just starting out with calculus, integral calculus can seem like a seriously daunting mountain to climb. But trust me, it's not as scary as it looks! Think of it as the inverse operation of differentiation – while differentiation helps you find the rate of change of a function, integration helps you find the area under a curve. This post aims to break down the basics in a way that's easy to understand, even if you're still grappling with the foundational concepts.", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "At its heart, integration revolves around finding the antiderivative. Say you have a function f(x) = x^2. Integration basically helps in finding a new function, F(x), whose derivative is equal to f(x). In our case, the integral of x^2 would be (x^3)/3 + C. See that \"+ C\"? That's the constant of integration, a really crucial part. Because the derivative of ANY constant is 0, we need to account for that unknown original constant!", "normalised": "At its heart, integration revolves around finding the antiderivative. Say you have a function f of x equals x squared. Integration basically helps in finding a new function, capital F of x, whose derivative is equal to f of x. In our case, the integral of x squared would be x cubed divided by three plus C. See that \"plus C\"? That is the constant of integration, a really crucial part.

Definite integrals, on the other hand, have limits of integration – 'a' and 'b' – and they give you a specific numerical value representing the area under the curve of the function between those limits. You'll often see it written like this: ∫[a to b] f(x) dx.", "normalised": "There are primarily two types of integrals: definite and indefinite.

{"unnormalised": "Let's look at a practical example. Imagine you want to calculate the area under the curve of f(x) = x between x = 1 and x = 3. The definite integral would be ∫[1 to 3] x dx. First, we find the antiderivative of x, which is (x^2)/2. Then, we evaluate this at the upper limit (3) and the lower limit (1), and subtract the second from the first. That is, [(3^2)/2] - [(1^2)/2] = [9/2] - [1/2] = 8/2 = 4. So, the area under the curve of f(x) = x from x = 1 to x = 3 is 4 square units. Remember to include the units.", "normalised": "Let us look at a practical example. Imagine you want to calculate the area under the curve of f of x equals x between x equals one and x equals three. The definite integral would be integral from one to three of x d x. First, we find the antiderivative of x, which is x squared divided by two. Then, we evaluate this at the upper limit (three) and the lower limit (one), and subtract the second from the first. That is, three squared divided by two minus one squared divided by two equals nine divided by two minus one divided by two equals eight divided by two equals four. So, the area under the curve of f of x equals x from x equals one to x equals three is four square units. Remember to include the units."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, for the exam! Expect to see a LOT of problems involving basic power rule integrals (∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1). Also, be prepared to tackle integrals of trigonometric functions (like sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), etc.), exponential functions (e.g., ∫e^x dx = e^x + C), and logarithmic functions. U-substitution and integration by parts are two powerful techniques for tackling more complex integrals. Master these and you'll be in good shape!", "normalised": "Now, for the exam!

{"unnormalised": "Real-world applications of integral calculus are vast. Consider physics, where integration is used to calculate work done by a force, the center of mass of an object, or the total electric charge in a region. In economics, it can be used to determine consumer surplus or producer surplus. Even in statistics, it's used extensively in probability distributions. My friend Sharma uncle, a civil engineer, uses these equations for almost 60% of his calculations!", "normalised": "Real-world applications of integral calculus are vast.
