Often perceived as the tougher sibling of Differential Calculus, it's actually a powerful tool with diverse applications. Let's prepone our understanding and dive right in, shall we?", "normalised": "First, let us understand the basic concept. Imagine you have a function, say, f of x equals x squared. Differential calculus tells you the slope of this function at any point, its derivative. Integral calculus, on the other hand, answers a different question: What is the area under this curve between two points, like x equals one and x equals three? This area is found using integration. This process of finding the area under a curve is the integral. The notation for the integral of f of x is written as integral of f of x d x."}

It essentially says that integration is the reverse operation of differentiation. If F of x is the integral of f of x, then d divided by d x of F of x equals f of x. Remember this relationship is key, like knowing two plus two equals four. Finding the integral F of x is called finding the antiderivative. Now, to find the exact area under f of x from a to b we do: F of b minus F of a, which is often written as integral from a to b of f of x d x."}

Well, many standard formulas exist. For example, the integral of x to the power of n, where n is not equal to negative one, is x to the power of n plus one divided by n plus one plus C, where C is the constant of integration. This constant is crucial because the derivative of a constant is zero, so we cannot know for sure what constant term was there when taking the derivative. For example, the integral of x cubed equals x to the power of four divided by four plus C. The integral of e to the power of x is simply e to the power of x plus C. Similarly, the integral of sine of x is negative cosine of x plus C, and the integral of cosine of x is sine of x plus C. Learning these rules is like memorizing the multiplication tables of the math world."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, how do we actually perform integration? Well, many standard formulas exist. For example, the integral of x^n (where n is not equal to -1) is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where 'C' is the constant of integration. This constant is crucial because the derivative of a constant is zero, so we can't know for sure what constant term was there when taking the derivative. For example, the integral of x^3 = (x^4)/4 + C. The integral of e^x is simply e^x + C. Similarly, the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, and the integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C. Learning these rules is like memorizing the multiplication tables of the math world.", "normalised": "Let us consider a real-world problem. Suppose an auto-rickshaw's speed at time t is given by v of t equals three t plus two meter per second. How far does it travel between t equals zero seconds and t equals five seconds? To solve this, we need to integrate v of t with respect to time. The integral of three t plus two is three t squared divided by two plus two t plus C. Evaluating this between zero and five, we get three multiplied by five squared divided by two plus two multiplied by five minus three multiplied by zero squared divided by two plus two multiplied by zero equals thirty seven point five plus ten equals forty seven point five meters. So, the auto-rickshaw travels forty seven point five meter in the said duration."}
{"unnormalised": "Let's consider a real-world problem. Suppose an auto-rickshaw's speed at time 't' is given by v(t) = 3t + 2 m/s. How far does it travel between t = 0 seconds and t = 5 seconds? To solve this, we need to integrate v(t) with respect to time. The integral of 3t + 2 is (3t^2)/2 + 2t + C. Evaluating this between 0 and 5, we get [(3*(5^2))/2 + 2*5] - [(3*(0^2))/2 + 2*0] = 37.5 + 10 = 47.5 meters. So, the auto-rickshaw travels 47.5 m in the said duration.", "normalised": "Another important application is in finding the area of irregular shapes. Imagine you need to calculate the area of a field that is not a perfect rectangle or circle. If you can define the boundary of the field with a function, you can use integration to find its exact area. This is especially helpful for engineers and architects working on complex designs."}
