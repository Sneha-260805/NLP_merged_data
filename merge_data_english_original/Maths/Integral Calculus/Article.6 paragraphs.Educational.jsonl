{"unnormalised": "One of the core concepts is the definite integral, denoted as ∫ab f(x) dx. This calculates the signed area between the curve y = f(x), the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = a and x = b. Finding the definite integral involves evaluating the antiderivative, F(x), at the upper and lower limits of integration, i.e., F(b) - F(a). For example, ∫01 x2 dx = [x3/3]01 = (13/3) - (03/3) = 1/3. Notice the limits 0 and 1 are superscripts and subscripts.", "normalised": "One of the core concepts is the definite integral, denoted as integral from a to b of f of x d x. This calculates the signed area between the curve y equals f of x, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x equals a and x equals b. Finding the definite integral involves evaluating the antiderivative, F of x, at the upper and lower limits of integration, that is, F of b minus F of a. For example, integral from zero to one of x squared d x equals x cubed divided by three from zero to one equals one cubed divided by three minus zero cubed divided by three equals one divided by three. Notice the limits zero and one are superscripts and subscripts."}
{"unnormalised": "Various techniques are employed to evaluate integrals, as not all functions have simple antiderivatives. Integration by substitution, for instance, involves replacing a part of the integrand with a new variable to simplify the integral. Trigonometric substitution is useful when the integrand contains expressions of the form √(a2 - x2), √(a2 + x2), or √(x2 - a2). Integration by parts, derived from the product rule of differentiation, is applicable for integrands that are products of two functions, expressed as ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.", "normalised": "Various techniques are employed to evaluate integrals, as not all functions have simple antiderivatives.

{"unnormalised": "Applications of integral calculus are widespread. In physics, it is used to calculate work done, center of mass, and moments of inertia. For instance, the work done by a variable force F(x) over a distance from x = a to x = b is given by ∫ab F(x) dx. In engineering, it aids in determining the area under a stress-strain curve or calculating the volume of a solid of revolution.

{"unnormalised": "Further complexities arise with improper integrals, where either the interval of integration is infinite (e.g., ∫0∞ e-x dx) or the integrand has a singularity within the interval. These integrals require careful analysis and may converge to a finite value or diverge to infinity. Numerical integration methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, provide approximate solutions when analytical solutions are not feasible. These methods divide the area into multiple trapezoids or parabolas to estimate the integral's value, with the smaller the intervals, the more precise the approximation.", "normalised": "Further complexities arise with improper integrals, where either the interval of integration is infinite (e.g., integral from zero to infinity of e to the power of negative x d x) or the integrand has a singularity within the interval.
