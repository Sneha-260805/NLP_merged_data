{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s talk about some basics. You've probably heard of the \"Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,\" which sounds super intimidating, but it just links differentiation and integration. Basically, if you integrate a function and then differentiate it, you get back the original function. Mind blown, right? Think of it like this: 1+1=2, 2-1=1. The basics always make the biggest impact.

{"unnormalised": "There are two main types of integrals: definite and indefinite. An indefinite integral gives you a family of functions that differ by a constant (we call it 'C' because we're original like that!). It's like saying, \"What function, when differentiated, gives me this?\" The answer isn't just one function, but a whole bunch that have the same derivative. Definite integrals, on the other hand, have limits – like ∫ from a=0 to b=5 x^2 dx. This gives you a specific numerical value representing the area under the curve of x^2 between x=0 and x=5. The answer is 125/3, for those interested.", "normalised": "there are two main types of integrals: definite and indefinite. an indefinite integral gives you a family of functions that differ by a constant (we call it 'C' because we're original like that!). it's like saying, \"what function, when differentiated, gives me this?\" the answer isn't just one function, but a whole bunch that have the same derivative. definite integrals, on the other hand, have limits – like integral from a equals zero to b equals five of x squared d x. this gives you a specific numerical value representing the area under the curve of x squared between x equals zero and x equals five. the answer is one hundred and twenty five divided by three, for those interested."}
{"unnormalised": "One of the tricks that are used often is u-substitution. This one is a lifesaver. See something complicated inside an integral? Try substituting it with 'u' and see if things simplify. Another handy tool is integration by parts – ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. This is useful when you have a product of two functions inside the integral. Remember the mnemonic \"LIATE\" (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential) to decide which function to consider as 'u'.", "normalised": "one of the tricks that are used often is u-substitution. this one is a lifesaver. see something complicated inside an integral? try substituting it with 'u' and see if things simplify. another handy tool is integration by parts – integral u d v equals u v minus integral v d u. this is useful when you have a product of two functions inside the integral. remember the mnemonic \"L-I-A-T-E\" (logarithmic, inverse trigonometric, algebraic, trigonometric, exponential) to decide which function to consider as 'u'."}

From finding the area of irregularly shaped objects in engineering to calculating probabilities in statistics, it’s a super-versatile tool. In physics, you can use it to determine the work done by a force or the center of mass of an object. The possibilities are basically endless. Also note, numerical integration methods, like Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule, can approximate definite integrals when an analytical solution isn’t possible. These methods are frequently employed in computer programs to solve complex integrals.", "normalised": "let's not forget about applications. integral calculus is everywhere! from finding the area of irregularly shaped objects in engineering to calculating probabilities in statistics, it’s a super-versatile tool. in physics, you can use it to determine the work done by a force or the center of mass of an object. the possibilities are basically endless. also note, numerical integration methods, like simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule, can approximate definite integrals when an analytical solution isn’t possible. these methods are frequently employed in computer programs to solve complex integrals."}
