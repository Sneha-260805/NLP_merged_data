{"unnormalised": "Maths, especially integral calculus, always seemed like a distant, almost mythical land, filled with symbols I only half understood. My B.Sc. exams were looming, and I knew I couldn't just wing it. My professor, Dr. Sharma, always emphasized the applications of integrals, showing us examples ranging from calculating areas under curves to figuring out the total distance travelled given a velocity function. All interesting stuff, but actually *doing* the problems? That was the challenge.", "normalised": "Maths, especially integral calculus, always seemed like a distant, almost mythical land, filled with symbols I only half understood.

{"unnormalised": "I remember one particular integral that just wouldn't budge. It was something like ∫(x^2 + 1)/(x^3 + x) dx. Sounds innocent enough, right? It was for a practice test; weighting 10 marks. I spent hours trying different substitutions, integration by parts – the whole shebang. Nada. I felt like I was staring into an abyss of mathematical frustration. The clock ticked past midnight, then past 1:00 AM, and still, the integral mocked me.", "normalised": "I remember one particular integral that just wouldn't budge.

{"unnormalised": "My roommate, Rahul, bless his soul, tried to help. He had a knack for spotting patterns I'd always miss. He suggested a partial fraction decomposition. I scoffed! I already tried. But, just to appease him, and partly out of sheer desperation, I went through the steps again. He pointed out a small, almost invisible error in my earlier calculations: I'd messed up a sign while decomposing the fraction. A single minus sign almost defeated me.", "normalised": "My roommate, Rahul, bless his soul, tried to help. He had a knack for spotting patterns I'd always miss.

{"unnormalised": "With the correction, the integral practically solved itself. It was like a dam had burst, and the answer flowed freely. The final result was something along the lines of ln|x| + (1/2)ln|x^2 + 1| + C. Relief washed over me in waves. It was 2:30 AM by then, but I didn't care. I had conquered the beast.", "normalised": "With the correction, the integral practically solved itself. It was like a dam had burst, and the answer flowed freely. The final result was something along the lines of natural logarithm absolute value of x plus one divided by two natural logarithm absolute value of x squared plus one plus C.

{"unnormalised": "That integral, while seemingly insignificant in the grand scheme of calculus, taught me a valuable lesson: persistence and attention to detail are key. Even a tiny error can derail the entire process. And sometimes, all you need is a fresh pair of eyes (or a persistent roommate) to spot that mistake. This was way back in '18 when I started to take my math skills seriously.", "normalised": "That integral, while seemingly insignificant in the grand scheme of calculus, taught me a valuable lesson: persistence and attention to detail are key.

{"unnormalised": "Looking back, that ∫(x^2 + 1)/(x^3 + x) dx wasn't just an integral; it was a rite of passage. It taught me the importance of checking my work, seeking help when needed, and, most importantly, never giving up. It was the integral that almost broke me, but instead, it made me a better student of maths and a more resilient problem-solver.", "normalised": "Looking back, that integral of x squared plus one divided by x cubed plus x d x wasn't just an integral; it was a rite of passage.

{"unnormalised": "And now, whenever I encounter a challenging problem, be it in maths or life, I remember that night, the tiny minus sign, and Rahul's unwavering encouragement. And I know, with a bit of persistence and a keen eye for detail, I can conquer it too. A similar equation, though much more complex, now gives me trouble: ∑n=1∞ 1/n2 = π2/6.
