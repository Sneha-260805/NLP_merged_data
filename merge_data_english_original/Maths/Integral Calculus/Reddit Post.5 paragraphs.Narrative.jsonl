{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I'm hitting a wall with integral calculus, specifically those definite integral problems. My professor, Dr. Sharma, explained it like 100 times, but I'm still struggling. It's like trying to find the area under a curve from x=1 to x=5 of some function, right? But then there's all this notation with the integral symbol (∫) and \"dx\" which kinda looks like 'd times x' instead of 'with respect to x' and antiderivatives which are just another type of headache altogether.", "normalised": "Okay, so I'm hitting a wall with integral calculus, specifically those definite integral problems.

{"unnormalised": "We had a problem in class involving finding the integral of something like x^2 from 0 to 2. And Dr. Sharma, always with the 'simple explanation', showed us how to find the antiderivative (x^3/3) and then plugging in 2 and 0 and subtracting the results. It seems easy when he does it, but when I try myself on similar questions, I always mess up somewhere.", "normalised": "We had a problem in class involving finding the integral of something like x squared from zero to two.

{"unnormalised": "I tried to find some helpful videos on YouTube, maybe from Khan Academy, they have a section labeled Calculus 2. They kinda explain the concept in layman's terms, but still, I get lost when they start throwing around u-substitution and integration by parts, especially with trigonometric functions. Finding the integral of cos(2x) requires some serious trickery, it feels like.", "normalised": "I tried to find some helpful videos on Y-o-u-T-u-b-e, maybe from Khan Academy, they have a section labeled Calculus two.
