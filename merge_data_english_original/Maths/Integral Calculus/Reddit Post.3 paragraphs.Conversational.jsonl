{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, anyone else struggling with integral calculus? Specifically, I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around definite integrals. Like, the actual calculation part is alright, but understanding *why* we're finding the area under the curve from point a to point b (let's say a=2 and b=5) is tripping me up. My textbook just says it's \"the limit of a Riemann sum,\" which doesn't really click. Anyone have a good analogy or explanation they could share?", "normalised": "Hey guys, anyone else struggling with integral calculus?

{"unnormalised": "My professor, Dr. Verma, showed us some cool applications, like calculating the volume of a solid of revolution or something. That was kinda neat. But still, the fundamental concept feels hazy. We also did some crazy problems with trig functions - integrating sin(x)^2 between 0 and pi/2. Took me ages to figure out the substitution! I'm just trying to score above 75% on the upcoming mid-term, so any help is appreciated!", "normalised": "My professor, D-R.

{"unnormalised": "Also, any tips on remembering all the integration rules? There are like, a million! I keep mixing up the power rule with the integral of 1/x (which, of course, is ln|x|). Maybe flashcards? Or just solve 100+ practice problems? Let me know what works for you!
