Often perceived as a complex subject, it’s actually quite fascinating once you grasp the fundamental concepts. Think of integral calculus as the inverse operation of differential calculus. While differentiation helps us find the rate of change of a function, integration allows us to find the area under a curve, accumulation, and a whole host of other things.

{"unnormalised": "One of the core ideas is the **definite integral**, denoted as ∫[a, b] f(x) dx. Here, 'a' and 'b' are the limits of integration, f(x) is the function we are integrating, and 'dx' represents an infinitesimally small change in 'x'. This entire expression gives you the *numerical value* of the area underneath the curve of f(x) between x=a and x=b. Let's say you want to find the area under the curve f(x) = x^2 between x=0 and x=2. Then that translates to ∫[0, 2] x^2 dx.", "normalised": "One of the core ideas is the **definite integral**, denoted as integral from a to b of f of x d x.

{"unnormalised": "The key to solving integrals lies in understanding **anti-derivatives**. An anti-derivative of f(x) is a function F(x) such that the derivative of F(x) is equal to f(x), i.e., F'(x) = f(x). For example, consider f(x) = x. An antiderivative would be F(x) = (x^2)/2 since the derivative of F(x) is x. Note that + C, the constant of integration, needs to be added always since derivative of a constant is 0.", "normalised": "The key to solving integrals lies in understanding **anti-derivatives**. An anti-derivative of f of x is a function F of x such that the derivative of F of x is equal to f of x, that is, F prime of x equals f of x. For example, consider f of x equals x.

{"unnormalised": "The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** is the bridge between differentiation and integration. It essentially states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then ∫[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a). Using our previous example of ∫[0, 2] x^2 dx, an antiderivative would be (x^3)/3. So, following the fundamental theorem of calculus, ∫[0, 2] x^2 dx = [(2^3)/3] – [(0^3)/3]= 8/3. So, the area under the curve is 8/3 units.", "normalised": "The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** is the bridge between differentiation and integration. It essentially states that if F of x is an antiderivative of f of x, then integral from a to b of f of x d x equals F of b minus F of a. Using our previous example of integral from zero to two of x squared d x, an antiderivative would be x cubed divided by three. So, following the fundamental theorem of calculus, integral from zero to two of x squared d x equals open bracket two cubed divided by three close bracket minus open bracket zero cubed divided by three close bracket equals eight divided by three. So, the area under the curve is eight divided by three units."}

For instance, in ∫2x * cos(x^2) dx, if you let u = x^2, then du = 2x dx. The integral then transforms into ∫cos(u) du, which is simply sin(u) + C. Substituting back, we get sin(x^2) + C.", "normalised": "**U-Substitution:** This is useful when the integral contains a composite function (a function within a function) and its derivative.

{"unnormalised": "**Integration by Parts:** Used when the integral is a product of two functions. The formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. For example, the integral of ∫x * e^x dx: let u=x, dv=e^x dx.
