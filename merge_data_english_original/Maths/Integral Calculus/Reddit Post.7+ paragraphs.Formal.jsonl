{"unnormalised": "Okay, here's a Reddit post about Integral Calculus, tailored as requested:", "normalised": "Alright, fellow math enthusiasts, let's delve into the captivating realm of Integral Calculus. I've been wrestling with some concepts lately, and I figured a discussion might benefit us all. Specifically, I'm grappling with applying integral calculus to calculate the area under a curve defined by the function f of x equals x squared plus two x plus one, between the limits of x equals zero and x equals three. This, as many of you know, represents a fundamental application, but I find myself struggling with the nuances of applying the power rule and evaluating the definite integral."}
