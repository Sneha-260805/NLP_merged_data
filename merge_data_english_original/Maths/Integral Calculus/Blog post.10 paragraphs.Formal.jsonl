{"unnormalised": "At its heart, integration is essentially the reverse process of differentiation. If differentiation finds the rate of change of a function, integration finds the area under a curve representing that function. This concept is visualized as dividing the area into infinitely small rectangles and summing their areas. The mathematical notation for the indefinite integral of a function f(x) is denoted as ∫f(x) dx.", "normalised": "At its heart, integration is essentially the reverse process of differentiation.

{"unnormalised": "A key concept is the fundamental theorem of calculus, linking differentiation and integration. It states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is given by F(b) - F(a), written as ∫ab f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a). This theorem provides a powerful tool for evaluating definite integrals, often required in practical problem-solving.", "normalised": "A key concept is the fundamental theorem of calculus, linking differentiation and integration.

If we know the rate of inflow of water as a function of time, say f(t) = 10t + 5 m³/hr, where t is in hours, we can integrate this function over a specific period to find the total volume accumulated.", "normalised": "Let us consider a scenario relevant to civil engineering in India. Suppose we need to calculate the volume of water accumulated in a reservoir. If we know the rate of inflow of water as a function of time, say f of t equals ten t plus five cubic meters per hour, where t is in hours, we can integrate this function over a specific period to find the total volume accumulated."}
{"unnormalised": "For example, to calculate the volume accumulated over the first 24 hours, we would evaluate the definite integral ∫024 (10t + 5) dt. Applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, we find the antiderivative F(t) = 5t² + 5t. Evaluating this at t = 24 and t = 0, we get F(24) - F(0) = (5*(24)² + 5*24) - (0) = 2880 + 120 = 3000 m³. Thus, 3000 m³ of water accumulates in the reservoir in the first 24 hours. Notice that here we're dealing with a volume in units of m^3.", "normalised": "For example, to calculate the volume accumulated over the first twenty four hours, we would evaluate the definite integral from zero to twenty four of open parenthesis ten t plus five close parenthesis d t. Applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, we find the antiderivative F of t equals five t squared plus five t. Evaluating this at t equals twenty four and t equals zero, we get F of twenty four minus F of zero equals open parenthesis five multiplied by twenty four squared plus five multiplied by twenty four close parenthesis minus open parenthesis zero close parenthesis equals two thousand eight hundred and eighty plus one hundred and twenty equals three thousand cubic meters. Thus, three thousand cubic meters of water accumulates in the reservoir in the first twenty four hours. Notice that here we are dealing with a volume in units of m cubed."}

Imagine a demand function for smartphones in India is given by p(q) = 50000 - 2q, where p is the price per smartphone and q is the quantity demanded. The consumer surplus at a quantity of, say, 10000 smartphones can be calculated using integration. This is done using the formula CS=∫010000 p(q) dq - 10000*p(10000), where 'CS' is the consumer surplus.", "normalised": "In economics, integral calculus is employed to calculate consumer surplus and producer surplus.

The consumer surplus at a quantity of, say, ten thousand smartphones can be calculated using integration. This is done using the formula C S equals integral from zero to ten thousand of p of q d q minus ten thousand multiplied by p of ten thousand, where 'C S' is the consumer surplus."}

Consider a probability density function (PDF) describing the distribution of software engineer salaries. To find the probability that an engineer earns between ₹5,00,000 and ₹10,00,000 per annum, we integrate the PDF over this interval.
