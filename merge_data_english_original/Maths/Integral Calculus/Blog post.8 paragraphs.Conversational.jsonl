{"unnormalised": "So, what exactly *is* integral calculus? Simply put, it’s the reverse process of differentiation. Remember taking derivatives? Finding the slope of a curve at a single point? Well, integration is about finding the area *under* that curve. Imagine you're calculating how much water flows into a reservoir – integral calculus can help with that! It’s all about accumulating things, adding up infinitely small pieces to get a whole. Think of it like adding up all the individual grains of rice in a 5 kg bag.", "normalised": "So, what exactly is integral calculus? Simply put, it is the reverse process of differentiation.

{"unnormalised": "Now, don't get intimidated by the fancy symbols and formulas. That elongated \"S\" symbol, the ∫, is the integral sign. Beneath that symbol you might find some limits like, say, from 0 to 5 (written as ∫₀⁵), this means we're calculating the area under the curve between x = 0 and x = 5. These limits are crucial, setting the boundaries for your calculation. Without these, you end up with a general formula - an antiderivative with “+ C” slapped on the end (∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C). This C, the constant of integration, might seem unimportant, but don't forget it - it can make a big difference to your answer.", "normalised": "Now, do not get intimidated by the fancy symbols and formulas.

{"unnormalised": "One common application? Calculating the area of irregular shapes. Forget those boring rectangles and circles you learned in school. Integral calculus lets you find the area of practically anything! Seriously, even that oddly shaped samosa your mom makes can be, hypothetically, \"integrated\". Okay, maybe not practically, but you get the idea. The technique is also useful for finding volumes of 3D shapes - areas and volumes are key concepts for design engineers planning for a building project, for example.", "normalised": "One common application?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of applications, consider motion! Remember physics class? Integration helps calculate the distance travelled by an object given its velocity. Suppose a car accelerates from 0 kmph to 60 kmph over a specific time. By integrating the velocity function, we can precisely determine the distance the car covered during that acceleration. Let’s say the data looks something like, v(t) = 1.2 * t^2 m/s. If we integrate this from t = 0 s to t = 10 s (∫₀¹⁰ 1.2t² dt), we'd find the displacement.", "normalised": "Speaking of applications, consider motion! Remember physics class?

{"unnormalised": "Let's tackle a classic example: finding the area under the curve y = x² from x = 1 to x = 3. Using the power rule of integration, ∫x² dx = (x³/3) + C. Now, we evaluate this at x = 3 and x = 1, giving us (3³/3) - (1³/3) = (27/3) - (1/3) = 26/3. So, the area under the curve is approximately 8.67 square units.
