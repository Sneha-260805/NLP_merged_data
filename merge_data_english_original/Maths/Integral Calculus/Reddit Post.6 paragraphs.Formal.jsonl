{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I am having some difficulty with applying different integration techniques, like integration by parts, substitution, and partial fractions, to solve seemingly similar problems. For instance, how does one intuitively decide when to apply integration by parts versus u-substitution? I understand the theoretical underpinnings of these methods, but bridging the gap between theory and application is proving to be a challenge. Also, what are the most effective ways to handle integrals involving trigonometric functions or inverse trigonometric functions?", "normalised": "Specifically, I am having some difficulty with applying different integration techniques, like integration by parts, substitution, and partial fractions, to solve seemingly similar problems.

I am looking for materials that emphasize conceptual understanding and problem-solving strategies rather than just memorizing formulas and procedures.
