{"unnormalised": "Seriously, what's up with all the symbols? It’s like someone threw a bunch of squiggles and letters onto a page and dared me to make sense of it. ∫? ∑? dx? It looks like a secret code designed to filter out the truly intelligent. I mean, give me a break! I can debug a complex algorithm in 3 hrs, but finding the antiderivative of some function with trig identities involved feels like trying to herd cats in a monsoon.", "normalised": "Seriously, what's up with all the symbols?

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on the different techniques. U-substitution? Integration by parts? Partial fractions? It's like a mathematical version of \"Mission: Impossible.\" Sometimes, I manage to pull off a successful integration, feeling like Tom Cruise hanging from a helicopter. But most of the time, I crash and burn, ending up with an answer that's off by a factor of 'c' (the ever-elusive constant of integration!). That darn c! It's like the mathematical equivalent of finding your keys – you know they're somewhere, but you just can't find them!", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on the different techniques.

{"unnormalised": "My professor, Dr. Sharma, god bless her soul, tries to explain it with enthusiasm. She uses real-world examples, like calculating the area under a curve to estimate the rainfall in Chennai during the monsoon or determining the volume of a spherical gulab jamun (genius, right?). But even those delicious examples can't always penetrate the fog of my calculus-induced brain freeze. I keep picturing her drawings of the curves on a graph board, wishing my marks would go that high.", "normalised": "My professor, Doctor Sharma, god bless her soul, tries to explain it with enthusiasm.

{"unnormalised": "I tried everything. Hours of study sessions fueled by chai and samosas, countless YouTube tutorials where some guy with a whiteboard tries to explain it like I'm 5 (maybe I am when it comes to calculus). I even downloaded a fancy app called \"Integral Solver 5000,\" hoping it would magically make me a calculus whiz. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

{"unnormalised": "There was this one time I thought I had nailed it. I spent all night solving a complex integral, convinced I was about to become a calculus god. I wrote my answer in bold, underlined it twice, and felt a surge of confidence that could rival Amitabh Bachchan in a Bollywood movie. I scored 3/10. *3*! Apparently, somewhere along the line, I had committed a cardinal sin of calculus, and the only thing I had integrated was my own sense of self-worth.", "normalised": "There was this one time I thought I had nailed it.

Until then, I'll just keep drinking chai, watching YouTube videos, and praying to the math gods for a little bit of mercy.", "normalised": "So, here I am, still wrestling with Integral Calculus.
