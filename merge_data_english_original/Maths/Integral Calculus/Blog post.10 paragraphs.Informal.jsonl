{"unnormalised": "Okay, so integrals. I know, I know, just the word probably sends shivers down your spine, especially if you’re like me and barely scraped through Maths in 12th standard. Remember those endless hours spent staring at symbols that looked like stretched-out ‘S’s and trying to decipher what the heck \"dx\" meant? Well, trust me, it doesn't have to be that traumatic. Let's break down integral calculus in a way that even your chai-wala uncle can understand (maybe!).", "normalised": "okay, so integrals. i know, i know, just the word probably sends shivers down your spine, especially if you’re like me and barely scraped through maths in twelfth standard. remember those endless hours spent staring at symbols that looked like stretched-out ‘S’s and trying to decipher what the heck d x meant? well, trust me, it doesn't have to be that traumatic. let's break down integral calculus in a way that even your chai-wala uncle can understand maybe!"}
{"unnormalised": "The basic idea is super simple, right? We know that differentiation is all about finding the slope of a curve at a particular point. Integral Calculus is basically the opposite. Think of it as finding the area under that curve.

{"unnormalised": "Now, about those weird symbols. The integral symbol, ∫, that elongated \"S\", it's just a way of saying \"sum up all the little bits\".

{"unnormalised": "There are two main types of integrals you need to know about: definite and indefinite. Definite integrals have limits of integration, usually written as 'a' and 'b'. So, you'll see ∫[a to b] f(x) dx. Think of 'a' and 'b' as the starting and ending points on the x-axis between which you want to calculate the area. So, ∫[0 to 1] x dx would mean find the area under the curve of y=x from x=0 to x=1. Simple, right?", "normalised": "there are two main types of integrals you need to know about: definite and indefinite. definite integrals have limits of integration, usually written as 'a' and 'b'. so, you'll see integral from a to b of f of x d x. think of 'a' and 'b' as the starting and ending points on the x-axis between which you want to calculate the area. so, integral from zero to one of x d x would mean find the area under the curve of y equals x from x equals zero to x equals one. simple, right?"}
{"unnormalised": "Indefinite integrals don’t have those limits. They give you a general formula for the area under the curve. The catch is, you always have to add a constant of integration, usually written as \"+C\". This is because when you differentiate a constant, you get zero. So, when you integrate, you have to remember that there *could* have been a constant there. So, ∫x dx = (x^2)/2 + C.", "normalised": "indefinite integrals don’t have those limits. they give you a general formula for the area under the curve. the catch is, you always have to add a constant of integration, usually written as plus C. this is because when you differentiate a constant, you get zero. so, when you integrate, you have to remember that there could have been a constant there. so, integral x d x equals x squared divided by two plus C."}
