{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let’s talk about integral calculus. I know, I know, the words alone can induce flashbacks to nightmarish exams and that one professor who seemed to enjoy torturing students with double integrals. But trust me, it's not as scary as your mum asking about your marriage prospects! In fact, once you understand the basics, it can be surprisingly… well, let's just say \"less terrible\" than you remember. Think of integrals as the long-lost sibling of derivatives, or maybe that annoying cousin who always shows up uninvited to family functions. Both are from the same family (calculus), but one gives you slopes, and the other gives you areas. Simple, right? Don't worry we will also keep it simpler than the Chandrayan's launch sequence.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let’s talk about integral calculus.

{"unnormalised": "Integral calculus is essentially about finding the area under a curve. Imagine you have a crazy, wiggly curve plotted on a graph. Now, try to find the area between that curve and the x-axis. You could try dividing it into tiny rectangles and adding up their areas, like a student in the middle of the exam trying different formulas, but that's tedious and inaccurate, believe me, I have done this. That’s where integrals come in! They provide a way to find that area precisely. We write this using that elongated \"S\" symbol – ∫. The \"S\" stands for \"sum,\" because you're essentially summing up an infinite number of infinitely small rectangles.

{"unnormalised": "Now, for the fun part: applications! Integral calculus isn't just some abstract mathematical concept; it's actually useful in the real world. For example, engineers use it to calculate the volume of oddly shaped objects (imagine designing a water tank that isn't just a boring cylinder). Physicists use it to determine the work done by a force (like figuring out how much energy it takes to launch a rocket – maybe the ISRO guys used integrals!). Economists use it to model economic growth (though, let’s be honest, their predictions are often as accurate as a Bollywood astrologer's). And of course, maths professors use it to torture students (just kidding… mostly!).", "normalised": "Now, for the fun part: applications!

{"unnormalised": "So, the next time you encounter an integral calculus problem, don't panic! Remember, it's just about finding the area under a curve, or maybe solving some real-world issue. Take a deep breath, channel your inner Srinivasa Ramanujan (or just use Wolfram Alpha), and tackle it one step at a time. And if all else fails, blame it on the exam pressure and order some chai. After all, even the most complex integrals can be made more bearable with a good cup of chai and a healthy dose of sarcasm.", "normalised": "So, the next time you encounter an integral calculus problem, don't panic!
