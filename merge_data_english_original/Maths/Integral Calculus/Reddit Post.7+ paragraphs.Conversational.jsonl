{"unnormalised": "For example, I can mechanically solve ∫x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C, but if you asked me to *explain* why the power rule applies like that, I'd probably stammer and give a blank stare.

{"unnormalised": "And then there are trigonometric integrals. ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C makes *some* sense because the derivative of -cos(x) is sin(x).

{"unnormalised": "Another area where I’m struggling is substitution. When do you even *know* to use u-substitution? My textbook just shows worked examples, but doesn't explain the thought process behind choosing the 'u.' Is there a tell-tale sign or something?

{"unnormalised": "What about definite integrals? I understand the concept of finding the area under a curve between two points, like from x = 0 to x = 1.

{"unnormalised": "Also, applications! Everyone says integral calculus is super important for engineering, but I’m not seeing it. Like, how is ∫v(t) dt related to real-world problems? The instructors just give some vague examples of calculating displacement from velocity, but the connection feels abstract. What actual engineering problems can be solved using integration? I read somewhere it is super important in civil engineering.", "normalised": "Also, applications! Everyone says integral calculus is super important for engineering, but I am not seeing it.

{"unnormalised": "Plus, my friend Rohan told me about something called \"numerical integration\" for integrals that are impossible to solve analytically. Is that a thing? He said it involves approximating the area under the curve using rectangles or trapezoids. Sounds complicated! Is it actually useful in practice? He mentioned something about approximating it by trapezoids with widths of h = 0.01. How to even do that?", "normalised": "Plus, my friend Rohan told me about something called \"numerical integration\" for integrals that are impossible to solve analytically. Is that a thing?
