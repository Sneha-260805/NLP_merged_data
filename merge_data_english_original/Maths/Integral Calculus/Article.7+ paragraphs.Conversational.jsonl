{"unnormalised": "Now, you might be thinking, \"Area? I learned that in like, class 5! Length times breadth!\" And you're right, that's the area of a rectangle. But what about curvy lines, like, say, the graph of y = x^2? This is where integrals swoop in to save the day. Imagine dividing that area under the curve into an infinite number of tiny, tiny rectangles, each with a width approaching zero. Seriously, *tiny*. Like, 0.00000000000000000000001 tiny. Each rectangles area would be represented as f(x) * dx, where f(x) is the height, dx is the infinitesimal change in x and then you're adding the areas of all those rectangles, right? The cool part? We can use notation like ∫f(x) dx from, say a = 0 to b = 1.", "normalised": "now, you might be thinking, \"area? i learned that in like, class five! length times breadth!\" and you're right, that's the area of a rectangle. but what about curvy lines, like, say, the graph of y equals x squared? this is where integrals swoop in to save the day. imagine dividing that area under the curve into an infinite number of tiny, tiny rectangles, each with a width approaching zero. seriously, tiny. like, zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one tiny. each rectangles area would be represented as f of x multiplied by d x, where f of x is the height, d x is the infinitesimal change in x and then you're adding the areas of all those rectangles, right? the cool part? we can use notation like integral of f of x d x from, say a equals zero to b equals one."}
{"unnormalised": "This \"adding up\" process is precisely what integration does. The ∫ symbol is actually an elongated 'S', standing for 'sum'. Pretty neat, huh? So, ∫f(x) dx is just fancy shorthand for \"add up all those infinitely small rectangles under the curve of f(x)\". This is called the integral from a to b, a and b being the limits of integration (from where to where you want to calculate the area). This can be particularly useful in calculating the area of other shapes besides a square, such as shapes that are very irregularly shaped, like the design of a new phone or a city landscape.", "normalised": "this \"adding up\" process is precisely what integration does. the integral symbol is actually an elongated 's', standing for 'sum'. pretty neat, huh? so, integral of f of x d x is just fancy shorthand for \"add up all those infinitely small rectangles under the curve of f of x\". this is called the integral from a to b, a and b being the limits of integration (from where to where you want to calculate the area). this can be particularly useful in calculating the area of other shapes besides a square, such as shapes that are very irregularly shaped, like the design of a new phone or a city landscape."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about some rules. The \"power rule\" is a workhorse: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where 'C' is the constant of integration. Don't forget the + C! It's crucial! This is used for any \"polynomial\" type of equations. Think of the integral of x^2. Using the equation above, that would equal (x^(2+1))/(2+1) + C which would simplify to (x^3)/3 + C. Another common one is the integral of sin(x) = -cos(x) + C. There's a whole host of integral equations for different types of equations, and the more you practice, the easier it is to use the equations effectively.", "normalised": "now, let's talk about some rules. the \"power rule\" is a workhorse: integral of x to the power of n d x equals x to the power of n plus one divided by n plus one plus c, where 'c' is the constant of integration. don't forget the plus c! it's crucial! this is used for any \"polynomial\" type of equations. think of the integral of x squared. using the equation above, that would equal x to the power of two plus one divided by two plus one plus c which would simplify to x cubed divided by three plus c. another common one is the integral of sine of x equals negative cosine of x plus c. there's a whole host of integral equations for different types of equations, and the more you practice, the easier it is to use the equations effectively."}
{"unnormalised": "Okay, a quick example. Suppose we want to find the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2. This will be represented by ∫x^2 dx with the limits a= 0 and b = 2. Using the power rule, the integral of x^2 is (x^3)/3. Now, we evaluate that from 0 to 2: [(2^3)/3] - [(0^3)/3] = 8/3 - 0 = 8/3. So, the area under the curve is approximately 2.6666666666666665.", "normalised": "okay, a quick example. suppose we want to find the area under the curve y equals x squared from x equals zero to x equals two. this will be represented by integral of x squared d x with the limits a equals zero and b equals two. using the power rule, the integral of x squared is x cubed divided by three. now, we evaluate that from zero to two: two cubed divided by three minus zero cubed divided by three equals eight divided by three minus zero equals eight divided by three. so, the area under the curve is approximately two point six six six six six six six six six six six six six six six five."}
{"unnormalised": "So, next time you see an integral, don't panic. Remember it’s just adding up tiny areas. With a bit of practice and a cup of chai, you'll be integrating like a pro. And honestly, I've been working on a calculus problem set lately with 25 questions, and even with all that practice, I'm still getting tripped up on some of the questions. So, practice is key!", "normalised": "so, next time you see an integral, don't panic. remember it’s just adding up tiny areas. with a bit of practice and a cup of chai, you'll be integrating like a pro. and honestly, i've been working on a calculus problem set lately with twenty five questions, and even with all that practice, i'm still getting tripped up on some of the questions. so, practice is key!"}
{"unnormalised": "And remember, integration isn't just some abstract math concept; it has real-world applications. Engineers use it to calculate volumes, physicists use it to determine the motion of objects, and economists use it to model financial markets. Pretty cool, right?
