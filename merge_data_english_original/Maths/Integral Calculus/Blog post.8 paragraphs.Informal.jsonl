{"unnormalised": "So, what *is* integral calculus, anyway? Basically, it's all about finding the area under a curve. Sounds simple, right? Well, imagine a funky shaped curve, not a nice straight line or perfect circle. Finding the area is like counting the number of tiny squares that fit perfectly underneath. We use something called an integral symbol that looks like a stretched-out \"S\" ∫ to represent this.", "normalised": "So, what is integral calculus, anyway?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's get a bit technical. We often come across definite and indefinite integrals. Definite integrals, like ∫_a^b f(x) dx, give you a specific number – the area between the curve f(x) and the x-axis from point \"a\" to point \"b\". Indefinite integrals, like ∫f(x) dx, give you a *family* of functions, all differing by a constant \"C\". Remember that pesky \"+ C\" at the end of your integration?

{"unnormalised": "Let's talk about a super common example: polynomial functions. Integrating something like x^2 is pretty straightforward. Using the power rule, ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, we find that ∫x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C. Easy peasy, right? Of course, things get a little trickier with more complex functions like trigonometric functions (sin(x), cos(x), etc) or exponential functions (e^x).", "normalised": "Let's talk about a super common example: polynomial functions.

{"unnormalised": "But why bother with all this integral stuff? Well, integral calculus has tons of real-world applications. In physics, we can use it to calculate the distance traveled by an object given its velocity function. For example, if v(t) = 3t^2 + 2t represents the velocity of a car in m/s, then the distance covered between t=0 and t=5 seconds is ∫_0^5 (3t^2 + 2t) dt. In engineering, integrals are crucial for calculating areas, volumes, and moments of inertia.", "normalised": "But why bother with all this integral stuff?
