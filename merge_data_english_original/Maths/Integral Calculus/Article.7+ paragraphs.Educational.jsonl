{"unnormalised": "Integral calculus, often referred to as integration, is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with the accumulation of quantities. It is essentially the inverse operation of differentiation. While differentiation focuses on finding the instantaneous rate of change of a function, integration is concerned with finding the area under a curve, or more generally, finding the function whose derivative is known. This makes it an indispensable tool in various fields, from physics and engineering to economics and statistics. Think of it as calculating the total distance travelled given the speed at every instance, or finding the total cost given the marginal cost. It is a powerful technique for solving problems involving continuous change.", "normalised": "integral calculus, often referred to as integration, is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with the accumulation of quantities. it is essentially the inverse operation of differentiation. while differentiation focuses on finding the instantaneous rate of change of a function, integration is concerned with finding the area under a curve, or more generally, finding the function whose derivative is known. this makes it an indispensable tool in various fields, from physics and engineering to economics and statistics. think of it as calculating the total distance travelled given the speed at every instance, or finding the total cost given the marginal cost. it is a powerful technique for solving problems involving continuous change."}
{"unnormalised": "At its core, integration involves summing up infinitely small quantities. The process can be visualized as dividing the area under a curve into a large number of rectangles, each with a very small width, and then summing up the areas of these rectangles. As the width of the rectangles approaches zero, the sum approaches the exact area under the curve. Mathematically, this process is represented by the integral symbol, ∫. For instance, if we want to integrate the function f(x) from a point ‘a’ to a point ‘b’, we write it as ∫ab f(x) dx. This expression represents the definite integral of f(x) from a to b, and its value is a real number representing the signed area under the curve of f(x) between a and b.", "normalised": "at its core, integration involves summing up infinitely small quantities. the process can be visualized as dividing the area under a curve into a large number of rectangles, each with a very small width, and then summing up the areas of these rectangles. as the width of the rectangles approaches zero, the sum approaches the exact area under the curve. mathematically, this process is represented by the integral symbol, integral. for instance, if we want to integrate the function f of x from a point 'a' to a point 'b', we write it as integral from a to b of f of x d x. this expression represents the definite integral of f of x from a to b, and its value is a real number representing the signed area under the curve of f of x between a and b."}
{"unnormalised": "There are two primary types of integrals: definite and indefinite. A definite integral, as mentioned above, has limits of integration (a and b), and its result is a numerical value representing the area under the curve between those limits. On the other hand, an indefinite integral does not have limits of integration, and its result is a family of functions, all of which have the same derivative. This family of functions is represented by the original function plus a constant of integration, denoted by 'C'. So, the indefinite integral of f(x) is written as ∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F(x) is a function such that F'(x) = f(x). Don't forget the \"+ C\" - it's a common mistake on exams!", "normalised": "there are two primary types of integrals: definite and indefinite. a definite integral, as mentioned above, has limits of integration (a and b), and its result is a numerical value representing the area under the curve between those limits. on the other hand, an indefinite integral does not have limits of integration, and its result is a family of functions, all of which have the same derivative. this family of functions is represented by the original function plus a constant of integration, denoted by 'c'. so, the indefinite integral of f of x is written as integral of f of x d x equals f of x plus c, where f of x is a function such that f prime of x equals f of x. don't forget the plus c - it's a common mistake on exams!"}
{"unnormalised": "Mastering integral calculus requires familiarity with several key techniques. One of the most basic is the power rule, which states that ∫xn dx = (xn+1)/(n+1) + C, provided n ≠ -1. For example, ∫x2 dx = (x3)/3 + C. Another important technique is integration by substitution, often used when dealing with composite functions. This involves substituting a part of the integrand with a new variable to simplify the integration. For instance, consider ∫2x * sqrt(1 + x^2) dx. Let u = 1 + x^2, then du = 2x dx. The integral then becomes ∫sqrt(u) du, which is much simpler to solve.", "normalised": "mastering integral calculus requires familiarity with several key techniques. one of the most basic is the power rule, which states that integral of x to the power of n d x equals x to the power of n plus one divided by n plus one plus c, provided n not equal to negative one. for example, integral of x squared d x equals x cubed divided by three plus c. another important technique is integration by substitution, often used when dealing with composite functions. this involves substituting a part of the integrand with a new variable to simplify the integration. for instance, consider integral of two x asterisk square root of one plus x squared d x. let u equals one plus x squared, then d u equals two x d x. the integral then becomes integral of square root of u d u, which is much simpler to solve."}
{"unnormalised": "Integration by parts is another vital tool, particularly useful for integrating products of functions. It is based on the product rule of differentiation and is expressed as ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. The key here is choosing u and dv strategically to simplify the integral. For example, consider ∫x * sin(x) dx. Here, let u = x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = -cos(x). Applying the formula, we get -x*cos(x) - ∫ -cos(x) dx = -x*cos(x) + sin(x) + C. These techniques, along with trigonometric substitutions and partial fraction decomposition, form the core of integral calculus.", "normalised": "integration by parts is another vital tool, particularly useful for integrating products of functions. it is based on the product rule of differentiation and is expressed as integral of u d v equals u v minus integral of v d u. the key here is choosing u and d v strategically to simplify the integral. for example, consider integral of x asterisk sine of x d x. here, let u equals x and d v equals sine of x d x. then, d u equals d x and v equals negative cosine of x. applying the formula, we get negative x asterisk cosine of x minus integral of negative cosine of x d x equals negative x asterisk cosine of x plus sine of x plus c. these techniques, along with trigonometric substitutions and partial fraction decomposition, form the core of integral calculus."}
{"unnormalised": "Applications of integral calculus are widespread and profound. In physics, integration is used to calculate the work done by a force, the center of mass of an object, and the total charge of a distributed charge density. In engineering, it is used to determine the volume of solids, the bending moment of beams, and the flow rate of fluids. In economics, it is used to calculate consumer surplus, producer surplus, and the present value of future income streams. Even in seemingly unrelated fields like probability and statistics, integral calculus plays a crucial role in calculating probabilities and expected values for continuous random variables. For example, the area under a probability density function (pdf) must equal 1, represented by the integral ∫-∞+∞ f(x) dx = 1 where f(x) is the pdf.", "normalised": "applications of integral calculus are widespread and profound. in physics, integration is used to calculate the work done by a force, the center of mass of an object, and the total charge of a distributed charge density. in engineering, it is used to determine the volume of solids, the bending moment of beams, and the flow rate of fluids. in economics, it is used to calculate consumer surplus, producer surplus, and the present value of future income streams. even in seemingly unrelated fields like probability and statistics, integral calculus plays a crucial role in calculating probabilities and expected values for continuous random variables. for example, the area under a probability density function (P-D-F) must equal one, represented by the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of f of x d x equals one where f of x is the P-D-F."}
