He demonstrated how you could approximate the total volume by summing up small rectangular areas under the flow rate curve. The smaller the rectangles, the better the approximation. He wrote out Σf(xi)Δx and explained how it relates to the integral sign ∫, a stretched-out 'S' for summation.", "normalised": "He then proceeded to explain the concept using a real-world analogy: calculating the amount of water collected in a reservoir over time, given a fluctuating rate of inflow.

Now, when I see a complex integral, I don't see a daunting obstacle; I see a challenge, a puzzle waiting to be solved, a story waiting to be told through the language of numbers.
