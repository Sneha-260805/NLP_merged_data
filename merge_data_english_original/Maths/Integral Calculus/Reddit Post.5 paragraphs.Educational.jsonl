{"unnormalised": "For example, if I have to evaluate ∫ sin(x) dx from 0 to π/2, I know the antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). But then what? Do I just do -cos(π/2) - (-cos(0))? I keep getting the wrong answers. My textbook only gives examples with simpler numbers. I’ve tried watching YouTube tutorials, but they aren’t really clicking for me. Also, how does this change if the integrand is something more complex, like e^(2x)?", "normalised": "For example, if I have to evaluate integral of sine of x d x from zero to pi divided by two, I know the antiderivative of sine of x is negative cosine of x.

{"unnormalised": "What's the general method to tackle these kinds of problems? Is there a trick to remember or a step-by-step procedure I should follow? Also, I keep getting confused between u-substitution and integration by parts. Is there a quick way to identify when I should use one versus the other? Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated. Maybe someone can walk me through an example or two with similar limits.", "normalised": "What's the general method to tackle these kinds of problems?

{"unnormalised": "Also, is there a difference when integrating from -π to π vs. 0 to π? I saw a problem like that where the solution just became 0. Is this some special rule for symmetric functions? The Prof. mentioned something about even and odd functions. Any links to websites or videos that explain the rules relating to this concept would be greatly appreciated.
