I mean, finding the area under a curve using limits... conceptually cool, but practically a headache, especially when Prof. Sharma gave us problems with stuff like ∫ from 0 to π/2 of sin(x) dx.

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, integration's not just some abstract exercise. Think about it - civil engineers use it to calculate the load a bridge can handle, like finding ∫ from 0 to L of w(x) dx, where w(x) is the distributed load and L is the bridge length. I remember reading about how they calculated the amount of concrete needed for the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, and that involved some serious integral calculus. Plus, even in economics, calculating consumer surplus uses similar concepts. It's all around us!", "normalised": "The thing is, integration's not just some abstract exercise.

You had to memorize all these tricks, like when to use the 'LIATE' rule (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential) for integration by parts.

{"unnormalised": "One cool application I found was in probability and statistics. Ever calculated the probability of a random variable falling within a certain range? That involves integrating the probability density function. Like, if you have a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the probability of x being between a and b is given by ∫ from a to b of f(x) dx, where f(x) is the normal distribution's probability density function. Pretty neat, huh?", "normalised": "One cool application I found was in probability and statistics. Ever calculated the probability of a random variable falling within a certain range?

{"unnormalised": "So, even though integral calculus felt like torture at times, it's actually a pretty useful tool. From civil engineering to finance to statistics, integration's all over the place. Maybe next time I see an integral, I won't groan quite so much... maybe.
