{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm stuck on definite integrals. Like, if I have to evaluate ∫ from 0 to 1 of (x^2 + 2x) dx, I can work out the antiderivative as x^3/3 + x^2, but then I mess up substituting the limits. I always seem to get the + and - signs wrong somehow, or forget to plug in '0' as the lower limit. Is there some foolproof method or trick to avoid such silly mistakes? Anyone else face similar problems? I feel like I'm the only one struggling this much. BTW, what does the integral from -1 to 1 (x^3) dx equal? It seems like 0, but I am not entirely sure...", "normalised": "Specifically, I'm stuck on definite integrals.

{"unnormalised": "Also, what about integrals involving trigonometric functions? For instance, evaluating ∫ cos(x) dx from 0 to π/2. I know the answer is supposed to be 1, but getting there consistently feels like a gamble. I remember someone telling me about u-substitution for solving more complicated integration problems, but the examples in my textbook are not that helpful. Any good online resources that you guys could suggest? Preferably something that explains it in simpler language. I'm finding the typical explanations in the textbooks a bit too formal and abstract, especially the ones involving limits and sums from n=1 to infinity for Riemann integration.", "normalised": "Also, what about integrals involving trigonometric functions?

{"unnormalised": "I’ve also heard there are some cool shortcuts for area problems, things like Pappu’s centroid theorem, but I’m not sure if they apply to all functions, or only to some special ones like circles, ellipses, and so on. Does anyone have experience applying such shortcuts during JEE? Are they risky to use because of possible conditions under which those theorems hold? Are they even worth knowing for someone who’s struggling with the basics?", "normalised": "I’ve also heard there are some cool shortcuts for area problems, things like Pappu’s centroid theorem, but I’m not sure if they apply to all functions, or only to some special ones like circles, ellipses, and so on.
