{"unnormalised": "First, I tried letting u = 1+x. Then du = dx and x = u - 1. So the integral becomes ∫(u-1)√u du = ∫(u^(3/2) - u^(1/2)) du. Integrating gives me (2/5)u^(5/2) - (2/3)u^(3/2) + C. Substituting back u = 1+x, I get (2/5)(1+x)^(5/2) - (2/3)(1+x)^(3/2) + C. Now evaluating from 0 to 3, I get [(2/5)(4)^(5/2) - (2/3)(4)^(3/2)] - [(2/5)(1)^(5/2) - (2/3)(1)^(3/2)] = [(2/5)*32 - (2/3)*8] - [(2/5) - (2/3)] = (64/5 - 16/3) - (2/5 - 2/3) = (192-80)/15 - (6-10)/15 = 112/15 + 4/15 = 116/15. But the answer in the back is 4/5. Kaha gadbad ho gaya?", "normalised": "First, I tried letting u equals one plus x. Then d u equals d x and x equals u minus one.

Integrating gives me two fifths u to the power of five divided by two minus two thirds u to the power of three divided by two plus C. Substituting back u equals one plus x, I get two fifths of quantity one plus x to the power of five divided by two minus two thirds of quantity one plus x to the power of three divided by two plus C.

{"unnormalised": "Then, I was like, okay maybe integration by parts will work. Let u= x and dv = √(1+x) dx. Then du = dx. To find v, I need to integrate √(1+x) dx which is the same as (1+x)^(1/2) dx. Using u-sub again, let w=1+x, dw=dx, ∫w^(1/2) dw = (2/3)w^(3/2) + C = (2/3)(1+x)^(3/2) + C. So, v=(2/3)(1+x)^(3/2).", "normalised": "Then, I was like, okay maybe integration by parts will work. Let u equals x and d v equals square root of one plus x d x. Then d u equals d x. To find v, I need to integrate square root of one plus x d x which is the same as quantity one plus x to the power of one divided by two d x. Using u-substitution again, let w equals one plus x, d w equals d x, integral of w to the power of one divided by two d w equals two thirds w to the power of three divided by two plus C equals two thirds of quantity one plus x to the power of three divided by two plus C. So, v equals two thirds of quantity one plus x to the power of three divided by two."}
{"unnormalised": "Using the formula ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, I have ∫x√(1+x) dx = x*(2/3)(1+x)^(3/2) - ∫(2/3)(1+x)^(3/2) dx. This gives me (2/3)x(1+x)^(3/2) - (2/3)∫(1+x)^(3/2) dx. Now, ∫(1+x)^(3/2) dx = (2/5)(1+x)^(5/2) + C. So, my expression is (2/3)x(1+x)^(3/2) - (2/3)*(2/5)(1+x)^(5/2) + C = (2/3)x(1+x)^(3/2) - (4/15)(1+x)^(5/2) + C. Evaluating from 0 to 3, I get [(2/3)*3*(4)^(3/2) - (4/15)*(4)^(5/2)] - [0 - (4/15)*(1)^(5/2)] = [(2/3)*3*8 - (4/15)*32] - [-(4/15)] = [16 - 128/15] + 4/15 = (240-128)/15 + 4/15 = 112/15 + 4/15 = 116/15.
