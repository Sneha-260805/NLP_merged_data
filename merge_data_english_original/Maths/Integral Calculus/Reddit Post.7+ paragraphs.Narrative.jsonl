{"unnormalised": "Then there was the whole u-substitution thing. I spent hours trying to figure out when to use it. Like, when is it obvious that you need to sub something? There was this one problem, ∫sin(x)cos(x) dx, that took me ages. I initially tried the power rule directly on sin(x)cos(x) and got absolutely nowhere. Finally, after like, 30 mins I realized subbing u = sin(x) would make my life so much easier. Like duh!. du = cos(x) dx. Then it's just ∫u du = (u^2)/2 + C. Substitute back and bam! (sin^2(x))/2 + C.", "normalised": "Then there was the whole u-substitution thing. I spent hours trying to figure out when to use it. Like, when is it obvious that you need to sub something?

{"unnormalised": "But wait, there's more! Trig integrals! Those were the absolute worst. I remember one particular problem, ∫tan(x) dx. Took me a solid hour to figure out. Turns out you rewrite it as ∫sin(x)/cos(x) dx, and then a clever substitution u = cos(x), du = -sin(x) dx. Then you have -∫1/u du = -ln|u| + C. Substitute back and we have -ln|cos(x)| + C.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on definite integrals! All those limits of integration! Like, you have ∫(from a to b) f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a). Easy enough in theory, but then you get problems with crazy numbers like ∫(from 0 to π/2) sin^2(x) dx, and suddenly, your brain just kinda melts.
