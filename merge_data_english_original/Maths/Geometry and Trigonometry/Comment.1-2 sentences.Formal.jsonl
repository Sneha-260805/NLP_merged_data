{"unnormalised": "Regarding the problem, the calculation of the triangle's area using Heron's formula, sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] where s=(a+b+c)/2 and sides are a=3cm, b=4cm, c=5cm, should yield 6 sq cm as the final result. Please double-check the inputs and the units.", "normalised": "Regarding the problem, the calculation of the triangle's area using Heron's formula, square root of s times s minus a times s minus b times s minus c where s equals a plus b plus c divided by two and sides are a equals three centimeter, b equals four centimeter, c equals five centimeter, should yield six square centimeter as the final result. Please double-check the inputs and the units."}
