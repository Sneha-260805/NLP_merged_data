It's like the mathematicians just wanted to make things as complicated as possible for the fun of it.

{"unnormalised": "So, fellow Redditors, I propose we start a petition to simplify geometry. More triangles with clear angles, less abstract concepts. Maybe just give us a cheat sheet for all the formulas and call it a day. Or, even better, replace geometry class with chai and samosa appreciation.
