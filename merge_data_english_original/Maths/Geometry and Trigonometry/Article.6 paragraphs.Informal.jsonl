Think about it – architects designing buildings, engineers building bridges, even artists creating cool stuff – they all use geometry, right? And trig? Well, that's just geometry's slightly more complicated cousin, dealing with triangles and sine, cosine, and all that jazz. But don't worry, it’s not as scary as your 10th grade maths teacher made it seem!", "normalised": "Geometry, yaar! It is not just some boring subject we all suffered through in school.

It's about developing a way of thinking, a way of seeing the world that can help you solve problems, create amazing things, and understand the world around you a little bit better. Plus, it impresses your friends when you casually mention something about angles of elevation, especially when you're overlooking that amazing view from a rooftop restaurant.
