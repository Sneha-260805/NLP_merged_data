{"unnormalised": "Geometry, at its core, deals with shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and the properties of space. From basic concepts like points, lines, and planes to more complex figures such as triangles, circles, and polyhedra, understanding the fundamental postulates and theorems is crucial. For example, the Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c², is not just a formula; it's a cornerstone of right-angled triangle geometry. Similarly, knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180° is essential for solving problems related to angle calculation and triangle properties.", "normalised": "Geometry, at its core, deals with shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and the properties of space. From basic concepts like points, lines, and planes to more complex figures such as triangles, circles, and polyhedra, understanding the fundamental postulates and theorems is crucial. For example, the Pythagorean theorem, a squared plus b squared equals c squared, is not just a formula; it's a cornerstone of right-angled triangle geometry. Similarly, knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is always one hundred and eighty degrees is essential for solving problems related to angle calculation and triangle properties."}
{"unnormalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, explores the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. The trigonometric ratios - sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) - are defined based on the ratios of these sides in a right-angled triangle. Sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse, Cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse, and Tan θ = Opposite/Adjacent are foundational. Understanding these ratios and their applications is vital for tackling problems involving heights, distances, and angles of elevation and depression. Remember, π radians = 180 degrees – a key conversion!", "normalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, explores the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles.

{"unnormalised": "The unit circle provides a visual representation of trigonometric functions and helps in understanding their behavior across different quadrants. It’s useful for remembering the signs of trigonometric functions in different quadrants (e.g., in quadrant II, sin is positive, cos is negative). Identities like sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 and tanθ = sinθ/cosθ are frequently used to simplify trigonometric expressions. Problems might involve values like sin 30°, cos 45°, or tan 60°, so memorizing these common values is helpful.", "normalised": "The unit circle provides a visual representation of trigonometric functions and helps in understanding their behavior across different quadrants.

{"unnormalised": "In competitive exams, questions often combine concepts from both Geometry and Trigonometry. For instance, a problem might involve calculating the area of a sector of a circle using trigonometric functions to find the angle of the sector. Or, it could require you to find the height of a tower given the angle of elevation from a certain point and the distance to the base of the tower. Visualizing the problem and drawing a clear diagram is often the first step to solving it.", "normalised": "In competitive exams, questions often combine concepts from both Geometry and Trigonometry.

{"unnormalised": "Mastering Geometry and Trigonometry requires consistent practice and a strong conceptual understanding. Work through examples, solve problems from different sources, and understand the logic behind each step. Use online resources, textbooks, and practice papers to hone your skills. A solid foundation in these topics not only helps in scoring well in competitive exams but also provides a valuable toolset for solving real-world problems. The CAT exam often features geometry questions requiring knowledge of formulas for areas and volumes of 2D and 3D shapes, with numerical calculations involving figures like 3 sides of 4cm, 5cm, 6cm respectively.", "normalised": "Mastering Geometry and Trigonometry requires consistent practice and a strong conceptual understanding.
