We can't measure the height directly, but we can measure the angle of elevation and the distance from the base.

We used a rudimentary clinometer he’d fashioned from a protractor and a straw to measure the angle of elevation – it was about 68 degrees. Plugging the values into tan(68 degrees) = height/72 m, we got a surprisingly accurate estimate of Qutub Minar's height.
