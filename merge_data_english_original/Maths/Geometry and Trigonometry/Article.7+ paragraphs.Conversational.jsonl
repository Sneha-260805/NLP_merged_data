The map itself is a 2D representation of a 3D world, using projections that rely on geometric principles. And when the GPS calculates the shortest route, it's using geometry and algorithms based on triangles to minimize the distance. The car's fuel efficiency, calculated at, say, 15 km/liter, impacts your trip planning, a further mathematical consideration.", "normalised": "Now, picture you're planning a road trip from Delhi to Jaipur.

{"unnormalised": "Ever wondered how architects design buildings? It's not just about artistic flair. They use geometry and trigonometry extensively to ensure structural integrity. For instance, calculating the angle of a roof to maximize sunlight or ensure proper drainage involves trigonometry. The precise dimensions of rooms – maybe a living room that's 4m x 5m – are crucial for space planning and furniture placement. Even the slope of a ramp for wheelchair access needs to adhere to specific angular guidelines, perhaps a gradient of 1/12 or approximately 4.76 degrees, ensuring accessibility for all.", "normalised": "Ever wondered how architects design buildings?

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s trigonometry. It might seem abstract, but it's essential in fields like surveying and navigation. Surveyors use trigonometry to measure distances and elevations, like figuring out the height of a mountain. Imagine someone trying to determine the height of Qutub Minar. Using a theodolite and some trig, they can find the angle of elevation to the top and, knowing the distance to the base, calculate the height – let’s say around 73m.", "normalised": "Then there’s trigonometry.

{"unnormalised": "Let's take a look at sports. Consider cricket. The trajectory of a ball hit by a batsman follows a parabolic path, a concept from geometry. Calculating the optimal angle to hit the ball for maximum distance relies on understanding trigonometric principles and projectile motion. The distance a fielder needs to cover to catch a ball can be calculated using geometry and velocity vectors. If a fielder is 20m away from where the ball is expected to land, they have to calculate if they can get there in time, considering their speed and the ball's trajectory.", "normalised": "Let's take a look at sports.
