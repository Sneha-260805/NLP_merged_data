Ever wondered how they got that level of accuracy? Trigonometry, my friends! Think about it - a sundial relies on the angle of the sun (θ) to tell time, and that angle changes throughout the day. You can use trigonometric functions like sin(θ), cos(θ), and tan(θ) to calculate the sun's altitude and azimuth at any given time!\" He emphasized 'tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent' with a flourish.", "normalised": "He continued, \"In Jaipur, during Jantar Mantar's construction back in one thousand seven hundred and thirty four A-D, Maharaja Jai Singh the Second meticulously calculated angles using massive sundials.
