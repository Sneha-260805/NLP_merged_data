Think back to your school days: remembering the basics of triangles, squares, circles, and other 2D and 3D shapes. Remember theorems like the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)? This fundamental concept forms the bedrock for understanding right-angled triangles and calculating distances.", "normalised": "Let's start with geometry, the study of shapes, sizes, positions, and properties of space.

Remember the formula for finding the area of a circle, i.e., πr^2, where 'π' is approximately 3.14159 and 'r' stands for radius? Understanding these seemingly basic concepts will help you grasp more complicated concepts later on. Even something like calculating the square footage of a plot (say, 1200 sq ft) involves geometrical concepts.", "normalised": "Concepts such as \"area\" and \"volume\" are geometrical in nature.

Sine, cosine, and tangent (often abbreviated as sin, cos, and tan) are the primary trigonometric ratios.
