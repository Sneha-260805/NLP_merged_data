{"unnormalised": "Okay, so let's be real. When we hear \"geometry\" and \"trigonometry,\" most of us probably flashback to endless hours spent in school, struggling with theorems and formulas. I remember Ms. Sharma trying to explain the Pythagorean theorem, something like a^2 + b^2 = c^2, but honestly, all I could think about was the new Bollywood movie releasing that Friday. But trust me, these aren't just things you need to memorize for the Class 10 board exams. They're actually pretty useful in real life, even if you don't realize it.", "normalised": "Okay, so let's be real.

{"unnormalised": "Think about it – geometry is all about shapes, sizes, and positions. Ever tried packing your suitcase efficiently? That's geometry, figuring out how to fit all those kurtas and sarees into a limited space. Or what about planning furniture placement in your room? You're subconsciously using geometric principles to make sure everything fits and looks good. Even something as simple as cutting a cake into equal slices involves geometry. Suddenly, that chapter you hated seems a little less pointless, no?", "normalised": "Think about it – geometry is all about shapes, sizes, and positions. Ever tried packing your suitcase efficiently?

{"unnormalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, deals with angles and triangles. Now, you might be thinking, \"When am I ever going to use sine, cosine, and tangent outside of a math class?\" Well, imagine you're planning a trip to the Himalayas. You want to know how high that peak is but can’t exactly climb to the top with a measuring tape. Trigonometry, using something like tan(angle) = height/distance, helps you estimate the height based on the angle of elevation and your distance from the mountain. Engineers and architects use trig principles every single day when designing structures.", "normalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, deals with angles and triangles.

{"unnormalised": "And let’s not forget the everyday uses of geometry. Say you’re planning to DIY your house with beautiful ceramic tiles. The first thing that comes to your mind would be how many tiles (of say, 10cm x 10cm) would be needed to tile an area of approximately 500 cm by 500 cm! Or maybe you are thinking about designing a beautiful geometric rangoli for Diwali. It all needs knowledge of angles, coordinates and areas.", "normalised": "And let’s not forget the everyday uses of geometry. Say you’re planning to D-I-Y your house with beautiful ceramic tiles.
