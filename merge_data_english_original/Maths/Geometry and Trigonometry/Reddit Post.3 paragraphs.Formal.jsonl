{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm having trouble with questions involving coordinate geometry and trigonometric identities. I can remember sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1, but when the problem involves multiple variables and requires manipulating the equation, I get completely lost. For example, one problem asked to find the area of a triangle with vertices at (1, 2), (4, 6), and (7, 3). I tried using the distance formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) but just ended up with a mess of numbers.", "normalised": "Specifically, I am having trouble with questions involving coordinate geometry and trigonometric identities.
