{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, folks. Maths, especially geometry and trigonometry, gets a bad rap. People think it's all about obtuse angles and sine waves, stuff drier than a week-old roti. But I'm here to tell you, it's actually more exciting than a cricket match between India and Pakistan. Really! Just think of all those triangles – each one hiding a secret angle, a special length, a hidden relationship. It’s like a family drama, only with fewer in-laws and more right angles. I mean, Pythagoras, the OG mathematician, basically gave us the ultimate shortcut for finding sides of right triangles: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Even I could remember that one after downing 3 cups of chai.", "normalised": "Let's be honest, folks. Maths, especially geometry and trigonometry, gets a bad rap.

{"unnormalised": "And trigonometry? Don’t even get me started! SOH CAH TOA – it sounds like some mystical incantation, doesn't it? Like something a babaji might use to predict the monsoon. But it's really just a handy mnemonic for remembering sine, cosine, and tangent. Imagine trying to build a bridge over the Ganga without knowing how to calculate angles of elevation! You’d end up with a bridge pointing straight into the water, and a whole lot of unhappy commuters. I read somewhere that ancient Indian mathematicians knew trigonometry way before the western world. Now, that’s a claim to fame, even better than starring in a Bollywood blockbuster!", "normalised": "And trigonometry? Don’t even get me started!

Whether it's the wheel of an auto-rickshaw or the perfectly round jalebi your mithaiwala crafts, geometry is at play. Imagine designing the Taj Mahal without understanding symmetry and proportions. It would look like a poorly drawn sketch on a napkin. The circumference of that circle, 2πr, basically decides how far a rickshaw travels in one rotation. Where would we be without that!", "normalised": "But truly, the real charm of geometry lies in its practical applications. Take, for instance, the humble circle.

{"unnormalised": "We cannot forget the humble π. It's approximately 3.14159, and it goes on and on forever! My maths teacher, Mr. Sharma, once told me that knowing π to a million digits is utterly useless. But he also said that knowing the capitals of all the countries in the world was useful, which I questioned given the speed at which countries change names. Either way, it's good to know that it allows us to accurately calculate perimeters and areas.", "normalised": "We cannot forget the humble pi.

Embrace the challenge, laugh at the occasional algebraic blunder, and perhaps you’ll even learn to appreciate the beauty and practicality of these mathematical masterpieces. After all, where else can you find such reliable formulas for solving real-world problems, with a dash of humour and a sprinkle of Bollywood drama thrown in for good measure? Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go ponder the intricacies of the Fibonacci sequence... or maybe just order some jalebis.", "normalised": "So, the next time you're feeling intimidated by geometry or trigonometry, just remember: it's not as scary as it seems.
