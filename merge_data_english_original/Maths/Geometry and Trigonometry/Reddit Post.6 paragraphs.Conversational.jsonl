{"unnormalised": "Edit: Guys, I finally got it! Used the area thing. Area = 1/2 * AB * BC = 1/2 * AC * BD. So, BD = (AB * BC) / AC = (8cm * 6cm) / 10cm = 4.8cm. Thanks to everyone who gave hints! Turns out I needed to calculate the total area of the right triangle with the two shorter sides and then calculate it using the hypotenuse. Feeling so much better now.", "normalised": "Edit: Guys, I finally got it! Used the area thing. Area equals one divided by two times A-B times B-C equals one divided by two times A-C times B-D. So, B-D equals A-B times B-C divided by A-C equals eight centimeter times six centimeter divided by ten centimeter equals four point eight centimeter. Thanks to everyone who gave hints!
