{"unnormalised": "Then there are those pesky circle theorems. You know, the ones where you have to figure out angles subtended by chords at the center, or the angles in the same segment? I can never remember which theorem to apply. Plus, they always add extra information in the diagram, things that I find confusing. This one question specifically is making me pull my hair out. It looks like this: A circle with center O and radius 5cm has a chord AB of length 8cm. Find the area of triangle OAB.", "normalised": "Then there are those pesky circle theorems.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on coordinate geometry! Finding the distance between two points is easy enough (thank you, Pythagoras!), but then they ask you to find the equation of a line passing through two points, or the area of a triangle given its vertices.
