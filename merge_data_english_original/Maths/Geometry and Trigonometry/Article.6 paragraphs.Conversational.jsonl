Builders in India, from ancient temples to modern skyscrapers, have used its principles to ensure stability. And those fancy digital screens everyone's glued to? Geometry is the unsung hero behind the pixel arrangements, ensuring you can watch your fav Bollywood movie in HD. I mean, even calculating the area of your drawing room uses geometry!

{"unnormalised": "Trigonometry, too, plays a significant role in our daily lives. Consider the angle of elevation of a kite. We can estimate the kite’s height using trigonometry without actually climbing up to measure it. Or imagine you are planning a bridge construction. Trigonometric calculations can help determine the optimal angles and lengths of support structures. Surveyors use trigonometry to map terrain, create accurate property lines, and ensure that infrastructure projects like roads and railways are correctly aligned.", "normalised": "Trigonometry, too, plays a significant role in our daily lives.

Think about the Taj Mahal, the chapati, the cricket ball, the rangoli. Geometry and trigonometry are not just abstract concepts; they're the hidden language of the universe. And with a little bit of effort, you can become fluent in it. Now, go and conquer those angles!
