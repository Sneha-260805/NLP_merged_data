{"unnormalised": "I remember when I was in class 10th and utterly confused by trigonometry. Sine, cosine, tangent… it was all Greek to me! Our maths teacher, Mr. Sharma, tried to explain it using right-angled triangles and formulas like sin θ = P/H, but I just couldn't grasp it. It felt like memorizing random symbols. Then, he showed us how to use trig in real life, like calculating the height of the Qutub Minar using angles and distances. Suddenly, it clicked! Now, even years later, I still remember those basic formulas, and I'm grateful to Mr. Sharma for patiently explaining the 30-60-90 triangle rule to me, again and again!", "normalised": "I remember when I was in class tenth and utterly confused by trigonometry.
