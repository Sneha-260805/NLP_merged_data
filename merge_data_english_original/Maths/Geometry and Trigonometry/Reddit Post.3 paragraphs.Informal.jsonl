{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some help with a geometry problem. My cousin's in class 10th and is prepping for his board exams. The question is: If the angle of elevation of a ladder leaning against a wall is 60 degrees, and the foot of the ladder is 4.6 m away from the wall, what is the length of the ladder? He's been struggling with it for like, 2 days now.", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some help with a geometry problem. My cousin's in class tenth and is prepping for his board exams.

{"unnormalised": "I remember doing these back in the day but am completely blanking out now. I think it involves some trig ratios like sin, cos, tan... maybe cos 60 = base/hypotenuse? So hypotenuse = base / cos 60. Cos 60 is 1/2 right? So 4.6 / (1/2) = 9.2 m? Is that even close to correct??", "normalised": "I remember doing these back in the day but am completely blanking out now. I think it involves some trig ratios like sine, cosine, tangent... maybe cosine sixty equals base divided by hypotenuse? So hypotenuse equals base divided by cosine sixty. Cosine sixty is one divided by two right? So four point six divided by one divided by two equals nine point two meters? Is that even close to correct?"}
{"unnormalised": "Also, is there an easy way to explain this to him so he doesn't feel totally lost? He's also got another one: sin θ = 3/5, find cos θ. Any quick tips would be appreciated! Thanks a bunch!", "normalised": "Also, is there an easy way to explain this to him so he doesn't feel totally lost?
