{"unnormalised": "Bro, I'm stuck on this geometry problem. The area of a triangle is given as 25 sq cm, and one side is 10 cm. What's the altitude to that side? I keep getting a different answer. Isn't the formula 1/2 * base * height? So, 0.5 * 10 * h = 25, which means h = 5 cm, right? Or am I missing something obvious? Pls help!", "normalised": "Bro, I am stuck on this geometry problem. The area of a triangle is given as twenty five square centimeter, and one side is ten centimeter. What is the altitude to that side? I keep getting a different answer. Is not the formula one divided by two times base times height? So, zero point five times ten times h equals twenty five, which means h equals five centimeter, right? Or am I missing something obvious? Please help!"}
