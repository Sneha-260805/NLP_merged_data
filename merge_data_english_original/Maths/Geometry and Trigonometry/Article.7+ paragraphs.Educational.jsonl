{"unnormalised": "Geometry, at its heart, is the study of shapes, sizes, and spatial relationships. We begin with basic elements like points, lines, and planes, building up to more complex figures such as triangles, circles, and polygons. Consider the simple act of calculating the area of a rectangular plot of land. If the plot measures 15m in length and 10m in width, its area is simply 15m * 10m = 150 sq m. This foundational concept is used in urban planning, agriculture, and construction. Understanding properties of circles is also crucial; the circumference of a circular park with a radius of 7m can be calculated as 2 * π * 7m, approximately 44m, helping us determine the length of fencing required.", "normalised": "Geometry, at its heart, is the study of shapes, sizes, and spatial relationships. We begin with basic elements like points, lines, and planes, building up to more complex figures such as triangles, circles, and polygons. Consider the simple act of calculating the area of a rectangular plot of land. If the plot measures fifteen meter in length and ten meter in width, its area is simply fifteen meter multiplied by ten meter equals one hundred and fifty square meter. This foundational concept is used in urban planning, agriculture, and construction. Understanding properties of circles is also crucial; the circumference of a circular park with a radius of seven meter can be calculated as two multiplied by pi multiplied by seven meter, approximately forty four meter, helping us determine the length of fencing required."}
{"unnormalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, delves into the relationships between angles and sides of triangles. The most commonly used functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions are particularly useful in right-angled triangles. Imagine you need to determine the height of Qutub Minar, but can't directly measure it. By measuring the angle of elevation from a certain point on the ground (say 30 degrees) and the distance from that point to the base of the monument (100m), you can use the tangent function: tan(30°) = height/100m. Given that tan(30°) is approximately 0.577, the height is roughly 0.577 * 100m = 57.7m.", "normalised": "Trigonometry, on the other hand, delves into the relationships between angles and sides of triangles. The most commonly used functions are sine (S-I-N), cosine (C-O-S), and tangent (T-A-N). These functions are particularly useful in right-angled triangles. Imagine you need to determine the height of Qutub Minar, but can't directly measure it. By measuring the angle of elevation from a certain point on the ground (say thirty degrees) and the distance from that point to the base of the monument (one hundred meter), you can use the tangent function: tangent of thirty degrees equals height divided by one hundred meter. Given that tangent of thirty degrees is approximately zero point five seven seven, the height is roughly zero point five seven seven multiplied by one hundred meter equals fifty seven point seven meter."}
{"unnormalised": "The interplay between geometry and trigonometry is vital in many applications. For example, in architecture, structural engineers use trigonometric principles to ensure the stability and safety of buildings. The angles and lengths of beams and supports are carefully calculated to distribute weight evenly and prevent collapse. Similarly, in navigation, ships and airplanes use trigonometry to determine their position and course. By measuring angles to known landmarks or stars, they can calculate their latitude and longitude, ensuring they reach their destination safely. Calculating trajectory of ISRO's PSLV rocket requires complex trigonometric calculations to ensure it reaches the geostationary orbit.", "normalised": "The interplay between geometry and trigonometry is vital in many applications.

{"unnormalised": "Consider the design of a simple ramp. To ensure it is accessible and safe, the angle of inclination must be within a certain range, often specified as less than 5 degrees. Using trigonometric ratios, one can determine the required length of the ramp for a given height difference. If the height difference is 1 meter, then the ramp needs to be 1/tan(5 degrees) meters long, roughly about 11.43m, according to my Casio fx-991ES PLUS calculator.", "normalised": "Consider the design of a simple ramp.
