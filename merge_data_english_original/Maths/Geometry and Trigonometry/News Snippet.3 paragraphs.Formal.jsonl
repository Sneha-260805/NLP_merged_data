{"unnormalised": "A recent study conducted by IIT Delhi has revealed a significant gap in the understanding of geometry and trigonometry concepts among students in grades 9-12 across several Indian states. The research, published on 10/11/2024, indicates that only 35% of students surveyed demonstrated a firm grasp of key principles such as Pythagoras theorem, trigonometric ratios, and coordinate geometry. This deficiency, researchers claim, could hinder their progress in advanced STEM fields.", "normalised": "A recent study conducted by I-I-T Delhi has revealed a significant gap in the understanding of geometry and trigonometry concepts among students in grades nine to twelve across several Indian states. The research, published on tenth november two thousand and twenty four, indicates that only thirty five percent of students surveyed demonstrated a firm grasp of key principles such as Pythagoras theorem, trigonometric ratios, and coordinate geometry. This deficiency, researchers claim, could hinder their progress in advanced S-T-E-M fields."}
{"unnormalised": "The study involved a sample size of 10,000 students from 500 schools across 10 states. Key findings highlight a common struggle with applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems, particularly in areas like calculating the area of a triangle or solving trigonometric equations. Experts suggest that the rote learning approach prevalent in many schools might be contributing to this issue. The average score across all tests was recorded at 48%, significantly below the desired benchmark.", "normalised": "The study involved a sample size of ten thousand students from five hundred schools across ten states. Key findings highlight a common struggle with applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems, particularly in areas like calculating the area of a triangle or solving trigonometric equations. Experts suggest that the rote learning approach prevalent in many schools might be contributing to this issue. The average score across all tests was recorded at forty eight percent, significantly below the desired benchmark."}

Sharma, lead researcher of the project, emphasizes the need for a revised curriculum and improved teaching methodologies. \"Focus should be shifted towards fostering conceptual clarity rather than memorization,\" he stated. He further added that the study has been presented to the Ministry of Education with recommendations for enhanced teacher training and the integration of interactive learning tools. A follow-up study to assess the impact of these interventions is planned for Q3 2025.", "normalised": "Doctor R. K.
