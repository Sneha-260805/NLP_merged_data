{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I'm stuck on this geometry problem, yaar. It's for my 10th standard maths exam, and I just can't wrap my head around it. The question says, \"A tower stands vertically on the bank of a canal. From a point on the other bank directly opposite the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 60°. From another point 20m away from this point on the line joining this point to the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30°. Find the height of the tower and the width of the canal.\" Like, seriously, what does that even mean?!", "normalised": "Okay, so I'm stuck on this geometry problem, friend.

{"unnormalised": "I've tried drawing the diagram like 5 times already, and I keep getting different triangles. I think I need to use tan θ = opposite/adjacent, but I’m not sure how to set up the equations properly. My teacher, Mr. Sharma, explained it in class, but I was too busy daydreaming about chai and samosas. Now I'm regretting it big time. Anyone have any tips or can walk me through this step-by-step? Maybe some simpler geometry explanations would help too.", "normalised": "I've tried drawing the diagram like five times already, and I keep getting different triangles.
