{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, prepping for my Maths exam and geometry/trigonometry is giving me a hard time. I'm especially struggling with problems involving finding the area of a circle given the radius in cms, or calculating angles using sin, cos, tan. Any tips or tricks you guys have learned to make these concepts easier to grasp? I've watched some Khan Academy videos but still feel a little lost. Maybe some real-world examples to make it more relatable?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, prepping for my Maths exam and geometry or trigonometry is giving me a hard time.

{"unnormalised": "One specific type of question I'm finding tough are the ones where you have to apply the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to find the missing side of a right-angled triangle. Also, remembering the trigonometric ratios like sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse is proving difficult! I saw a problem today: If a triangle has sides 3cm and 4cm, what is the length of the hypotenuse? Simple, but I keep making silly mistakes.", "normalised": "One specific type of question I am finding tough are the ones where you have to apply the Pythagorean theorem parentheses a squared plus b squared equals c squared parentheses to find the missing side of a right angled triangle.
