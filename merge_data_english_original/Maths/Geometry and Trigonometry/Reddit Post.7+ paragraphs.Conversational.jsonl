{"unnormalised": "So, I'm stuck on this one problem involving triangles. It says, in triangle ABC, angle B is 90 degrees, AB is 5cm, and BC is 12cm. What's the length of AC? My brain is screaming Pythagoras theorem, but I keep messing up the calculations. Keep getting some weird decimal points. My friend keeps saying 13cm but i am not sure.", "normalised": "So, I'm stuck on this one problem involving triangles.

{"unnormalised": "Also, how do you guys remember all those trig ratios? Sine, cosine, tangent... it's all a blur.

{"unnormalised": "And don't even get me started on radians! What's the point of measuring angles in radians anyway? Degrees seemed perfectly fine to me. Some problem wanted me to convert 45 degrees into radians. Another said what is the value of sine (pi/6). I was like huh? I tried to search it up on Google, but even the explanations there go over my head. I just ended up more confused.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on radians!
