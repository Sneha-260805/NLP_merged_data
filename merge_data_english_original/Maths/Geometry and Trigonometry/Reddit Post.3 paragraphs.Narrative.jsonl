{"unnormalised": "Okay, so my younger brother, Rohan, is having a tough time with his Class 10 Maths, especially geometry. He's got this problem about a right-angled triangle – ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. The problem says, if AB = 6 cm and BC = 8 cm, find the length of AC. I tried to explain it using Pythagoras theorem, AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2, but he's just not getting it.

Something about sin θ = Opposite side / Hypotenuse. Honestly, I barely passed that chapter. Rohan is saying he needs help with finding area of a circle too when it has a radius of like 7cm. He keeps getting confused whether to use 2πr or πr^2. He even asked if π is like 3.14 or 22/7.", "normalised": "I remember when I was his age, trigonometry was my nemesis.

I need to pre-pone my trip to Bangalore to help him before the exam. He’s scoring around 40% and needs to get above 75% at least. I think he needs a more practical approach, maybe relatable examples. Any suggestions are welcome!", "normalised": "Anyway, if anyone has any tips on making geometry and trigonometry less scary, please share! Maybe a good YouTube channel or an online resource.
