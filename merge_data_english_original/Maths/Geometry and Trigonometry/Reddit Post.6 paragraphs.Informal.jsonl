{"unnormalised": "The question involves finding the area of a triangle where I only know 2 sides and 1 angle: side a = 10 cm, side b = 15 cm, and angle C = 30 degrees. I know there’s some fancy formula involving sin, but I just can’t seem to remember it properly. All these trig identities are giving me a headache man.", "normalised": "The question involves finding the area of a triangle where I only know two sides and one angle: side a equals ten centimeter, side b equals fifteen centimeter, and angle C equals thirty degrees. I know there's some fancy formula involving sine, but I just can't seem to remember it properly. All these trig identities are giving me a headache man."}
{"unnormalised": "My textbook says something about Area = 1/2 * a * b * sin(C), but when I plug in the values, I get Area = 1/2 * 10 * 15 * sin(30). Sin(30) is 0.5, right? So that becomes Area = 1/2 * 10 * 15 * 0.5. And that gives me 37.5 cm^2. Is that correct? It just seems too easy!", "normalised": "My textbook says something about Area equals one divided by two multiplied by a multiplied by b multiplied by sine of C, but when I plug in the values, I get Area equals one divided by two multiplied by ten multiplied by fifteen multiplied by sine of thirty. Sine of thirty is zero point five, right? So that becomes Area equals one divided by two multiplied by ten multiplied by fifteen multiplied by zero point five. And that gives me thirty seven point five centimeter squared. Is that correct? It just seems too easy!"}
{"unnormalised": "Also, the second part of the question asks for the length of the third side, side c. I think I need to use the cosine rule for that, which is c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C). So that would be c^2 = 10^2 + 15^2 - 2*10*15*cos(30). cos(30) is like, root 3 by 2, which is about 0.866, right? So it becomes c^2 = 100 + 225 - 300*0.866.", "normalised": "Also, the second part of the question asks for the length of the third side, side c. I think I need to use the cosine rule for that, which is c squared equals a squared plus b squared minus two a b multiplied by cosine of C. So that would be c squared equals ten squared plus fifteen squared minus two multiplied by ten multiplied by fifteen multiplied by cosine of thirty. Cosine of thirty is like, square root of three divided by two, which is about zero point eight six six, right? So it becomes c squared equals one hundred plus two hundred and twenty five minus three hundred multiplied by zero point eight six six."}
{"unnormalised": "After calculating, I got c^2 = 65.2. So c = sqrt(65.2) which is about 8.07 cm. Does that sound right to anyone? I'm just worried I’ve made some silly mistake somewhere. Professor Sharma is super strict about showing all the steps clearly and being accurate to at least 2 decimal places.", "normalised": "After calculating, I got c squared equals sixty five point two. So c equals square root of sixty five point two which is about eight point zero seven centimeter. Does that sound right to anyone? I'm just worried I've made some silly mistake somewhere.
