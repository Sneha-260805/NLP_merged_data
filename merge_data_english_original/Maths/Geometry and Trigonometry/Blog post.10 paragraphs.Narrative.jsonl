{"unnormalised": "Our first lesson was on triangles. Nana, with his characteristic twinkle in his eye, started by drawing a triangle ABC on a large sheet of paper. He explained that the sum of the angles was always 180 degrees. To illustrate, he cleverly used a samosa (that quintessential Indian snack!), cutting it into triangular pieces and demonstrating how they fit together to form a straight line. I instantly grasped the concept, forever associating the angle sum property with a delicious samosa.", "normalised": "Our first lesson was on triangles.

{"unnormalised": "Trigonometry, with its sines, cosines, and tangents, seemed daunting at first. I clearly recall him saying something like \"sin(90°) equals 1\", which I found strange at the time. But Nana patiently explained it using a simple, hand-drawn unit circle. He connected trigonometry to the movement of planets, the arc of a cricket ball, and the design of bridges. He showed me how trigonometry was used by surveyors to map the Himalayas, and by architects to design the Taj Mahal, explaining the importance of a 30-60-90 degree angle in architecture.", "normalised": "Trigonometry, with its sines, cosines, and tangents, seemed daunting at first.
