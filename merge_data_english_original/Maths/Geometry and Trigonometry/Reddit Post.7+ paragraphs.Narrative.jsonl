{"unnormalised": "It all started when Mrs. Desai was drawing a complicated diagram. There was this huge circle, and inside that, a triangle, and inside THAT, another smaller circle. She was explaining inscribed angles and how to calculate their values using some formula involving pi (π) which I always forget. The whole thing looked like one of those super complicated rangoli designs my mom makes for Diwali, only with less colour and way more confusing angles. I swear the inner circle was at a diameter of 2cm.", "normalised": "It all started when Missus Desai was drawing a complicated diagram.

Now, I knew the formula was something like 1/2 * base * height, but finding those values in this mess of lines was impossible for me.

{"unnormalised": "Then, Priya Sharma, the class genius, raises her hand and starts rattling off some trigonometric functions – sine, cosine, tangent – stuff I only vaguely remember from the previous chapter. She somehow figures out the length of one side of the triangle using the sine rule, and then…get this…she uses the 60-degree angle to calculate the other sides. The entire calculation involved sq root 3 somewhere.", "normalised": "Then, Priya Sharma, the class genius, raises her hand and starts rattling off some trigonometric functions – sine, cosine, tangent – stuff I only vaguely remember from the previous chapter.

{"unnormalised": "I'm sitting there, completely lost, trying to follow along in my notebook. I kept writing the wrong formulas. I even wrote “adjacent/hypotenuse” when I should have written “opposite/hypotenuse” for sine at one point. My brain just couldn't process it. Meanwhile, Mrs. Desai is nodding approvingly, and Priya is explaining how she got the answer to 25.98 cm².", "normalised": "I'm sitting there, completely lost, trying to follow along in my notebook.
