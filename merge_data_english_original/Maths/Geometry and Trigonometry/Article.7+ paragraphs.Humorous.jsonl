{"unnormalised": "Let's be honest, geometry was never about finding the area of a garden in acres, was it? It was about proving that *someone*, somewhere, knew what they were doing when they invented these ridiculous rules. \"Angles on a straight line add up to 180°\"? Okay, Einstein. Tell me something I *don't* already feel when I'm stuck in Mumbai traffic. Give me a number that matters: How many auto-rickshaws can fit on the Western Express Highway at 5:30 PM? That's the real geometry problem we need to solve, folks.", "normalised": "Let's be honest, geometry was never about finding the area of a garden in acres, was it?

{"unnormalised": "And trigonometry? Oh, don't even get me started. SOH CAH TOA. Sounds like some ancient mantra chanted by long-haired rishis in the Himalayas. Except, instead of enlightenment, it gives you... the ability to calculate the height of a tree using its shadow? Yeah, okay. My phone has a built-in measurement tool, thanks.
