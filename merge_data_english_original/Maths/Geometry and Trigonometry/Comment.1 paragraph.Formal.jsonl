{"unnormalised": "Regarding the query on the area of a triangle, using Heron's formula, given sides a=3cm, b=4cm & c=5cm, the semi-perimeter 's' is (3+4+5)/2 = 6cm. Therefore, the area equals sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = sqrt(6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)) = sqrt(6*3*2*1) = sqrt(36) = 6 sq. cm. Trigonometry can also be applied, but this method is generally simpler for known side lengths. Verify the calculations for accuracy before application.", "normalised": "Regarding the query on the area of a triangle, using Heron's formula, given sides a equals three centimeter, b equals four centimeter and c equals five centimeter, the semi-perimeter 's' is three plus four plus five divided by two equals six centimeter. Therefore, the area equals square root of s multiplied by s minus a multiplied by s minus b multiplied by s minus c equals square root of six multiplied by six minus three multiplied by six minus four multiplied by six minus five equals square root of six times three times two times one equals square root of thirty six equals six square centimeter.
