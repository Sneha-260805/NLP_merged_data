My maths teacher, Mr. Sharma, keeps saying it's fundamental but I'm not seeing it yet. Anyone got real-world examples, especially related to India? Maybe something involving building a flyover or figuring out the angle of a saree drape (okay, maybe that's a stretch haha)?", "normalised": "Seriously though, I am struggling with understanding the applications.

{"unnormalised": "Also, trig identities! Argh! Proving those identities feels like trying to solve a Bollywood plot – way too many twists and turns! Is there a trick to recognizing which identity to use when? I saw a problem where they needed to find cos(2 theta) and they gave only sin(theta) = 0.6. My friend solved it by drawing a right triangle, but is there a more general formula based approach?", "normalised": "Also, trigonometry identities! Argh!

Let me know if you have other questions regarding 3-D geometry, i'd be glad to discuss them.
