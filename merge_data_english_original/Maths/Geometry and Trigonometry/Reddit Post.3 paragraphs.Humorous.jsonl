{"unnormalised": "Okay folks, lemme tell you about my tryst with geometry, specifically triangles. Back in school, trying to figure out if those lines *actually* met at a *perfect* 90 degrees felt like more of a divine intervention than actual maths. My protractor was probably off by, like, 5 degrees anyway. Ms. Sharma kept saying \"Pythagoras theorem is your friend!\" but all I saw was a bunch of a^2 + b^2 = c^2 gibberish that wouldn’t even get me chai.

I mean, trying to memorize all those angles and ratios... it's like trying to remember all the dialogues from a Salman Khan movie – pointless after the first watch, but mandatory for survival.

I use it to figure out the best angle to watch cricket on my TV. Life's unfair, innit? Now if you'll excuse me, I have to calculate the hypotenuse of my samosa so I can maximize my dipping efficiency.", "normalised": "Now, years later, I see architects happily building things, and I'm pretty sure they're using this stuff.
