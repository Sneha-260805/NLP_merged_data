Rohan, taking a deep breath, finally spotted his: RV23479. Beside it, a number: 88/100. A wave of relief washed over him. He’d passed, and with a decent score, at that!

{"unnormalised": "Later that day, a heated discussion erupted on the IIT Bombay online forum. Some argued that the rigorous testing was necessary to prepare them for real-world engineering challenges, while others felt it was unnecessarily stressful. A comment thread with over 200 responses debated whether the exam accurately assessed their understanding of differential calculus or simply tested their ability to perform under pressure. One particularly vocal student suggested a re-evaluation, pointing out that the std dev for the scores was unusually high.", "normalised": "Later that day, a heated discussion erupted on the I-I-T Bombay online forum.
