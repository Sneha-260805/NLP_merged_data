{"unnormalised": "Basically, it's all about finding the rate of change of something. Imagine you’re walking on a curve. Differential calculus helps you find the slope of that curve at a specific point. We call this the derivative. It’s like taking a really, really close-up look at the curve until it looks like a straight line. Mind-blowing, right?", "normalised": "Basically, it's all about finding the rate of change of something. Imagine you're walking on a curve.

{"unnormalised": "Now, you might be wondering, \"Okay, so how do I actually *do* this?\" Well, there are a bunch of rules and formulas. For example, the derivative of x^2 is 2x. Don't worry if that sounds like gibberish. We'll get there. Remember those annoying limit problems you did earlier? Turns out, they're super important here. We use limits to define the derivative.

{"unnormalised": "Let's talk about applications. Imagine you’re designing a bridge. You need to know how much stress it can handle. Differential calculus can help you calculate the maximum and minimum stresses on the bridge, making sure it doesn’t collapse. Or consider optimising a factory’s production line. By using calculus, you can figure out how to produce the most goods with the least amount of resources. Isn't that cool?", "normalised": "Let's talk about applications.
