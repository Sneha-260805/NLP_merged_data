{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're struggling with differential calculus? Don't worry, even the best of us have been there! Think of it this way: it's all about figuring out how quickly something is changing. Like, imagine you're speeding down the Mumbai-Pune expressway. Your car's speedometer tells you how fast you're going *right now* – that's kind of like a derivative at a single point. Calculus basically lets you calculate this \"instantaneous\" speed, even if it's constantly changing. Cool, right?", "normalised": "Okay, so you're struggling with differential calculus?

{"unnormalised": "Differential calculus, at its core, revolves around finding derivatives. Remember that dy/dx thing from school? That’s essentially the ‘rate of change of y with respect to x.’ Think about it like this: if ‘y’ represents the distance you've travelled and ‘x’ represents the time, then dy/dx is your speed! Even if the distance 'y' changes in a complicated way, calculus gives you the tools to figure out the speed at any single moment in time, say x = 2.5 seconds.", "normalised": "Differential calculus, at its core, revolves around finding derivatives.

{"unnormalised": "Now, there are these rules, of course. Power rule, product rule, chain rule... sounds scary, but they are just shortcuts. The power rule says d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1). See? Not that bad. Then there is the chain rule, d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x), which handles composite functions - functions *inside* of other functions. Mastering these rules is key to acing those IIT-JEE problems.", "normalised": "Now, there are these rules, of course.

{"unnormalised": "Where does this actually get used? Everywhere! Engineers use it to design bridges and buildings. Economists use it to predict market trends. Even doctors use it to model the spread of diseases. Remember those graphs of COVID cases going up and down? Calculus was behind a lot of those predictions. It also finds use in machine learning algorithms where gradients are optimized using differential calculus techniques to minimize errors in the model.", "normalised": "Where does this actually get used?

{"unnormalised": "So, how do you get good at it? Practice, practice, practice! Start with the basic formulas and then work your way up to the harder problems. Solve all the exercises in your RD Sharma textbook. And don't be afraid to ask for help from your teachers or classmates. Maybe form a study group and tackle those tough problems together.
