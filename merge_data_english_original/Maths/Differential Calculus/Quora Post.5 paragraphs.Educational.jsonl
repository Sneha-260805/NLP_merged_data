{"unnormalised": "Let's say you have a function, y = f(x). The derivative, often written as dy/dx or f'(x), tells you how much y changes for a tiny, tiny change in x. Imagine x is time and y is your distance. dy/dx would be your speed at that instant! It's NOT the average speed; it's the instantaneous speed. Think of slope of the tangent line to the curve y=f(x) at a given point (x, f(x)).", "normalised": "Let's say you have a function, y equals f of x.

Another important rule involves trigonometric functions. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). Then, of course, we have the product rule and quotient rule which deal with differentiating the product and quotient of two functions u(x) and v(x). The product rule gives (uv)' = u'v + uv' and the quotient rule gives (u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v^2. These rules are crucial and you can find many problems with solutions online.", "normalised": "Now, there are some basic rules to learn. The power rule is key: if y equals x to the power of n, then d y divided by d x equals n times x to the power of n minus one. For instance, if y equals x squared, then d y divided by d x equals two x. Another important rule involves trigonometric functions. The derivative of sine of x is cosine of x, and the derivative of cosine of x is minus sine of x. Then, of course, we have the product rule and quotient rule which deal with differentiating the product and quotient of two functions u of x and v of x. The product rule gives u v prime equals u prime v plus u v prime and the quotient rule gives u divided by v prime equals u prime v minus u v prime divided by v squared. These rules are crucial and you can find many problems with solutions online."}

In engineering, it helps design structures. For example, if the area A of a circle changes with the radius r, so A=πr^2 , then dA/dr = 2πr. So, if r = 5 cm, dA/dr = 10π cm^2/cm. It can be very helpful for optimization problems, like the minimization of production cost.", "normalised": "Differential calculus is used everywhere.
