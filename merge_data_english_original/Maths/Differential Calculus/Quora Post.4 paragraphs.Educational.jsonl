We are trying to find out an instant rate of change.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about differential calculus, eh? It is actually super useful, even if it seems abstract.

{"unnormalised": "For example, imagine you have a function like y = x^2 + 3x - 10. Now you wanna find the slope of the tangent at x = 2. You'd first find the derivative (dy/dx), which comes out to be 2x + 3. And then substitute x=2, so the slope comes to 7. Simple! Isn't it? Similarly we can have higher order derivatives like d^2y/dx^2.", "normalised": "For example, imagine you have a function like y equals x squared plus three x minus ten. Now you want to find the slope of the tangent at x equals two. You would first find the derivative d y divided by d x, which comes out to be two x plus three. And then substitute x equals two, so the slope comes to seven. Simple! Is not it? Similarly, we can have higher order derivatives like d squared y divided by d x squared."}
{"unnormalised": "It's used all over the place. Physics guys use it to figure out velocity (rate of change of distance, s=ut+1/2at^2) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity) of objects. Economists use it to maximize profits. Engineers use it to optimize designs. Even weather forecasting models rely on differential equations, which are based on derivatives. You even use it indirectly every time you see a smoothly rendered 3D model on your computer - algorithms using derivatives are involved in calculating how light bounces off the surfaces.", "normalised": "It is used all over the place.

You might not see the direct applications right away, but once you start digging deeper into maths and science (and even some areas of business and tech), you'll be saying, \"Arre wah! I get it now!\". You should definitely consider solving all the NCERT problems to start. They start from the basics, and make sure your basics are strong. All the best!", "normalised": "Trust me, learning differential calculus is an investment.
