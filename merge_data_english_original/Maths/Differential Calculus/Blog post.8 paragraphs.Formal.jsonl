{"unnormalised": "At its core, differential calculus is concerned with the concept of the derivative. The derivative of a function at a particular point represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point. This rate of change is geometrically interpreted as the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at the specified point. Formally, the derivative of a function *f(x)* is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as *h* approaches 0: *f'(x) = lim (h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h*. This definition captures the essence of approximating the tangent line using secant lines that become increasingly closer to the point of tangency.", "normalised": "At its core, differential calculus is concerned with the concept of the derivative.

{"unnormalised": "The process of finding the derivative of a function is termed differentiation. Various techniques and rules simplify the differentiation process for different types of functions. The power rule, for example, states that the derivative of *x^n* is *n* *x^(n-1)*. Similarly, the product rule enables differentiation of the product of two functions: *d/dx [u(x)v(x)] = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)*. Understanding and mastering these rules is crucial for efficiently and accurately differentiating complex functions.", "normalised": "The process of finding the derivative of a function is termed differentiation.

{"unnormalised": "Applications of differential calculus are plentiful. One of the most common is optimization. By finding the critical points of a function, where the derivative is equal to 0 or undefined, we can identify local maxima and minima. This technique is widely used in engineering to design structures that minimize material usage while maximizing strength. For instance, consider a bridge design problem. Using differential calculus, one can determine the optimal dimensions of the supporting beams to minimize the overall weight of the bridge, subject to constraints on its load-bearing capacity, given as say, *L = 50000 kgs*.", "normalised": "Applications of differential calculus are plentiful.

The second derivative, for instance, provides information about the concavity of a function. A positive second derivative indicates that the function is concave up, while a negative second derivative signifies concavity down. Inflection points, where the concavity changes, occur where the second derivative is equal to 0 or undefined.
