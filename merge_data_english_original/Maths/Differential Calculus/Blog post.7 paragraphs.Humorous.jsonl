{"unnormalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about something that sends shivers down my spine – and no, it's not my mother-in-law's cooking (love you, aunty!). It’s Differential Calculus. Yes, that monster with the fancy \"d/dx\" and the \"limits\" that seem to stretch to infinity... or is it zero? I always forget. Honestly, sometimes I feel like a chai wala trying to understand quantum physics.", "normalised": "Okay, folks, let's talk about something that sends shivers down my spine – and no, it's not my mother-in-law's cooking (love you, aunty!).

{"unnormalised": "Remember that first moment you were introduced to derivatives? Mine was in class 11th, and it felt like my brain was being forced to run Windows XP in the age of AI. Suddenly, I had to find the \"instantaneous rate of change,\" which sounds way more exciting than it actually is. Turns out, it’s just drawing tangents to curves, which is less rock-and-roll and more geometry textbook.", "normalised": "Remember that first moment you were introduced to derivatives?

{"unnormalised": "Now, I'm not saying calculus is useless. I hear engineers use it to build bridges that don't collapse (that’s good!). And physicists use it to understand...well, everything (or so they claim). But for a simple soul like me, trying to wrap my head around chain rule and product rule feels like attempting to fold a samosa into the shape of a dodecahedron. Seriously, who came up with these rules anyway? Were they bored mathematicians sitting around drinking too much filter coffee?", "normalised": "Now, I'm not saying calculus is useless.

{"unnormalised": "The worst part? The exams. You cram all night, fuelled by instant noodles and the desperate hope of not failing. Then you sit down, look at the problems, and realize you've forgotten everything except how to spell \"differentiate.\" Suddenly, that \"easy\" question involving a function like f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7 transforms into an insurmountable Everest. The invigilator’s cough seems louder. Your pen seems heavier. It's a true existential crisis, only with more quadratic equations.", "normalised": "The worst part? The exams.

{"unnormalised": "But here's the silver lining (yes, there's one!). Calculus teaches you persistence. You keep banging your head against the wall until something (hopefully not your skull) cracks. And maybe, just maybe, you understand a tiny bit more than you did before.

{"unnormalised": "So, to all my fellow calculus sufferers out there, remember: you're not alone. We're all in this together, fumbling our way through limits, derivatives, and integrals. And who knows, maybe one day we'll actually understand what we're doing. Or maybe we'll just become professional complainers. Either way, cheers to surviving calculus! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with a textbook and a strong cup of chai to figure out the value of ∫(e^x)dx from 0 to 1. Wish me luck, I’ll probably need it!", "normalised": "So, to all my fellow calculus sufferers out there, remember: you're not alone.
