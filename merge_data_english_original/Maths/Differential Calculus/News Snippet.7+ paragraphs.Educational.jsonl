{"unnormalised": "The research paper describes a novel approach for estimating dy/dx given y = f(x). The estimated derivative is then used for further calculations with significantly reduced complexity. One key element of this simplification involves converting integrals to summations. Dr. Kumar illustrated this with the example of using summation from n=1 to 1000 instead of complex integral calculations, effectively trading precision for speed when absolute accuracy isn't critical.", "normalised": "The research paper describes a novel approach for estimating d y divided by d x given y equals f of x.
