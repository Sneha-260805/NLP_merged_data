{"unnormalised": "The basics, the real OG stuff, involves limits. A limit is basically what happens to a function (think of a function like a recipe in maths) as you get incredibly close to a certain number. We write it like lim x->2 f(x). Let's say f(x) = x + 1. As x gets closer and closer to 2, f(x) gets closer and closer to 3. That's the limit! Simple.", "normalised": "The basics, the real O-G stuff, involves limits. A limit is basically what happens to a function (think of a function like a recipe in maths) as you get incredibly close to a certain number. We write it like limit x tends to two f of x. Let's say f of x equals x plus one. As x gets closer and closer to two, f of x gets closer and closer to three. That's the limit! Simple."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the derivative, the big daddy of differential calculus. It's the rate of change of a function. Basically, it tells you how much the output of a function changes when you change the input by a tiny, tiny bit. Like, ridiculously tiny. The formula? f'(x) = lim h->0 [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h. Looks scary, I know. But trust me, it's just the slope of a line that's practically touching the curve at a single point.", "normalised": "Then there's the derivative, the big daddy of differential calculus.
