The distance covered (y) is a function of time (x). The derivative, dy/dx, then tells us the car's speed at that precise moment. Similarly, the slope of a curve at a single point is another manifestation of a derivative; it’s the tangent line’s slope at x=2, for instance.", "normalised": "think of it this way: imagine a car traveling along a road. its speed at any given instant can be calculated using differential calculus. the distance covered (y) is a function of time (x). the derivative, d y divided by d x, then tells us the car's speed at that precise moment. similarly, the slope of a curve at a single point is another manifestation of a derivative; it’s the tangent line’s slope at x equals two, for instance."}
