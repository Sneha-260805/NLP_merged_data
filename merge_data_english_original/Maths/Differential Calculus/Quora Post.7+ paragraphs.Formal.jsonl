Gradient descent, a widely used optimization algorithm, relies heavily on finding the minimum of a cost function.

He can use differential calculus to determine the optimal amount of fertilizer to apply. If he applies too little fertilizer, the yield will be low. If he applies too much, the yield may also decrease due to over-fertilization or nutrient toxicity.
