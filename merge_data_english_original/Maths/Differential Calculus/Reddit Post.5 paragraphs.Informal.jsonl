{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm stuck on this one problem: Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2. I know the power rule, but applying it feels like trying to solve a Sudoku blindfolded. The answer, according to my textbook, is 6x + 5, but I can’t seem to figure out *how* they got there! Is there some shortcut I'm missing, or am I just being dense? Should I just give up and switch to humanities?", "normalised": "Specifically, I am stuck on this one problem: Find the derivative of f of x equals three x squared plus five x minus two.
