{"unnormalised": "So, you've heard of differential calculus, huh? Probably from some IIT-JEE topper showing off about finding the instantaneous rate of change of his chai consumption with respect to stress levels during exams. Fear not, mere mortal! It's not *just* for them. Though, let’s be honest, they’re probably better at it. We will try to break it down, even if the only thing differentiating for you is deciding between samosas and vada pav for your 4 PM snack.", "normalised": "So, you've heard of differential calculus, huh?

{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: you’re stuck in Delhi traffic. The speedometer flicks between 0 km/h and 20 km/h every few seconds. Differential calculus is like having a magical dashboard that tells you *exactly* how fast your speed is changing at any given instant, even if it’s just 0.0001 seconds. It is kind of like asking, \"What's the slope of the tangent line at x = 3.14159?\" Your auto-rickshaw wala might not appreciate this, but trust me, engineers who design safer auto-rickshaws will. The concept might seem abstract like 2+2i but it is very applicable!", "normalised": "Think of it like this: you’re stuck in Delhi traffic.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk formulas. You’ve probably seen something like dy/dx = lim (h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h. Don't run away screaming! Imagine you're at a wedding, eating delicious biryani. 'y' is the amount of biryani you consume, and 'x' is the time you spend near the buffet. dy/dx is how quickly you’re stuffing your face! If dy/dx is high, it means you're a biryani-eating machine!

{"unnormalised": "But why bother learning this at all? Well, besides impressing your relatives at the next family gathering (which they probably won’t understand anyway), differential calculus is used everywhere. From designing bridges that don’t collapse (important!) to predicting the stock market (good luck!), to optimizing ad campaigns on YouTube (annoying but effective!), it is used everywhere. Even your favorite online shopping site uses it to figure out the best price for that saree you’ve been eyeing (the one you judged at the wedding!).", "normalised": "But why bother learning this at all?

And remember, even if you can't solve complex differential equations, you can always appreciate the magic of calculus silently, while enjoying a nice cup of chai at 6 PM. Maybe even try to calculate the rate of change of your chai temperature with respect to the ambient air temperature.
