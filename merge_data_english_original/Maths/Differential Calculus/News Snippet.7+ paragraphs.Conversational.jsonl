Students say they knew the theory, but applying it under exam pressure was a different story. Some are even thinking of retaking the exam in Nov/Dec to improve their scores! The minimum grade to get into IIT Delhi is 90% so it is important to get the right score.", "normalised": "One particularly tricky question involved optimizing the dimensions of a container given a constraint on its surface area.
