{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about learning differential calculus, right? It's not as scary as it looks, bhai! Think of it like this: you're riding your Bajaj scooter, and you want to know how fast your speed is changing *right now*. That's differential calculus in a nutshell – finding the *instantaneous* rate of change. You'll start with the basics like limits and derivatives of simple functions like x^2 or sin(x). Don't skip these; they are super important.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about learning differential calculus, right? It's not as scary as it looks, bhai!

For example, d/dx (sin(x^3)) needs the chain rule. Also, you’ll have to understand application of derivatives for maxima & minima calculations. These involve a lot of real-world application type problems, e.g., finding optimal dimensions for a box to maximize volume.", "normalised": "Then you move on to more complex functions and rules, like the chain rule.

{"unnormalised": "And don’t forget integration to undo differentiation. So, if differentiation is like finding the slope, integration is like finding the area under the curve. Good luck, and don't get bogged down if you hit a wall. Maths can be tough, but it's also super rewarding when you finally \"get\" it. And yeah, remember the d/dx (c) is equal to 0, where 'c' is any constant! 😉", "normalised": "And don’t forget integration to undo differentiation.
