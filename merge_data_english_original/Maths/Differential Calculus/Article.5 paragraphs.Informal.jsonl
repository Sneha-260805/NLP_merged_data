{"unnormalised": "Let's say Priya is cycling uphill. Her speed isn't constant, right? Sometimes she's pedaling hard, sometimes she's slowing down 'cause the incline's a pain. Differential calculus helps us figure out her exact speed at, say, 2:30 PM on 10/10/2024, at a specific point on that hill. This \"instantaneous rate of change\" is the core idea. It's denoted by things like dy/dx. Sounds scary, but it's just fancy notation for \"change in y over change in x\" when the change in x is super small – almost zero!", "normalised": "Let's say Priya is cycling uphill.

{"unnormalised": "Now, think about a business scenario. Suppose a company, say \"Sharma Electronics,\" is selling smartphones. They want to know how their profit changes when they produce 1 more phone. This is called \"marginal profit.\" Differential calculus provides tools, like derivatives, to find that marginal profit precisely. They can calculate how many extra rupees they'll make if they increase production by, say, 100 units. The formula might look like dP/dQ where P is profit and Q is quantity.", "normalised": "Now, think about a business scenario. Suppose a company, say \"Sharma Electronics,\" is selling smartphones.

{"unnormalised": "Derivatives are the main tool used. If we have a function like f(x) = x^2 + 3x, its derivative, denoted as f'(x), tells us the rate of change of that function. In this case, f'(x) = 2x + 3. Now, if x = 5, then f'(5) = 13. This means that at x = 5, the function is changing at a rate of 13. It is also important to know that there are different ways to find derivatives. Remember those rules from school? Product rule, quotient rule, chain rule. Important stuff, but once you know the underlying idea, it's really just applying them.", "normalised": "Derivatives are the main tool used. If we have a function like f of x equals x squared plus three x, its derivative, denoted as f prime of x, tells us the rate of change of that function. In this case, f prime of x equals two x plus three. Now, if x equals five, then f prime of five equals thirteen. This means that at x equals five, the function is changing at a rate of thirteen.

Remember Priya on her bike, Sharma Electronics’ profits, and think about how these concepts connect to the real world. Its used in every field like finding the trajectory of a missile or predicting weather patterns, and you will find that differential calculus is actually pretty useful and interesting even if your teacher uses the term \"limits\" 500 times in a lecture.", "normalised": "So, next time you see those intimidating equations in calculus, don't run away!
