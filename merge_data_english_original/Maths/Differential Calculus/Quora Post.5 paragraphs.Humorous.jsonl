Seriously though, it's not as scary as your Class 12 physics teacher made it out to be. Think of it less as some abstract mathematical voodoo and more like… figuring out how fast your chai is cooling down, or how quickly your bank balance is vanishing after a shopping spree on Amazon.in.

Differential calculus helps you figure out *exactly* how much your samosa consumption rate is changing at any given moment. Is it dropping rapidly? Is it leveling off? It's like having a speedometer for your samosa intake! This, my friends, is a derivative.", "normalised": "Let's say you're addicted to samosas.

{"unnormalised": "Formally, the derivative of a function at a point basically tells you the slope of the tangent line at that point. Now, I know that sounds like textbook mumbo jumbo. Imagine you're drawing a graph of your speed while driving from Delhi to Agra. The derivative at any point on the graph tells you how much you were accelerating or decelerating at that *exact* second. So if the slope is, like, 0, you're neither accelerating nor decelerating at that instance.
