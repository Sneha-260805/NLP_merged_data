{"unnormalised": "Prof. Mehta, dressed in a simple cotton saree, walked onto the stage. She was a picture of quiet confidence. No grand pronouncements, no theatrical gestures. Just a calm, assured presence that commanded respect. She began by briefly reviewing the fundamentals of L'Hôpital's Rule, reminding everyone of its importance in evaluating limits of indeterminate forms like 0/0 or ∞/∞. She quoted a classic text: \"Thomas' Calculus, 14th Edition, page 357\".", "normalised": "Professor Mehta, dressed in a simple cotton saree, walked onto the stage.

{"unnormalised": "Then, she unveiled her proof. It was elegant, deceptively simple. A series of carefully constructed equations, building upon existing theorems but culminating in a shortcut that could potentially save hours of calculation. She demonstrated it with an example, solving a complex limit problem in just 5 lines. Previously, similar problems would've taken around 20 lines. The room erupted in applause.", "normalised": "Then, she unveiled her proof. It was elegant, deceptively simple.

Engineering students grappling with circuit analysis, economists modelling market trends, physicists studying quantum mechanics – all could benefit from this new approach. It was a tool, Prof. Mehta explained, that could unlock new possibilities in diverse fields.

Questions flew from all corners of the auditorium, challenging the assumptions, probing the limitations, exploring the potential applications. Prof. Mehta answered each one with patience and clarity, demonstrating a deep understanding of her subject. As I left IIT Kanpur that evening, the sky ablaze with the colors of sunset, I knew I had witnessed something truly special. This was not just a new proof; it was a testament to the power of Indian intellect and a potential game-changer in the world of mathematics.
