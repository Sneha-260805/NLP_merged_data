{"unnormalised": "Differential calculus, a core area in mathematics, deals with the study of rates at which quantities change. At its heart lies the concept of a derivative. For example, if we have a function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1, finding its derivative, denoted as f'(x), allows us to determine the slope of the tangent line at any given point. In this particular example, f'(x) equals 6x + 2. This is a foundational concept for students preparing for exams like IIT-JEE, where a strong grasp of differentiation techniques is crucial. Understanding that lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h is the fundamental definition of a derivative is also important.", "normalised": "Differential calculus, a core area in mathematics, deals with the study of rates at which quantities change.

{"unnormalised": "One of the key applications of differential calculus is in optimization problems. Consider a scenario where a farmer in Punjab wants to maximize the area of a rectangular field given a fixed perimeter of, say, 400 meters. By expressing the area as a function of one variable and finding the critical points using derivatives, the farmer can determine the dimensions that yield the maximum area. Similarly, businesses use calculus to minimize costs or maximize profits. This involves setting the derivative of the cost or profit function to zero and solving for the optimal values, keeping in mind constraints like budget limitations (e.g., Rs. 50,000 for advertising).", "normalised": "One of the key applications of differential calculus is in optimization problems.

{"unnormalised": "The rules of differentiation, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule, are essential tools. For instance, differentiating sin(2x) requires the chain rule. Let u = 2x, then sin(u)' = cos(u) * u', which gives us 2cos(2x). Mastering these rules allows for efficiently differentiating complex functions, such as y = x^3*e^(-x), which requires the product rule in conjunction with other derivative formulas. Practical application is gained through solving multiple problems of difficulty level 7/10.", "normalised": "The rules of differentiation, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule, are essential tools.

Mastering these rules allows for efficiently differentiating complex functions, such as y equals x cubed multiplied by e to the power of negative x, which requires the product rule in conjunction with other derivative formulas. Practical application is gained through solving multiple problems of difficulty level seven divided by ten."}
