{"unnormalised": "Okay, so differential calculus is all about finding the *rate of change* of something. Think of it like this: you're riding your Bajaj scooter from your house in Bandra to your friend Rohan's place in Andheri. The distance between your houses is maybe 25 km. Now, calculus helps you figure out how fast your distance from your house is changing *at any given moment* during your ride. This \"at any given moment\" part is crucial. That is what the limit helps do!", "normalised": "Okay, so differential calculus is all about finding the rate of change of something.

{"unnormalised": "The d/dx thing you mentioned? That's a notation. It basically means \"the derivative with respect to x.\" \"x\" could be anything. Maybe it represents time, maybe it represents the amount of sugar you add to your chai (we’ll keep it to 2 teaspoons!), maybe it's the number of likes on your Insta post. The derivative tells you how a function changes as \"x\" changes.", "normalised": "The d slash d x thing you mentioned? That is a notation.

{"unnormalised": "So, what is the derivative? Imagine you're plotting a graph of your distance from home (y-axis) against time (x-axis) during that scooter ride. You won't be driving at a constant speed, right? You'll speed up, slow down, maybe stop at a signal near the flyover by the airport. The derivative at any point on that graph is simply the *slope* of the tangent line at that point. Visualizing this really helps me. This slope represents your instantaneous speed at that particular instant of time. A positive slope? You're moving away from home, and the steeper the slope, the faster you're going. Slope of zero? You have stopped at the signal near Linking Road.", "normalised": "So, what is the derivative?

{"unnormalised": "Let's say you have a function f(x) = x^2. This is something you would have encountered in Class 10, no? The derivative of this function, written as f'(x) or d/dx (x^2), is 2x. What does this mean? It means that the rate of change of x^2 with respect to x is 2x. If x=3, then the rate of change is 2 * 3 = 6. If x=5, then the rate of change is 2 * 5 = 10. See how it is getting faster as x increases! You could also encounter something like: f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 7, in which case f'(x) = 15x^2 + 4x - 1.", "normalised": "Let us say you have a function f(x) equals x squared. This is something you would have encountered in Class ten, no? The derivative of this function, written as f prime of x or d slash d x of x squared, is two x. What does this mean? It means that the rate of change of x squared with respect to x is two x. If x equals three, then the rate of change is two multiplied by three equals six. If x equals five, then the rate of change is two multiplied by five equals ten. See how it is getting faster as x increases! You could also encounter something like: f(x) equals five x cubed plus two x squared minus x plus seven, in which case f prime of x equals fifteen x squared plus four x minus one."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, the concept of limits is important here. The derivative is actually *defined* using limits. It's about finding the slope of the tangent line by getting infinitely close to a point on the curve. Think of it like zooming in on that graph until you can't see the curve anymore! So, don’t sweat the limit too much for now. Focus on what you are trying to achieve!", "normalised": "Now, the concept of limits is important here. The derivative is actually defined using limits.
