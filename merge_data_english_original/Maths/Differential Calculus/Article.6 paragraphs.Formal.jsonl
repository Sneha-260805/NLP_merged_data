{"unnormalised": "One of the primary applications lies in optimization problems. Businesses, for example, utilize differential calculus to determine the optimal production levels to maximize profit or minimize costs. Suppose a company wants to minimize the cost C of producing x units, given by the cost function C(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 15x. Finding the derivative, C'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 15, and setting it to 0 allows us to find the critical points, which represent potential minima or maxima. Solving 3x^2 - 12x + 15 = 0 will reveal the production level that minimizes cost, although, in this example, there are no real roots for the derivative, which indicates this is not a cost function that reaches a minimum value.", "normalised": "One of the primary applications lies in optimisation problems.

Suppose a company wants to minimise the cost C of producing x units, given by the cost function C of x equals x cubed minus six x squared plus fifteen x. Finding the derivative, C prime of x equals three x squared minus twelve x plus fifteen, and setting it to zero allows us to find the critical points, which represent potential minima or maxima.

If the position of a particle is given by the function s(t) = 5t^2 + 2t + 3, where s is in meters and t is in seconds, the velocity, v(t), is obtained by differentiating s(t) with respect to time, resulting in v(t) = ds/dt = 10t + 2 m/s. Similarly, the acceleration, a(t), is found by differentiating v(t), yielding a(t) = dv/dt = 10 m/s^2. This highlights the power of differential calculus in describing the motion of objects. Such applications can be taught to students preparing for JEE exams at various coaching centres.", "normalised": "Another crucial application can be observed in kinematics, the study of motion.

This is particularly relevant in fields like economics, where variables such as price and quantity demanded interact to determine market equilibrium. Consider a function z = f(x, y). The partial derivative of z with respect to x, denoted as ∂z/∂x, represents the rate of change of z with respect to x, holding y constant. Similarly, ∂z/∂y represents the rate of change with respect to y, holding x constant. For instance, if z = x^2 + 2xy + y^3, then ∂z/∂x = 2x + 2y and ∂z/∂y = 2x + 3y^2.", "normalised": "Moreover, the concept of partial derivatives extends the principles of differentiation to functions of multiple variables.

Newton's method, for instance, is an iterative technique used to find approximations of the roots of a real-valued function. Given an initial guess x_0, the method iteratively refines the approximation using the formula x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). This is particularly useful when dealing with complex functions where finding the roots analytically is challenging, or impossible.
