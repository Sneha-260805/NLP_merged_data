{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some help with diff calc! I'm prepping for my JEE and I'm seriously stuck on some of these problems. Like, I get the basics, you know, d/dx of x^n = nx^(n-1), that's all good. But when the questions get a little tricky, I just blank out.", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some help with differential calculus!

{"unnormalised": "For example, I was trying to solve this problem from my coaching material, it's like \"Find dy/dx if y = e^(sin(x^2))\". I tried the chain rule but I keep getting it wrong. The answer key says it should be 2x * cos(x^2) * e^(sin(x^2)), but I'm not sure how they got there. Any tips on how to approach these type of problems? Maybe some tricks or shortcuts?", "normalised": "For example, I was trying to solve this problem from my coaching material, it is like \"Find d y divided by d x if y equals e to the power of sine of x squared\".

{"unnormalised": "Also, derivatives of implicit functions are killing me! Especially when there's a mix of trigonometric functions and polynomials. One question was like, x^2 + y^2 = sin(xy), find dy/dx.

My teacher at school is good, but sometimes I need a different perspective. Maybe something that breaks down the steps really clearly? I'm aiming for a score of around 180/300 in JEE mains, so I seriously need to up my game.", "normalised": "Is there any good website or You Tube channel anyone would recommend that explains these concepts in a simple way?
