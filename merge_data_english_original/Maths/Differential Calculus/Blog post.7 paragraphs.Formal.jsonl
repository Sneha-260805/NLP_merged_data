{"unnormalised": "Differential calculus, a cornerstone of mathematical analysis, provides a powerful framework for understanding rates of change and optimization. Its principles are not confined to theoretical exercises; instead, they permeate a vast spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines, proving invaluable for problem-solving and innovation. At its heart lies the concept of the derivative, denoted often as dy/dx or f'(x), which quantifies the instantaneous rate at which a function's output changes with respect to its input.", "normalised": "Differential calculus, a cornerstone of mathematical analysis, provides a powerful framework for understanding rates of change and optimization.

{"unnormalised": "The historical roots of differential calculus can be traced back to the 17th century, with foundational contributions from both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Although their approaches differed, their combined work laid the groundwork for the formalization of this branch of mathematics. Newton's focus stemmed from his investigations into physics, particularly the study of motion and gravitational forces. Leibniz, on the other hand, approached the subject from a more abstract and symbolic perspective, developing a notation that is still widely used today.", "normalised": "The historical roots of differential calculus can be traced back to the seventeenth century, with foundational contributions from both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

{"unnormalised": "A fundamental tool in differential calculus is the concept of limits. The derivative is essentially the limit of the difference quotient as the change in the input approaches zero. Expressed mathematically, this is represented as: lim (h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h. Understanding limits is crucial for grasping the essence of the derivative as a measure of instantaneous change, rather than an average rate of change over a finite interval.", "normalised": "A fundamental tool in differential calculus is the concept of limits.

{"unnormalised": "Several key rules govern the process of differentiation, enabling us to find derivatives of various types of functions. The power rule, for example, states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1). The product rule dictates that the derivative of a product of two functions, u(x) and v(x), is u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x). Similarly, the quotient rule provides a formula for differentiating the ratio of two functions. The chain rule, represented as d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x), is indispensable for differentiating composite functions.", "normalised": "Several key rules govern the process of differentiation, enabling us to find derivatives of various types of functions.

{"unnormalised": "Applications of differential calculus extend far beyond pure mathematics. In physics, it is used to determine velocity, acceleration, and other kinematic quantities. In engineering, it is employed to optimize designs, analyze stability, and control systems. Economics leverages differential calculus to maximize profits, minimize costs, and model market behavior. For instance, the marginal cost, often denoted MC(x), which signifies the cost of producing one additional unit, can be found using differential calculus. Say the total cost of production is given by C(x)= 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 10x + 50 (all values in Rs), then MC(x) = dC/dx = 6x^2 + 10x + 10 Rs.", "normalised": "Applications of differential calculus extend far beyond pure mathematics.

{"unnormalised": "Optimization is another key application. By finding the points where the derivative of a function is equal to 0, known as critical points, we can identify potential maxima and minima. These points represent the highest and lowest values of the function within a given interval. Further analysis, using the second derivative test, allows us to distinguish between maxima and minima. For example, if f''(x) > 0 at a critical point, then the function has a local minimum at that point.", "normalised": "Optimization is another key application.
