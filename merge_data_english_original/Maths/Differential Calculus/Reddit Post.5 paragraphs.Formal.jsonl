{"unnormalised": "I'm facing a bit of a hurdle in my differential calculus course, specifically with problems involving related rates. I've understood the basic concepts, but I'm struggling when the questions get a bit more complex, especially when they involve geometric figures. For example, if a cone's radius is increasing at a rate of 2 cm/sec and its height is decreasing at a rate of 1 cm/sec, how does one calculate the rate of change of the cone's volume when the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm?", "normalised": "I am facing a bit of a hurdle in my differential calculus course, specifically with problems involving related rates.

{"unnormalised": "I've tried using the formula for the volume of a cone (V = 1/3πr²h) and differentiating it with respect to time, but I keep getting confused with the chain rule and ensuring that I'm properly substituting the given values. I’m getting answers in the form of 'x' cm3/sec. Is there a standard approach that I'm missing or a common pitfall I should be aware of? I'm also having some trouble with optimization problems, particularly those that involve constraints.", "normalised": "I have tried using the formula for the volume of a cone (V equals one divided by three pi r squared h) and differentiating it with respect to time, but I keep getting confused with the chain rule and ensuring that I am properly substituting the given values.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, I am curious about the applications of differential calculus. We know derivatives are used to measure rates of change but how is it actually applied in fields like engineering, economics or even something like computer graphics? My professor mentioned things like “gradient descent” and \"optimization of algorithms\". Can anyone provide a straightforward, intuitive breakdown of a real-world scenario using differential calculus? I am also preparing for my exam on 20/07/2024 and would greatly appreciate any quick notes or cheat sheets that would help in solving such problems.", "normalised": "Moreover, I am curious about the applications of differential calculus.

I’ve already worked through the textbook exercises, but I need more variety to solidify my understanding.
