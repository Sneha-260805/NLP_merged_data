{"unnormalised": "Then, one day, while I was procrastinating by watching a Bollywood movie (totally not recommended before exams!), I had a sort of epiphany.

{"unnormalised": "Instead of just memorizing formulas, I started visualizing what was actually happening. For example, I imagined the derivative as the slope of a tangent line to a curve – like the speed of an auto-rickshaw changing as it navigates the chaotic Delhi streets. The integral became the area under the curve – like calculating the total rainfall during the monsoon season using data from 10 rain gauges.", "normalised": "Instead of just memorizing formulas, I started visualizing what was actually happening.
