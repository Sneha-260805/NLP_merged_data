{"unnormalised": "He recalled one particularly challenging problem involving finding the derivative of a complex function. It took him nearly 3 hours to solve, filling pages with equations, eventually arriving at the answer: dy/dx = (2x + 1) / (x^2 + x + 1). Even after all that effort, he wasn't entirely sure if his solution was correct until Prof. Rao, his mentor, patiently walked him through each step.", "normalised": "He recalled one particularly challenging problem involving finding the derivative of a complex function.

{"unnormalised": "The lecture hall slowly filled up, students shuffling in with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Some were eager to dive into the world of limits and derivatives, while others looked as though they'd rather be anywhere else. Prof. Sharma knew he had a tough task ahead - making differential calculus, a subject often perceived as abstract and intimidating, relatable to his students. He decided to start with a real-world example: calculating the rate of change of water level in a tank. He showed them the formula: dV/dt = A(dh/dt), explaining how it connected to their everyday lives.", "normalised": "The lecture hall slowly filled up, students shuffling in with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
