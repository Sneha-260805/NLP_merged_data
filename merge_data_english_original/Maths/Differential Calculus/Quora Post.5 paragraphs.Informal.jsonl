{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about differential calculus, huh? It's basically about finding the rate of change of something. Think about it like this: if you're driving your scooter from Delhi to Jaipur, your speed isn't constant, right? Sometimes you speed up, sometimes you slow down because of the traffic or those pesky potholes. Differential calculus helps us figure out your exact speed at, say, exactly 2:30 PM, assuming you started at 9 AM. It's not about the average speed; it's about the instantaneous speed at that precise moment.", "normalised": "okay so someone asked about differential calculus huh it's basically about finding the rate of change of something think about it like this if you're driving your scooter from Delhi to Jaipur your speed isn't constant right sometimes you speed up sometimes you slow down because of the traffic or those pesky potholes differential calculus helps us figure out your exact speed at say exactly two thirty P M assuming you started at nine A M it's not about the average speed it's about the instantaneous speed at that precise moment"}
{"unnormalised": "Now, how do we do that? We use something called a derivative. Imagine zooming in on your speed graph until it looks like a straight line. The slope of that line is the derivative! It tells us how much your position changes with respect to time. So, if your position is given by some complicated formula like x = 3t^2 + 5t + 2 (where x is in meters and t is in seconds), the derivative (dx/dt) will give you your velocity. You'll usually find it as dx/dt = 6t + 5 m/s. At t= 10 sec, velocity = 65 m/s.", "normalised": "now how do we do that we use something called a derivative imagine zooming in on your speed graph until it looks like a straight line the slope of that line is the derivative it tells us how much your position changes with respect to time so if your position is given by some complicated formula like x equals three t squared plus five t plus two where x is in meters and t is in seconds the derivative d x divided by d t will give you your velocity you'll usually find it as d x divided by d t equals six t plus five meter per second at t equals ten second velocity equals sixty five meter per second"}
{"unnormalised": "Derivatives aren't just about speed, though. They can be used in all sorts of places! For example, if a shopkeeper in Chandni Chowk wants to maximize their profit, they can use derivatives to figure out the optimal price for their sarees. If the profit function looks something like P = 1000x - 2x^2 (where x is the price), the derivative dP/dx will tell you where the profit is highest. Setting dP/dx = 0 gives you 1000 - 4x = 0, so x = Rs. 250 is the optimal price.", "normalised": "derivatives aren't just about speed though they can be used in all sorts of places for example if a shopkeeper in Chandni Chowk wants to maximize their profit they can use derivatives to figure out the optimal price for their sarees if the profit function looks something like P equals one thousand x minus two x squared where x is the price the derivative d P divided by d x will tell you where the profit is highest setting d P divided by d x equals zero gives you one thousand minus four x equals zero so x equals rupees two hundred and fifty is the optimal price"}
{"unnormalised": "Another cool application is finding the minimum or maximum of any function. Suppose you want to find the smallest possible value of y = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x. You'd take the derivative dy/dx (which is 3x^2 - 12x + 9) and set it to zero. This gives you 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0, which simplifies to x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation gives you x = 1 or x = 3. Plugging these values back into the original equation tells you which is the minimum (x=3) and which is the maximum (x=1).", "normalised": "another cool application is finding the minimum or maximum of any function suppose you want to find the smallest possible value of y equals x cubed minus six x squared plus nine x you'd take the derivative d y divided by d x which is three x squared minus twelve x plus nine and set it to zero this gives you three x squared minus twelve x plus nine equals zero which simplifies to x squared minus four x plus three equals zero solving this quadratic equation gives you x equals one or x equals three plugging these values back into the original equation tells you which is the minimum x equals three and which is the maximum x equals one"}
{"unnormalised": "Basically, differential calculus is a super-powerful tool that helps us understand how things change. From figuring out your scooter's speed to maximizing a shopkeeper's profit or minimizing a function, it's all about rates of change. You’ll need to practice a lot of examples, especially those nasty looking ones with trig functions! Look in your NCERT textbook for more examples!", "normalised": "basically differential calculus is a super powerful tool that helps us understand how things change from figuring out your scooter's speed to maximizing a shopkeeper's profit or minimizing a function it's all about rates of change you'll need to practice a lot of examples especially those nasty looking ones with trig functions look in your N-C-E-R-T textbook for more examples"}
