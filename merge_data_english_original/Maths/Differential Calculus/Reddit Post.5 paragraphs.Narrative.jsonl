{"unnormalised": "Okay, so I was prepping for my engineering entrance exams (JEE, you know the drill) and differential calculus was giving me legit nightmares. I mean, integrals? Fine, I could somehow manage. But dy/dx? Ugh. My coaching centre, FIITJEE Delhi, had these massive problem sets and half the time I just stared blankly. The concepts felt so abstract – like, what even *is* the instantaneous rate of change? My tuition sir, Mr. Sharma, kept saying “Think of it like speed, beta! Just like your car’s speedometer!” But my auto-rickshaw commutes were anything *but* smooth, definitely not differentiable functions!", "normalised": "Okay, so I was prepping for my engineering entrance exams (J-E-E, you know the drill) and differential calculus was giving me legit nightmares.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the epiphany. See, I was at my Nani’s place in Kerala for the holidays. Nani has this beautiful garden, right? Full of jasmine, and mango trees, and…well, everything green. And this one particular vine, it was growing like crazy! I asked her about it, and she just smiled and said, “Every day it grows a little, beta. Some days more than others, depending on the rain.” BAM. Differential calculus. Right there, in Nani’s garden. The vine’s length, L, was a function of time, t, L(t). And the rate at which it was growing, dL/dt, was just…how much it grew each day!", "normalised": "Then came the epiphany.

{"unnormalised": "Mr. Sharma had tried to explain using graphs and tangents, but seeing the vine, growing in *real* time…it clicked. So, one sunny afternoon, surrounded by jasmine and mangoes, I decided to tackle that FIITJEE problem set again. This time, every time I saw dy/dx, I pictured Nani’s vine. If y was the area of a circle, and x was the radius, then dA/dr was just how much the area changed when you increased the radius *just a little bit*. It wasn't some scary, abstract thing anymore.", "normalised": "Mister Sharma had tried to explain using graphs and tangents, but seeing the vine, growing in real time…it clicked.

{"unnormalised": "Suddenly, the problems seemed…less daunting. I still messed up, of course. Forgot chain rule here, missed a minus sign there. But now, I wasn’t just blindly applying formulas. I was visualizing the change. I even managed to solve this one particularly nasty question involving exponential decay (something about radioactive isotopes or something), purely because I pictured how the vine’s growth rate *might* slow down as it reached its maximum length (Okay, that last part might be a *slight* exaggeration, but the point stands). I still had lots to learn - 100% of the syllabus was yet to be covered, but getting the concepts behind differential calculus helped.", "normalised": "Suddenly, the problems seemed…less daunting.

{"unnormalised": "So yeah, that's my story of how Nani's vine taught me differential calculus. Moral of the story: sometimes, the best way to understand abstract concepts is to look around you.
