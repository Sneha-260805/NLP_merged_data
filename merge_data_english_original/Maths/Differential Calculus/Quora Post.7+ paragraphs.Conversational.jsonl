{"unnormalised": "First off, what IS it? Think of differential calculus as the math of change. It's all about figuring out how things change over time, or in relation to each other. You've probably heard terms like \"derivatives\" and \"rate of change.\" Those are the bread and butter of this topic. Now, before you start picturing some crazy long equation, let's start with a basic example.", "normalised": "First off, what is it? Think of differential calculus as the math of change.

{"unnormalised": "Imagine you're driving a car. Your speed isn't always constant, right? Sometimes you speed up (accelerate), sometimes you slow down (decelerate), and sometimes you stay at the same speed. Differential calculus lets you figure out your instantaneous speed at any given moment. It can also help you find out how quickly you're accelerating or decelerating. If the distance you’ve travelled can be described as function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1, then the instantaneous speed is f’(x) = 4x + 3. It’s all about finding the \"derivative\" of a function.", "normalised": "Imagine you're driving a car. Your speed isn't always constant, right?

{"unnormalised": "One of the main tools in differential calculus is the derivative. The derivative of a function tells you the slope of the tangent line at any point on the function's graph. That sounds complicated, but it's just a fancy way of saying it tells you how steep the function is at that point.", "normalised": "One of the main tools in differential calculus is the derivative.

{"unnormalised": "Now, where does it come up in real life? Everywhere! In physics, it’s used to calculate velocity, acceleration, and forces. In economics, it can help businesses maximize profits or minimize costs. In computer science, it's used in machine learning algorithms to find the best settings for a model. It's really incredibly useful in so many different fields. Consider this: If you have function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x – 3, then to calculate where the maximum or minimum occurs, you can derive the function to f’(x) = 3x^2 – 12x + 9 and set the result to 0. Solving for x will tell you where the max/min occurs.", "normalised": "Now, where does it come up in real life? Everywhere! In physics, it's used to calculate velocity, acceleration, and forces.

{"unnormalised": "Let’s go back to a basic concept. Recall that a function of the form y=mx + b denotes a straight line. The ‘m’ in that equation is the slope.

{"unnormalised": "You'll probably encounter some common derivative rules, such as the power rule (the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1)) and the chain rule (which is used when you have a function inside another function).

{"unnormalised": "So, if you're struggling with differential calculus, don't get discouraged. Take it one step at a time, practice plenty of problems, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Start with functions like f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 2. You may be thinking “why this function and not f(x) = cos(x) + sin(x). The answer is because it’s an easier function to deal with! The function f(x) = x^2 + 3x – 2 is a polynomial function, so it doesn’t require you to deal with trig functions or anything crazy like that. Keep practising and you'll get there.
