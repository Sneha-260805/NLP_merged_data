{"unnormalised": "Think about it – designing a flyover in Mumbai. Do you really need to calculate the stress on every single micron of steel with absolute precision? Prof. Sharma’s method allows engineers to get a close-enough estimate in, like, a fraction of the time. He demonstrated the technique using a problem involving a 3rd order differential equation, reducing the calculation time from 2 hrs to roughly 30 mins.", "normalised": "Think about it – designing a flyover in Mumbai.
