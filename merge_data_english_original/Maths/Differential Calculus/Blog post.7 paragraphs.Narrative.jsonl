{"unnormalised": "It all started, as most things do in my life, with chai. A strong, sweet cup of masala chai, sipped on my balcony overlooking the chaotic tapestry of Delhi at 7:00 AM. I was preparing to tutor young Rohan in Differential Calculus. Rohan, bless his heart, was struggling. \"It's all just…lines and slopes, Sir!\" he’d lamented the previous day. He was missing the magic, the *story*.", "normalised": "it all started, as most things do in my life, with chai. a strong, sweet cup of masala chai, sipped on my balcony overlooking the chaotic tapestry of delhi at seven a-m. i was preparing to tutor young rohan in differential calculus. rohan, bless his heart, was struggling. \"it's all just…lines and slopes, sir!\" he’d lamented the previous day. he was missing the magic, the story."}
{"unnormalised": "Differential calculus, I explained over the phone, isn't just about finding slopes of tangents, it’s about understanding change, about seeing the world in motion. Think about the stock market, I suggested. How do you predict whether Reliance will hit Rs. 3000? Or consider the speed of a cricket ball bowled by Bumrah, clocking 140 kmph. It’s a game of instantaneous rates of change, a dance of derivatives!", "normalised": "differential calculus, i explained over the phone, isn't just about finding slopes of tangents, it’s about understanding change, about seeing the world in motion. think about the stock market, i suggested. how do you predict whether reliance will hit rupees three thousand? or consider the speed of a cricket ball bowled by bumrah, clocking one hundred and forty kilometer per hour. it’s a game of instantaneous rates of change, a dance of derivatives!"}
{"unnormalised": "Rohan’s eyes still glazed over during our first hour at 10 AM, even after a generous helping of my mother’s homemade jalebis. But I persevered. We started with the basics: limits, continuity. I drew diagrams on my whiteboard, illustrating how a secant line morphs into a tangent as the interval shrinks to zero. We tackled problems involving functions like f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5. \"Find f'(2),\" I instructed, and watched him dutifully apply the power rule.", "normalised": "rohan’s eyes still glazed over during our first hour at ten a-m, even after a generous helping of my mother’s homemade jalebis. but i persevered. we started with the basics: limits, continuity. i drew diagrams on my whiteboard, illustrating how a secant line morphs into a tangent as the interval shrinks to zero. we tackled problems involving functions like f of x equals x squared plus three x minus five. \"find f prime of two,\" i instructed, and watched him dutifully apply the power rule."}
{"unnormalised": "Then came the real challenge: optimization problems. The farmer with a limited amount of fencing (200 meters, let's say) who wants to maximize the area of his rectangular field. Rohan balked. But I nudged him, pointing out the underlying principle: find the critical points, set the derivative to zero. It was like a detective story, I told him, the derivative a magnifying glass revealing hidden truths.", "normalised": "then came the real challenge: optimization problems. the farmer with a limited amount of fencing (two hundred meters, let's say) who wants to maximize the area of his rectangular field. rohan balked. but i nudged him, pointing out the underlying principle: find the critical points, set the derivative to zero. it was like a detective story, i told him, the derivative a magnifying glass revealing hidden truths."}

The answer: a square with sides of 50m each. A small victory, but a significant one.", "normalised": "suddenly, a breakthrough! he attacked the farmer problem with renewed vigor, setting up the equation, finding the derivative, and solving for the dimensions. the answer: a square with sides of fifty meters each. a small victory, but a significant one."}
{"unnormalised": "As the afternoon wore on, we delved into more complex scenarios: related rates, implicit differentiation. I even threw in a real-world application I read about in The Hindu, estimating the rate of spread of a disease given some epidemiological data. Equations flew across the whiteboard, numbers scribbled in rapid succession.", "normalised": "as the afternoon wore on, we delved into more complex scenarios: related rates, implicit differentiation. i even threw in a real-world application i read about in the hindu, estimating the rate of spread of a disease given some epidemiological data. equations flew across the whiteboard, numbers scribbled in rapid succession."}
{"unnormalised": "By 6:00 PM, Rohan was visibly exhausted, but something had shifted. He wasn't just memorizing formulas anymore; he was *thinking* like a mathematician. He was starting to see the world through the lens of calculus, to appreciate the elegance and power of this remarkable tool. And that, I thought, was worth more than all the tea in Darjeeling. He even seemed more confident with the idea of tackling his upcoming test on 20/11/2024. A small step, but a hopeful one.", "normalised": "by six p-m, rohan was visibly exhausted, but something had shifted. he wasn't just memorizing formulas anymore; he was thinking like a mathematician. he was starting to see the world through the lens of calculus, to appreciate the elegance and power of this remarkable tool. and that, i thought, was worth more than all the tea in darjeeling. he even seemed more confident with the idea of tackling his upcoming test on twentieth november two thousand and twenty four. a small step, but a hopeful one."}
