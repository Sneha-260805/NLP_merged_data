{"unnormalised": "At its core, differential calculus deals with rates of change. Remember your physics class? Velocity is just the rate of change of position with respect to time. The basic formula you might recall is something like distance/time = speed. But what if the speed *itself* is changing? That’s where the fun starts. Think about it: maybe you accelerate from 0 kmph to 60 kmph in, say, 10 seconds.", "normalised": "At its core, differential calculus deals with rates of change. Remember your physics class?

{"unnormalised": "We use something called a \"derivative\" to find these instantaneous rates of change. It's basically finding the slope of a curve at a single point. Imagine a graph where the x-axis is time (in seconds) and the y-axis is distance (in meters). If you draw a line that *just* touches the curve at a specific point (a tangent), the slope of that line is the derivative at that point. Let's say at t=2 seconds, your derivative is 5 m/s. That means at that *exact* instant, your velocity is 5 m/s.", "normalised": "We use something called a \"derivative\" to find these instantaneous rates of change.
