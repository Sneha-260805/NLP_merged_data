{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone! Someone asked me about Differential Calculus, and honestly, it’s way less scary than it sounds. Think of it as zooming in *really* close on a curve to see its slope at a single point. We’re talking about finding rates of change – like how fast a car is accelerating or how quickly a population is growing. You’ll see stuff like dy/dx all the time, which is just a fancy way of saying \"the change in y with respect to the change in x.\"", "normalised": "Hey everyone!

{"unnormalised": "So, what’s the point? Well, Differential Calculus is used everywhere. Think physics (velocity, acceleration), economics (marginal cost, marginal revenue), engineering (optimization problems), and even computer science (machine learning algorithms). It lets you find maximums and minimums, which is super useful for optimizing processes. For example, what is the maximum volume for a rectangular prism, with the constraint that the sides should not add to more than \"30 cm.\"", "normalised": "So, what’s the point?
