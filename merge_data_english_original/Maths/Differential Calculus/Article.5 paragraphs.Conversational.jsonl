Calculus helps you understand not just the total distance, but how your speed changes throughout the journey. Maybe you're cruising at 80 km/hr on the highway, then slowing down to 40 km/hr through a town. Differential calculus is the tool to analyze these moment-to-moment changes.", "normalised": "differential calculus, eh? Sounds scary, but trust me, it is just about understanding change.

Imagine the curve representing the price of gold, which is currently at ₹71,500 per 10 grams. The derivative at any point on the curve tells you how quickly the gold price is changing at that very instant. Is it going up fast, going down slowly, or staying about the same? It's all in the derivative.", "normalised": "The core idea? Derivatives. A derivative, in simple terms, tells you the slope of a curve at a specific point.

So, f'(x) = 2x, and thus f'(2) = 4. That means the function is increasing at a rate of 4 units at that point! Simple, no? This is massively useful in lots of fields, not just pure maths.", "normalised": "Now, let us say we want to find the slope of the function f of x equals x squared at x equals two.

{"unnormalised": "Think about optimizing a business. You want to maximize profit, right? Calculus can help! If your profit function is something like P(x) = -0.5x^2 + 5x + 10 (where x is the number of units sold), finding the maximum involves taking the derivative (P'(x) = -x + 5), setting it to 0, and solving for x. You'll find that the maximum profit occurs when x=5. It helps decide production quantities, understand cost changes, or predict revenue fluctuations.", "normalised": "Think about optimizing a business. You want to maximize profit, right?

Give it a shot, practice some problems, and you’ll be differentiating like a pro in no time!
