It's basically finding the slope of a curve at a single point. And honestly, if you’re doing 80 kmph on a Bajaj, you’re already living dangerously enough without calculus. My grandma used to say learning calculus is harder than making perfect biryani. Though I aced calculus, I still can't make biryani better than her.", "normalised": "Say you're driving your Bajaj scooter from Delhi to Agra.

Well, engineers use it to design everything from bridges (so they don't fall down, hopefully!) to smartphones (so you can endlessly scroll through Instagram). Economists use it to predict market trends (though let's be real, they’re usually wrong anyway). Even doctors use it! (Okay, maybe not directly, but the MRI machine they use relies on calculus principles.) Your JEE exam might contain questions where you have to find dy/dx of a complicated equation. Get those right, and you're one step closer to IIT.", "normalised": "Now, why should you care?

{"unnormalised": "So, there you have it. Differential calculus in a nutshell. It's all about change, rates, and slopes. And trust me, learning it is far more productive than binge-watching another Bollywood movie marathon (unless, of course, you're using calculus to optimize your snack consumption during the marathon – now *that's* some next-level thinking!). You might even impress your crush with your newfound math skills! (Disclaimer: Results may vary. Calculus is rarely a guaranteed romance booster.) Plus, once you understand it, you can laugh at people who still think 2 + 2 = 5. Just kidding... mostly.", "normalised": "So, there you have it. Differential calculus in a nutshell.
