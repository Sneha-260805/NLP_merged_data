{"unnormalised": "Then, during a tutorial, a senior bhai explained it to me with a real-life example. Imagine you're driving your scooty from Delhi to Jaipur, a distance of roughly 280 km. Your speed isn't constant; you might be going 60 kmph on the highway, then slow down to 20 kmph in the city. Differential calculus helps you find your *instantaneous* speed at, say, exactly 2:15 PM. That 'instantaneous speed' is essentially the derivative.", "normalised": "Then, during a tutorial, a senior bhai explained it to me with a real life example.

{"unnormalised": "The concept of limits was also tricky. The prof wrote something like lim (h->0) [f(x+h)-f(x)]/h on the board. It looked scary! But the bhai explained that it just means we're trying to find what happens to a function as we get *incredibly* close to a certain point, without actually reaching it. Think of it like trying to get to the last grain of sugar in your chai – you can get infinitesimally close, but you might not actually reach it if you are too lazy to scoop it out.", "normalised": "The concept of limits was also tricky.

{"unnormalised": "Once I understood these basic ideas, the rest of the course started making more sense. I started applying formulas like d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1) to solve actual problems.

Got a B+ on that exam eventually, definitely thanks to that chai-loving bhai!", "normalised": "Once I understood these basic ideas, the rest of the course started making more sense.

{"unnormalised": "So, if you're struggling with differential calculus, don't worry! Just break it down, find real-life examples, and don't be afraid to ask for help. You got this! Remember, it’s about small changes (dx) leading to big insights!", "normalised": "So, if you're struggling with differential calculus, don't worry!
