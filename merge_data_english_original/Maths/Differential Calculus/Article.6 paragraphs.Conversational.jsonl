{"unnormalised": "At its core, diff calc is based on the idea of a \"derivative.\" A derivative basically tells you the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a particular point. Now, you might be thinking \"tangent\", \"curve\", \"slope\" - more jargon! Don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds. A tangent is a line that just touches the curve at one spot, like a bike barely brushing against a wall. And the slope, well, that's just how steep the line is. We can think of the slope as rise/run or as Δy/Δx in simple terms.", "normalised": "at its core, diff calc is based on the idea of a \"derivative.\" a derivative basically tells you the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a particular point. now, you might be thinking \"tangent\", \"curve\", \"slope\" - more jargon! don't worry, it is simpler than it sounds. a tangent is a line that just touches the curve at one spot, like a bike barely brushing against a wall. and the slope, well, that is just how steep the line is. we can think of the slope as rise divided by run or as delta y divided by delta x in simple terms."}
{"unnormalised": "Let's bring in some formulas. The derivative of a function f(x) is often written as f'(x) or dy/dx. One of the basic rules is the power rule: if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1). So, if f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x. Easy peasy, right? There are other rules too, like the product rule and quotient rule for functions that are multiplied or divided. Don't worry, you won't need to memorise all of them by tomorrow 9 AM. There are so many ways to learn these these days.", "normalised": "let us bring in some formulas. the derivative of a function f of x is often written as f prime of x or d y d x. one of the basic rules is the power rule: if f of x equals x to the power of n, then f prime of x equals n times x to the power of n minus one. so, if f of x equals x squared, then f prime of x equals two x. easy peasy, right? there are other rules too, like the product rule and quotient rule for functions that are multiplied or divided. don't worry, you won't need to memorise all of them by tomorrow nine A-M. there are so many ways to learn these these days."}

Economists use it to model market trends and predict future prices, perhaps figuring out when Tata Steel shares might hit ₹1500.

{"unnormalised": "But don't think calculus is just for the pros. Consider this simple example: if you're filling up a water tank at your home, you may want to know how long will it take if the volume is 2000 litres and the rate of inflow is 10 litres/minute. Differential calculus can help you solve such problems with ease. So you see calculus is not something you need to fear or think is useless, it is there in our daily lives too.", "normalised": "but don't think calculus is just for the pros. consider this simple example: if you are filling up a water tank at your home, you may want to know how long will it take if the volume is two thousand liters and the rate of inflow is ten liters per minute. differential calculus can help you solve such problems with ease. so you see calculus is not something you need to fear or think is useless, it is there in our daily lives too."}
