{"unnormalised": "Then there's the whole thing about what kind of GST number I actually need. I'm so confused! I read somewhere that you only need a GSTIN if your annual turnover is above Rs. 20 lakh. But what if I cross that threshold later? Do I have to re-register? Also, I'm planning to export some sarees eventually. Does that change things? Does exporting necessitate an Import Export Code, or IEC (e.g. 05XXXXXXXX)? It's all so unclear!
