{"unnormalised": "First, we have the ubiquitous Aadhaar card. It's that little piece of laminated paper with your UIDAI No. plastered across it. Think of it as your digital soul, only slightly less terrifying. You need it for everything – opening a bank account (or trying to), getting a gas connection (maybe), and even proving you're not a ghost when you try to buy movie tickets online. Just don’t lose it; you’ll spend the next week yelling at customer service bots.", "normalised": "First, we have the ubiquitous Aadhaar card.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the PAN card. Your Permanent Account Number, issued by the Income Tax Department, is your financial GPS. This ten-character alphanumeric code (e.g., ABCDE1234F) is crucial for all things money-related. Investing in stocks? PAN. Selling property? PAN. Donating more than Rs. 50,000 to a political party? PAN (though, maybe don’t do that last one). Imagine forgetting your PAN while filing taxes - the IT dept might send you a love letter...written in code, with threats of penalties.", "normalised": "Then there's the P-A-N card. Your Permanent Account Number, issued by the Income Tax Department, is your financial G-P-S. This ten-character alphanumeric code (for example, A-B-C-D-E one two three four F) is crucial for all things money-related. Investing in stocks? P-A-N. Selling property? P-A-N. Donating more than rupee fifty thousand to a political party? P-A-N (though, maybe don’t do that last one). Imagine forgetting your P-A-N while filing taxes - the I-T department might send you a love letter...written in code, with threats of penalties."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let’s delve into the corporate world. Businesses aren't exempt from the ID madness. GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) is your badge of honor (or burden) in the GST regime. This 15-digit number is mandatory for all businesses registered under GST. Forget to include it on your invoices? Prepare for the wrath of your accountant and the confused stares of your clients.", "normalised": "Now, let’s delve into the corporate world. Businesses aren't exempt from the I-D madness. G-S-T-I-N (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) is your badge of honor (or burden) in the G-S-T regime. This fifteen-digit number is mandatory for all businesses registered under G-S-T. Forget to include it on your invoices? Prepare for the wrath of your accountant and the confused stares of your clients."}
{"unnormalised": "Speaking of corporations, we have the CIN (Corporate Identity Number). It’s like the Aadhaar for companies, proving they exist and aren't just elaborate figments of someone's entrepreneurial imagination. It can be found on the company's official documents, and failing to provide it might result in a notice from the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs).", "normalised": "Speaking of corporations, we have the C-I-N (Corporate Identity Number).

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number), a 10-digit alphanumeric code required for deducting tax at source (TDS). If you’re running a business and need to deduct TDS, you need a TAN. Not having one while deducting TDS is a bit like trying to drive an auto-rickshaw without a license – you're going to get pulled over, and it won't be pleasant.", "normalised": "Then there's the T-A-N (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number), a ten-digit alphanumeric code required for deducting tax at source (T-D-S).
