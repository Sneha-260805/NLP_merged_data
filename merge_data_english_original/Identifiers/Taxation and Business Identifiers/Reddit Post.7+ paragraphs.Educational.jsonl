{"unnormalised": "First off, let’s talk about the **PAN (Permanent Account Number)**. This is a 10-character alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department. Think of it as your financial fingerprint in India. You need a PAN to file your income tax returns, open a bank account, invest in mutual funds, or even make transactions above Rs. 50,000. It's that important! You can apply for a PAN online through the NSDL e-Gov or UTIITSL websites. Just make sure you have your Aadhaar card handy for verification; otherwise, you'll have to courier physical documents.", "normalised": "First off, let’s talk about the P-A-N (Permanent Account Number). This is a ten character alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department. Think of it as your financial fingerprint in India. You need a P-A-N to file your income tax returns, open a bank account, invest in mutual funds, or even make transactions above rupee fifty thousand. It's that important! You can apply for a P-A-N online through the N-S-D-L e-Gov or U-T-I-I-T-S-L websites. Just make sure you have your Aadhaar card handy for verification; otherwise, you'll have to courier physical documents."}
{"unnormalised": "Next up is the **TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number)**. If you're a business or organization that is required to deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on payments you make (like salaries, rent, or professional fees), you need a TAN. This is another 10-character alphanumeric code, but it's different from your PAN. It’s absolutely essential to quote your TAN correctly in all TDS challans and returns. Failing to do so can lead to penalties from the IT Dept. You can apply for a TAN through the same portals as the PAN application. Remember, if you are not deducting TDS, you don't need a TAN.", "normalised": "Next up is the T-A-N (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number). If you're a business or organization that is required to deduct T-D-S (Tax Deducted at Source) on payments you make (like salaries, rent, or professional fees), you need a T-A-N. This is another ten character alphanumeric code, but it's different from your P-A-N. It’s absolutely essential to quote your T-A-N correctly in all T-D-S challans and returns. Failing to do so can lead to penalties from the I-T Dept. You can apply for a T-A-N through the same portals as the P-A-N application. Remember, if you are not deducting T-D-S, you don't need a T-A-N."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, let's move on to the **GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number)**. If your business's aggregate turnover exceeds Rs. 20 lakh (or Rs. 10 lakh for some special category states), you're required to register under GST and obtain a GSTIN. This is a 15-digit alphanumeric code. The first two digits represent the state code (e.g., 27 for Maharashtra, 06 for Delhi), the next 10 digits are your PAN, and the last three digits are for entity code, default 'Z' and checksum digit. GSTIN allows you to collect and remit GST on your sales, and claim input tax credit on your purchases. You register for GSTIN through the GST portal, and it's a must if you're dealing with inter-state sales or availing of certain benefits.", "normalised": "Now, let's move on to the G-S-T-I-N (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number). If your business's aggregate turnover exceeds rupee twenty lakh (or rupee ten lakh for some special category states), you're required to register under G-S-T and obtain a G-S-T-I-N. This is a fifteen digit alphanumeric code. The first two digits represent the state code (e.g., twenty seven for Maharashtra, zero six for Delhi), the next ten digits are your P-A-N, and the last three digits are for entity code, default 'Z' and checksum digit. G-S-T-I-N allows you to collect and remit G-S-T on your sales, and claim input tax credit on your purchases. You register for G-S-T-I-N through the G-S-T portal, and it's a must if you're dealing with inter-state sales or availing of certain benefits."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the **CIN (Corporate Identity Number)**. This is a 21-digit alphanumeric code assigned to every company registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Think of it as the unique ID for your company. The CIN is mandatory to quote in all ROC e-filing documents. It helps track and identify companies easily. It also indicates whether the company is a public limited company (PLC) or a private limited company (PTC). You don't directly apply for a CIN, it's assigned by the Registrar of Companies (ROC) when your company gets incorporated.", "normalised": "Then there's the C-I-N (Corporate Identity Number). This is a twenty one digit alphanumeric code assigned to every company registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (M-C-A). Think of it as the unique I-D for your company. The C-I-N is mandatory to quote in all R-O-C e-filing documents. It helps track and identify companies easily. It also indicates whether the company is a public limited company (P-L-C) or a private limited company (P-T-C). You don't directly apply for a C-I-N, it's assigned by the Registrar of Companies (R-O-C) when your company gets incorporated."}
{"unnormalised": "Last but not least, is **DIN (Director Identification Number)**. If you want to become a director of a company in India, you need a DIN. It's an 8-digit numeric code assigned by the MCA. You need to apply for DIN through the MCA portal and provide your identity and address proof. Once allotted, a DIN is valid for a lifetime, unless it's surrendered or cancelled. You need to quote your DIN in all documents related to the company in which you are a director. Keep in mind, just having a DIN doesn't automatically make you a director; you also need to be appointed by the company.", "normalised": "Last but not least, is D-I-N (Director Identification Number). If you want to become a director of a company in India, you need a D-I-N. It's an eight digit numeric code assigned by the M-C-A.
