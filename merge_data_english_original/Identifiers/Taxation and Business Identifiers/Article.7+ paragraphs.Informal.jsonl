{"unnormalised": "First up, PAN. That's your Permanent Account Number. It's a 10-character alphanumeric identifier, like ABCDE1234F. Every individual and entity that pays taxes in India needs one. Think of it as your financial fingerprint. You need it for pretty much everything these days, from opening a bank account to filing your income tax returns. For instance, Rakesh Sharma needed his PAN to invest Rs. 5000 in mutual funds.", "normalised": "first up, P-A-N. that's your permanent account number. it's a ten-character alphanumeric identifier, like A-B-C-D-E-one-two-three-four-F. every individual and entity that pays taxes in India needs one. think of it as your financial fingerprint. you need it for pretty much everything these days, from opening a bank account to filing your income tax returns. for instance, Rakesh Sharma needed his P-A-N to invest rupees five thousand in mutual funds."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, we have TAN, the Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number. It's also 10 characters long, but it's needed if you're deducting TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) from payments you make. So, if you're a business owner paying salaries or making certain types of payments, you'll need a TAN to deduct and deposit the tax on behalf of the recipient. For example, XYZ Company, a small IT firm, needs its TAN to deduct TDS when paying its employees' salaries every month before the 7th of the subsequent month. The format is similar to PAN, like DELA12345C.", "normalised": "next, we have T-A-N, the tax deduction and collection account number. it's also ten characters long, but it's needed if you're deducting T-D-S (tax deducted at source) from payments you make. so, if you're a business owner paying salaries or making certain types of payments, you'll need a T-A-N to deduct and deposit the tax on behalf of the recipient. for example, X-Y-Z company, a small I-T firm, needs its T-A-N to deduct T-D-S when paying its employees' salaries every month before the seventh of the subsequent month. the format is similar to P-A-N, like D-E-L-A-one-two-three-four-five-C."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the GSTIN, the Goods and Services Tax Identification Number. With GST becoming the norm, every business registered under GST needs a GSTIN. It's a 15-digit number, like 07AAACC1234A1Z0, and it's essential for filing your GST returns and claiming input tax credit. Suppose Priya's boutique needs a GSTIN to charge GST on her sarees and file her monthly returns by the 20th of each month.", "normalised": "then there's the G-S-T-I-N, the goods and services tax identification number. with G-S-T becoming the norm, every business registered under G-S-T needs a G-S-T-I-N. it's a fifteen-digit number, like zero-seven-triple A-triple C-one-two-three-four-A-one-Z-zero, and it's essential for filing your G-S-T returns and claiming input tax credit. suppose Priya's boutique needs a G-S-T-I-N to charge G-S-T on her sarees and file her monthly returns by the twentieth of each month."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, we have CIN, the Corporate Identification Number. This one's for companies registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). It’s a 21-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each company. For instance, L&T's CIN might look something like U45201MH2007PLC123456. This number helps in tracking the company's records and filings with the MCA.", "normalised": "finally, we have C-I-N, the corporate identification number. this one's for companies registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (M-C-A). it’s a twenty one-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each company. for instance, L and T's C-I-N might look something like U-four-five-two-zero-one-M-H-two-zero-zero-seven-P-L-C-one-two-three-four-five-six. this number helps in tracking the company's records and filings with the M-C-A."}
