Bhai, it's like trying to keep track of all the relatives at an Indian wedding – overwhelming! You’ve got your PAN card, which is like your financial DNA – everyone needs one, like it or not! Then there's your GSTIN, because apparently, taxing things once wasn’t enough, now we have GST as well. It's like having to pay rent to two landlords instead of one.

It’s kinda like they're saying, \"We're taking your money, but we'll give you a special ID for it, so you feel better\". It’s almost as if they expect us to frame it and put it on the wall!

Between your PAN no. like ABCDE1234F and your GSTIN 06AAACC1234A1Z0 you end up feeling like a walking, talking barcode. But hey, at least you're identifiable, right? Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go file some forms...with all those IDs, of course! Wish me luck.
