Think of PAN, or Permanent Account Number, as your financial fingerprint. It's a 10-character alphanumeric code (like ABCDE1234F) that the Income Tax Dept. uses to keep track of your taxes. Everyone who earns income (or does certain financial transactions) needs one, whether you're a salaried person or a big business. It's essential for filing ITR, opening a bank account, and pretty much anything tax-related.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about P-A-N card and G-S-T numbers... basically, they are both identifiers but for different things.
