{"unnormalised": "Currently, several distinct identifier systems coexist, each with its own purpose and scope. The Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) number, a 14-digit unique identifier, is a cornerstone of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). ABHA aims to create a comprehensive health repository for every Indian citizen, allowing for secure access to medical records and enabling efficient healthcare delivery. Alongside ABHA, existing systems like the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) number and Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) beneficiary ID play crucial roles in specific insurance schemes. ESI numbers typically follow a format like 12-345678-90-1234, while CGHS IDs consist of alphanumeric codes, e.g., S/12345/2023.", "normalised": "Currently, several distinct identifier systems coexist, each with its own purpose and scope.

{"unnormalised": "Insurance sector identifiers also contribute to the landscape. Individual policy numbers, often alphanumeric sequences like I-HLTH-2024-123456, are used by private and public insurance companies to track coverage and process claims. These numbers vary considerably in format depending on the insurer. Moreover, Unique Identification Numbers (UIN) assigned by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to insurance agents, like IRDA/A/1234/2023, serve as a regulatory tool for accountability and transparency within the sector.", "normalised": "Insurance sector identifiers also contribute to the landscape.

{"unnormalised": "The adoption of standardized identifiers presents both opportunities and challenges. The heterogeneity of existing systems necessitates careful planning and coordination to ensure interoperability. Data privacy and security are paramount concerns, requiring robust mechanisms to protect sensitive patient information. Moreover, widespread adoption hinges on addressing digital literacy gaps and ensuring equitable access to technology across diverse socioeconomic strata. Imagine a scenario where a patient moving from Guwahati to Chennai needs immediate medical attention. A standardized identifier, like a universally accepted ABHA number, could enable healthcare providers to quickly access the patient's medical history, regardless of the location or insurance provider.", "normalised": "The adoption of standardized identifiers presents both opportunities and challenges.

{"unnormalised": "The successful implementation of a unified identifier system relies heavily on collaborative efforts from government agencies, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and technology vendors. Interoperability standards must be established and enforced to facilitate seamless data exchange. Public awareness campaigns are crucial to educate citizens about the benefits of unique identifiers and address privacy concerns. Incentives for adoption, such as streamlined claims processing and reduced administrative burden, can further encourage stakeholders to embrace the change. For example, hospitals could receive accreditation benefits for integrating ABHA into their existing systems.", "normalised": "The successful implementation of a unified identifier system relies heavily on collaborative efforts from government agencies, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and technology vendors.
