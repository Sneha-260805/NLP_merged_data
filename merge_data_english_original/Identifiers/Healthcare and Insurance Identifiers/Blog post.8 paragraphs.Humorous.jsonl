{"unnormalised": "First up, let's tackle the mighty Aadhaar. Yes, the same Aadhaar you use to prove you're you while buying sim cards and booking train tickets. Turns out, some hospitals are now requesting (or subtly suggesting) you link your Aadhaar (e.g., 1234-5678-9012) to your medical records. The idea, supposedly, is to streamline things. But if streamlining involved 17 forms and a blood sacrifice to the data gods, I'm not sure I'm on board.", "normalised": "First up, let's tackle the mighty Aadhaar.

Now, most states have replaced it with something new, but you still find folks clinging onto it like a winning lottery ticket.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the State-Specific Schemes! Every state has its own pet project, its own brand of healthcare magic. In Maharashtra, you might have the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY), with its own unique beneficiary ID (like MH-1234567890). Good luck keeping track of them all!

But with a little patience, a little humor, and a whole lot of paperwork, you’ll get through it. And hey, at least you'll have a good story to tell at your next family gathering, right?
