One of the first things they asked for was his P-M-J-A-Y I-D. Now, thankfully, he's enrolled in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, so we had that handy. It's a twelve-digit number, looked something like this: two eight one four hyphen seven five nine two hyphen three one six zero. I had actually helped him get this when the P-M-J-A-Y scheme was first launched."}

Finding that policy number was another treasure hunt! It was a long alphanumeric string, something like I-L-H-L zero zero zero zero zero four seven eight nine six five four. I swear, I had to squint at the tiny font on his policy document to make sure I was copying it correctly. The hospital billing clerk kept telling me, \"Sir, enter it correctly, otherwise claim will get rejected\"."}

One unique healthcare identifier would be a godsend. Maybe link everything to Aadhaar, I don’t know.
