{"unnormalised": "Think of your health ID as a digital passport for your health information. It's a 14-digit number (like 1234-5678-9012-34) that uniquely identifies you within the healthcare system. This ID is linked to a health locker, where your medical records, like prescriptions, lab reports, and treatment summaries, can be stored securely. Imagine never having to carry around physical files again – that’s the power of a health ID.", "normalised": "Think of your health I-D as a digital passport for your health information.

{"unnormalised": "One major advantage of a health ID is its ability to simplify the insurance claim process. For example, if Priya Sharma has a Star Health Insurance policy with policy number STAR1234567890, her health ID can be linked to her policy details. When she visits Apollo Hospital, instead of filling out lengthy forms, the hospital staff can quickly access her insurance information using her health ID, streamlining the claim submission process.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, these IDs enable better tracking of public health initiatives. Consider a scenario where a new vaccination program is launched. By linking vaccination records to individual health IDs, public health officials can easily monitor coverage rates, identify gaps, and ensure that everyone receives timely vaccinations. This is much more efficient than relying on manual data entry from 1000s of health workers across the country.", "normalised": "Furthermore, these I-Ds enable better tracking of public health initiatives.

{"unnormalised": "It's important to distinguish between a health ID and other identification documents like Aadhaar (UIDAI: 1234 5678 9012). While Aadhaar is a universal identification number for all Indian residents, a health ID is specifically for healthcare purposes. While both can be linked, the health ID ensures that healthcare data is managed separately and securely. Think of it as a specialized tool for a specific job.", "normalised": "It's important to distinguish between a health I-D and other identification documents like Aadhaar (U-I-D-A-I: one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two).
