However, it is becoming cumbersome to keep track of so many identifiers, especially for senior citizens like my father. It would be incredibly helpful if someone could clarify the necessity of an A-B-H-A I-D in this scenario and if there are any workarounds for those who have existing valid C-G-H-S and private insurance policies. Any guidance on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."}
