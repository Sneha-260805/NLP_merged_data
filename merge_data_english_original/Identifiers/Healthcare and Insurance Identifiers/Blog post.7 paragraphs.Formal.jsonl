{"unnormalised": "In India's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the standardization and management of patient data are becoming increasingly crucial. This need has led to the introduction and increasing importance of various healthcare identifiers. These identifiers, often in unnormalized formats, serve as unique keys to access and manage individual health records, ensuring seamless and efficient healthcare delivery. Understanding these identifiers is essential for both healthcare providers and patients alike.", "normalised": "In India's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the standardization and management of patient data are becoming increasingly crucial.

{"unnormalised": "One of the primary identifiers is the **UHID (Unique Health Identification Number)**. Often presented as a 12-digit number (e.g., 123456789012), the UHID aims to consolidate a patient's medical history across different healthcare providers. For example, a patient visiting AIIMS, Delhi, and subsequently seeking treatment at Apollo Hospital, Chennai, can have their medical records linked under a single UHID. This eliminates the need for redundant tests and facilitates informed clinical decision-making. Different states might implement UHID differently, sometimes with variations like 'DL-UHID-2024-00001' in Delhi.", "normalised": "One of the primary identifiers is the **U-H-I-D (Unique Health Identification Number)**. Often presented as a twelve-digit number (e.g., one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two), the U-H-I-D aims to consolidate a patient's medical history across different healthcare providers. For example, a patient visiting A-I-I-M-S, Delhi, and subsequently seeking treatment at Apollo Hospital, Chennai, can have their medical records linked under a single U-H-I-D. This eliminates the need for redundant tests and facilitates informed clinical decision-making. Different states might implement U-H-I-D differently, sometimes with variations like 'D-L slash U-H-I-D slash two thousand twenty four slash zero zero zero zero one' in Delhi."}
{"unnormalised": "Another key identifier is the **ABHA ID (Ayushman Bharat Health Account ID)**, sometimes referred to as a 'Health ID'. ABHA ID is a 14 digit number (e.g., 1234-5678-9012-34) issued under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM). This initiative seeks to create a unified digital health ecosystem across India. ABHA ID serves as a digital repository for health information, granting patients control over their data and enabling them to share it securely with healthcare providers. The format might be seen like 'ABHA:12345678901234'.", "normalised": "Another key identifier is the **A-B-H-A I-D (Ayushman Bharat Health Account I-D)**, sometimes referred to as a 'Health I-D'. A-B-H-A I-D is a fourteen-digit number (e.g., one two three four hyphen five six seven eight hyphen nine zero one two hyphen three four) issued under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (A-B-D-M). This initiative seeks to create a unified digital health ecosystem across India. A-B-H-A I-D serves as a digital repository for health information, granting patients control over their data and enabling them to share it securely with healthcare providers. The format might be seen like 'A-B-H-A colon one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two three four'."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, insurance companies also use identifiers such as the **Policy Number** and the **TPA ID (Third Party Administrator ID)**. Policy numbers often vary greatly in format but might look like 'ABC/123/2024/0001'. The TPA ID, which identifies the third-party administrator managing the insurance claim, is also important for processing medical bills. For instance, a patient insured under Star Health Insurance might have a policy number like 'SHI-2023-00001' and a TPA ID provided by their insurance provider.", "normalised": "Furthermore, insurance companies also use identifiers such as the **Policy Number** and the **T-P-A I-D (Third Party Administrator I-D)**.

The T-P-A I-D, which identifies the third-party administrator managing the insurance claim, is also important for processing medical bills. For instance, a patient insured under Star Health Insurance might have a policy number like 'S-H-I hyphen two thousand twenty three hyphen zero zero zero zero one' and a T-P-A I-D provided by their insurance provider."}
{"unnormalised": "Mediclaim cards themselves also have identifiers on them. Besides the policy number, there is often a card ID, such as 'MC-1234567'. This card ID is specific to the physical mediclaim card and can be used to verify the policy holder's details, especially useful in offline settings or as a quick reference for healthcare providers. Different insurance companies issue cards with a range of different formats, but these identifiers are crucial.", "normalised": "Mediclaim cards themselves also have identifiers on them.

{"unnormalised": "The correct usage and recording of these identifiers are critical for the success of India’s digital health initiatives. Healthcare providers must ensure accurate data entry and adhere to standardized formats to maintain data integrity. Incomplete or incorrect data can lead to delays in treatment, claim rejections, and hinder the overall efficiency of the healthcare system. Patients, on the other hand, should be aware of their healthcare identifiers and keep them readily accessible for healthcare interactions.", "normalised": "The correct usage and recording of these identifiers are critical for the success of India’s digital health initiatives.

{"unnormalised": "Looking forward, it is crucial to continue refining these identification systems and promote interoperability between different platforms. Data security and privacy remain paramount concerns. Robust measures should be implemented to safeguard sensitive patient information and prevent unauthorized access. With careful planning and diligent execution, healthcare identifiers can play a pivotal role in transforming India’s healthcare system, delivering better outcomes for all.", "normalised": "Looking forward, it is crucial to continue refining these identification systems and promote interoperability between different platforms.
