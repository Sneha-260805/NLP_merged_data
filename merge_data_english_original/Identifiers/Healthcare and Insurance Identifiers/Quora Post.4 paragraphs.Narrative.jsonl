{"unnormalised": "My father has a UHID: 123456789012, which I understand is a Unique Health ID. He got it when he visited Lilavati Hospital last year for a check-up related to his diabetes. The staff mentioned it helps them track his medical history across different visits. Apparently, it's linked to his Aadhaar card, though he hasn't officially linked them online yet. He also has a separate health insurance policy from ICICI Lombard, the policy number is HL/2023/000000.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, I want to know if these IDs are interchangeable. Can I use my father's UHID instead of his insurance policy number, or vice versa?
