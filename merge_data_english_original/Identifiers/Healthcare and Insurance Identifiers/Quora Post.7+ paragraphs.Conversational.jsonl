Instead of filling out tons of forms and trying to remember your entire medical history, you just give them your ABHA number (1234-5678-9012-34). They can then access your records securely, with your permission of course, giving them a much clearer picture of your health. It can help speed up diagnosis, reduce errors, and avoid unnecessary tests. Plus, it also has potential to improve the research in the long run.
