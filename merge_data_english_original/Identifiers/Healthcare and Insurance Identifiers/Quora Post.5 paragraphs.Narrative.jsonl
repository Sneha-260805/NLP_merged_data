My mother, Asha Devi, had a medical emergency, and navigating the insurance paperwork was a nightmare. We had her health insurance policy number which was a string of seemingly random characters like \"HD1234567890\", her Aadhaar no. which is \"XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ\", and then the hospital wanted her Unique Health Identification (UHID) number, which, if I remember correctly, started with \"MH\" followed by a long series of digits. It felt like we were drowning in numbers!", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about health identifiers. It is actually something my family went through a few years ago.

{"unnormalised": "The hospital registration desk kept asking for different IDs, and each seemed to be for a different purpose. We had her old insurance card with an expiry date of 07/2023, but they needed the updated policy details which, of course, I hadn't carried with me. They even asked if she had a CGHS card since she's a retired government teacher, but that had a different registration number altogether – something like \"CGHS/DL/12345\".

I mean, couldn't they just use her Aadhaar number \"XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ\" and pull up all her relevant healthcare information?", "normalised": "I distinctly remember the clerk asking, \"Madamji, what is your Central Government Health Scheme card number?\" and then proceeding to input it in a system that did not seem to talk to the health insurance system.

{"unnormalised": "I later learned that there are initiatives to create a more unified health ID system in India, something like the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. I haven't looked into it deeply, but the idea is to link all your health records to a single ID.
