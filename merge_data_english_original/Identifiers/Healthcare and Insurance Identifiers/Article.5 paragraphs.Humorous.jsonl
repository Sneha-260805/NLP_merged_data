{"unnormalised": "So, you’re trying to figure out your healthcare ID in India? Buckle up, buttercup, because it's less a smooth ride on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and more like navigating a crowded Delhi bazaar – chaotic, colourful, and you're probably going to get lost at least once. We're talking about a world where your Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID, sometimes displayed as ABHA-1234-5678-9012, coexists with your old Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) card (CGHS No. 12345), and possibly even a state-level scheme with its own alphanumeric monstrosity (like MH-MED-2023-00001). It’s a veritable alphabet soup of acronyms and numbers, guaranteed to induce a headache rivaling the worst summer heatstroke.", "normalised": "So, you’re trying to figure out your healthcare I-D in India?

{"unnormalised": "The humour, if you can call it that, lies in the sheer redundancy. You’d think in this digital age, we’d have ONE, unified healthcare ID to rule them all. But no. Instead, we have a proliferation of systems, each with its own logic (or lack thereof). Trying to explain to the pharmacist why your ABHA ID doesn't magically unlock your CGHS benefits is an exercise in futility, often resulting in a blank stare and a muttered, \"Sir, system down hai.\" My personal favorite? Trying to remember if my ESI (Employee’s State Insurance) number starts with 123456 or 654321 when the doctor asks for it. It feels like a daily quiz with high stakes – your health!", "normalised": "The humor, if you can call it that, lies in the sheer redundancy.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the joys of deciphering insurance cards. You've got your policy number (ICICI-LOMBARD-HLTH-2024-ABC123), your TPA ID (MediAssist-XYZ-9876), and a whole host of other numbers that seem designed to confuse rather than clarify. It’s like they’re intentionally trying to make it difficult to actually use your insurance.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the digital divide. While some folks are tech-savvy enough to manage all these IDs on their smartphones, many still rely on physical cards. And those cards? Prone to fading, tearing, and getting lost in the labyrinthine depths of wallets and handbags. Imagine a senior citizen trying to recall their Unique Disability ID (UDID: UP-2022-1234567) while standing in a long queue at AIIMS. It's a recipe for frustration and possibly a minor medical emergency of its own.", "normalised": "Then there's the digital divide.

{"unnormalised": "So, what's the solution? Honestly, I have no idea. Perhaps a government initiative to consolidate all these disparate systems into a single, user-friendly platform? Maybe a national awareness campaign on how to actually use these IDs? Or perhaps, we should just accept the chaos and embrace the absurdity of it all. After all, in India, a little bit of madness is par for the course. Just remember to carry a cheat sheet with all your healthcare IDs – you'll thank me later.
