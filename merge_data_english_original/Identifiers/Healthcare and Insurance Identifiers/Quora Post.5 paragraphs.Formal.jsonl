{"unnormalised": "In India's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, several identifiers play a crucial role in managing patient data and streamlining processes. One of the most prominent is the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID, a 14-digit number assigned to each citizen under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM). This acts as a unique identifier across various healthcare providers. You'll often see it written as something like: ABHA: 1234-5678-9012-34.", "normalised": "In India's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, several identifiers play a crucial role in managing patient data and streamlining processes.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond ABHA, various insurance schemes utilize their own identifiers. For instance, individuals enrolled in the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) scheme are assigned a unique ESI registration number. This number, often structured as something like 11-123456-78-9012, identifies the insured person and their entitlements under the scheme. Similarly, beneficiaries of the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are issued a CGHS card with a unique ID, perhaps looking like CGHS/DEL/12345.", "normalised": "Beyond A-B-H-A, various insurance schemes utilize their own identifiers.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, individual hospitals and healthcare institutions often maintain their own internal patient identification systems. A patient visiting AIIMS, for instance, may be assigned a unique Medical Record Number (MRN) specific to that institution. This number, possibly formatted as AIIMS/MRN/2024/00001, facilitates tracking of their medical history within that hospital's system. Even smaller clinics typically assign a unique number upon registration; Dr. Sharma's clinic might use a format such as DS/PT/0025.", "normalised": "Moreover, individual hospitals and healthcare institutions often maintain their own internal patient identification systems.
