{"unnormalised": "First, there was my own ABHA ID. My friendly neighbourhood doctor, Dr. Sharma, at City Hospital, insisted on it. Said it was \"for my own good.\" Apparently, it's supposed to link all my health records in one digital place. Sounds great, right? Except, I forgot my ABHA ID. I could only vaguely remember that it started with a \"14\" followed by a string of other seemingly random numbers. The process of retrieving it involved more clicks and OTPs than I care to remember. It was almost enough to make me forget about the cough.", "normalised": "First, there was my own A-B-H-A I-D. My friendly neighbourhood doctor, Doctor Sharma, at City Hospital, insisted on it.

{"unnormalised": "Then came the insurance card. My family's health policy with Star Health, policy no. STH/HLTH/2023/12345, looked simple enough. Until the lady at the billing counter asked me for the \"CGHS beneficiary ID.\" Apparently, my father's central government employee status meant there was *another* layer of ID to navigate. Turns out, my dad's CGHS card, with the ID 123456789012, was also needed for a special discount. Who knew healthcare came with so many secret levels?", "normalised": "Then came the insurance card.

{"unnormalised": "It didn't stop there. The hospital required a copy of my Aadhaar card, with its 12-digit number 4789 5643 2101, for \"identification purposes.\" As if my ABHA ID, insurance card, and general aura weren't enough. I’m starting to feel like a walking, talking barcode. Each ID, I was told, served a unique and vital function, a cog in the machine of providing affordable and accessible healthcare to all Indians.

{"unnormalised": "The next day, I decided to go for a second opinion at Global Health Clinic. This time, I was ready. ABHA ID memorised (mostly), insurance card laminated, Aadhaar copy fresh from the printer. I even had my father’s CGHS card downloaded on my phone. \"Bring it on,\" I muttered to myself.
