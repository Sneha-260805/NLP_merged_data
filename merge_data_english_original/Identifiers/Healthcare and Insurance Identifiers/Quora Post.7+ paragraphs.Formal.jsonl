{"unnormalised": "One of the most significant identifiers is the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) number, also known as the Unique Health ID (UHID). This 14-digit number serves as a single, unified identifier for individuals participating in the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) scheme. The ABHA number allows for seamless access to medical records across different healthcare facilities and enables the creation of a longitudinal health history for each individual. It is crucial to mention that older schemes may still refer to this as UHID: 1234-5678-9012-34.", "normalised": "One of the most significant identifiers is the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (A-B-H-A) number, also known as the Unique Health I-D (U-H-I-D).

{"unnormalised": "Another essential identifier is the State Health Agency (SHA) ID. This is a unique identifier assigned to beneficiaries by the respective state government under the AB PM-JAY scheme. Each state has its own system for generating and managing these IDs, which are often linked to the state's specific healthcare programs. An example might be SHA-KA-2023-00012345 for Karnataka. This is essential for the local level administration of health benefits.", "normalised": "Another essential identifier is the State Health Agency (S-H-A) I-D.

{"unnormalised": "Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) also plays a part in setting standards for identifiers, particularly concerning insurance policy numbers. While not a direct healthcare identifier, the policy number links patients to their insurance coverage, facilitating claims processing and reducing out-of-pocket expenses. One might see a policy number like IRDA/HLTH/2024/1234.", "normalised": "Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (I-R-D-A-I) also plays a part in setting standards for identifiers, particularly concerning insurance policy numbers.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, hospital-specific identifiers are widely used. Each hospital typically assigns a unique Medical Record Number (MRN) to every patient who receives care at their facility. This MRN allows the hospital to quickly retrieve patient records, track medical history, and ensure continuity of care within their system. For example, AIIMS Delhi might issue MRN: AIIMS-DEL-2024-000001.", "normalised": "Furthermore, hospital specific identifiers are widely used.

{"unnormalised": "The importance of these identifiers lies in their ability to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Indian healthcare system. They reduce the risk of errors in patient identification, prevent duplication of records, and facilitate data analysis for public health planning. By promoting interoperability and data standardization, these identifiers contribute to better patient outcomes and a more integrated healthcare ecosystem. Standardising the identifiers is particularly important when trying to analyse health trends in India from various sources.", "normalised": "The importance of these identifiers lies in their ability to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Indian healthcare system.

{"unnormalised": "The government's push for digitalization and the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) further underscores the significance of healthcare identifiers. As more healthcare providers transition to digital platforms, these identifiers will become increasingly critical for enabling seamless data exchange and ensuring the privacy and security of patient information. For instance, a doctor in Kerala should be able to access the ABHA-linked records of a patient who was previously treated in a hospital in Guwahati.", "normalised": "The government's push for digitalization and the adoption of electronic health records (E-H-R-s) further underscores the significance of healthcare identifiers.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, healthcare identifiers like the ABHA number, SHA ID, insurance policy numbers, and hospital MRNs are essential building blocks of a modern and efficient healthcare system in India. Their continued development and adoption will play a crucial role in improving patient care, enhancing data management, and strengthening the overall healthcare infrastructure. It is imperative that all stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers, recognize the importance of these identifiers and work together to ensure their effective implementation and utilization.", "normalised": "In conclusion, healthcare identifiers like the A-B-H-A number, S-H-A I-D, insurance policy numbers, and hospital M-R-N-s are essential building blocks of a modern and efficient healthcare system in India.
