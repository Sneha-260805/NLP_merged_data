{"unnormalised": "So, last month, my grandma, Dadi Lakshmi, needed to see a cardiologist for a checkup. She’s usually pretty sprightly for 80-something (she insists she’s still \"sweet sixteen at heart!\"), but she’d been complaining about some chest pain. Booking the appointment wasn’t too bad; Apollo Hospital uses a pretty slick online system. But then came the fun part – the insurance!", "normalised": "so, last month, my grandma, Dadi Lakshmi, needed to see a cardiologist for a checkup. she’s usually pretty sprightly for eighty something (she insists she’s still \"sweet sixteen at heart!\"), but she’d been complaining about some chest pain. booking the appointment wasn’t too bad; Apollo Hospital uses a pretty slick online system. but then came the fun part – the insurance!"}
{"unnormalised": "Dadi Lakshmi has a senior citizen health insurance policy with Star Health, policy no. STH/2023/00789. Seems simple enough, right? Wrong. First, they needed her Aadhaar number, 9876-5432-1012, to verify her identity. Then, they asked for her Unique Health ID (UHID), which apparently is something different altogether. I didn’t even know she *had* a UHID! Turns out, it was printed on some old document from her last hospital visit – a string of numbers and letters: ABHA-123-456-7890-1234.

{"unnormalised": "The poor chap at the insurance desk looked just as frazzled as I did. He explained that each ID serves a different purpose – Aadhaar for identity, UHID for a centralized health record (supposedly!), CGHS for her government benefits, and the insurance policy number for, well, the insurance policy itself. It still felt incredibly redundant and confusing.", "normalised": "the poor chap at the insurance desk looked just as frazzled as i did. he explained that each I-D serves a a different purpose – Aadhaar for identity, U-H-I-D for a centralized health record (supposedly!), C-G-H-S for her government benefits, and the insurance policy number for, well, the insurance policy itself. it still felt incredibly redundant and confusing."}
{"unnormalised": "I started wondering if there’s a better way to manage all these healthcare identifiers. Maybe a single, universal ID linked to all our health information? Or at least, a system that’s easier for us common folk to understand.

Thankfully, the cardiologist said her heart was strong as an ox (her words, not mine!), just needed a bit of medication and some rest. But the whole experience left me thinking – surely there’s got to be a simpler, less ID-intensive way to navigate India's healthcare system! Here’s hoping for a smoother process next time.", "normalised": "anyway, after what felt like an eternity of paperwork and I-D-number-wrangling, we finally got Dadi Lakshmi checked in. thankfully, the cardiologist said her heart was strong as an ox (her words, not mine!), just needed a bit of medication and some rest. but the whole experience left me thinking – surely there’s got to be a simpler, less I-D-intensive way to navigate India's healthcare system! here’s hoping for a smoother process next time."}
