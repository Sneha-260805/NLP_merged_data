{"unnormalised": "One of the most important identifiers is the UHID, or Unique Health Identification number. Many hospitals, especially larger ones like AIIMS or Apollo, now assign a UHID to each patient. It's often a 12-digit number (e.g., 123456789012) that helps them track your medical history across different departments and visits. This is way better than the old system where you'd have to carry a thick file of reports every time! For instance, Dr. Sharma can easily access Priya Kumar’s medical records if she has a UHID on file. This identifier ensures that all healthcare providers can have access to consistent and accurate medical information, ultimately improving the quality of care.", "normalised": "One of the most important identifiers is the U-H-I-D, or Unique Health Identification number.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the world of health insurance. Whether you have a private policy from ICICI Lombard or are covered under a government scheme like Ayushman Bharat, you'll have a unique policy number. For example, your Star Health policy number might look something like STHL/2024/123456. Knowing this number is vital when filing claims or seeking cashless treatment. Always keep it handy, especially when you’re at a network hospital! Remember to renew it on time too – policies often lapse after 365 days from the start date.", "normalised": "Then there's the world of health insurance.

{"unnormalised": "Talking about government schemes, Ayushman Bharat uses a unique identifier too. This often involves linking your Aadhaar number (e.g., 1234-5678-9012) to your health records to verify eligibility and streamline access to services. This is supposed to help reduce fraud and ensure that the benefits reach the intended recipients. However, privacy concerns are valid, so do your research before sharing your Aadhaar.
