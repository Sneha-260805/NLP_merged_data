{"unnormalised": "One of the most frequently encountered identifiers is the UHID, or Unique Hospital Identification Number. This number, typically assigned by individual hospitals, serves as a primary key for accessing a patient's medical records within that specific institution. For example, a patient might have UHID \"AHD123456\" at Apollo Hospitals, Delhi, and a completely different UHID at AIIMS, New Delhi. The format of the UHID can vary widely, often including a combination of alphanumeric characters.", "normalised": "One of the most frequently encountered identifiers is the U-H-I-D, or Unique Hospital Identification Number. This number, typically assigned by individual hospitals, serves as a primary key for accessing a patient's medical records within that specific institution. For example, a patient might have U-H-I-D \"A-H-D one two three four five six\" at Apollo Hospitals, Delhi, and a completely different U-H-I-D at A-I-I-M-S, New Delhi. The format of the U-H-I-D can vary widely, often including a combination of alphanumeric characters."}
{"unnormalised": "Beyond the UHID, various insurance schemes contribute to the identifier ecosystem. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), for instance, assigns a unique beneficiary ID to eligible individuals. This PMJAY ID, potentially formatted as \"12345678901234\", facilitates access to cashless treatment at empanelled hospitals across the country. Understanding the PMJAY ID is crucial for both patients and healthcare providers seeking to leverage the benefits of this national health insurance scheme.", "normalised": "Beyond the U-H-I-D, various insurance schemes contribute to the identifier ecosystem.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, individual health insurance policies also generate policy numbers that act as identifiers. A policy number like \"ICICI/HLT/2023/000123\" is specific to a particular insurance company and plan. This identifier is vital for claims processing and determining the extent of coverage available to the insured. The presence of unnormalized elements like the insurer's abbreviation adds complexity, demanding normalization for seamless data integration.", "normalised": "Furthermore, individual health insurance policies also generate policy numbers that act as identifiers.

{"unnormalised": "Adding another layer, doctors and healthcare professionals are also identified through unique registration numbers issued by medical councils. A doctor registered with the Medical Council of India (MCI), for example, would possess a registration number such as \"MCI/2020/12345\", while a dentist would have a similar registration number from the Dental Council of India. These numbers are essential for verifying the credentials of healthcare providers.", "normalised": "Adding another layer, doctors and healthcare professionals are also identified through unique registration numbers issued by medical councils.

{"unnormalised": "The Aadhaar number, while not strictly a healthcare identifier, often plays a role in verifying patient identity and linking disparate healthcare records. Although its primary purpose is broader, the 12-digit Aadhaar number \"1234 5678 9012\" is increasingly used across sectors, including healthcare, to establish a unified identity. Its integration into healthcare systems raises important considerations regarding data privacy and security.", "normalised": "The Aadhaar number, while not strictly a healthcare identifier, often plays a role in verifying patient identity and linking disparate healthcare records.

{"unnormalised": "The complexity of the current identifier landscape underscores the need for standardization and interoperability. Multiple unnormalized formats create challenges for data exchange and analysis, potentially hindering efforts to improve healthcare outcomes. A standardized system would facilitate the creation of comprehensive patient histories, enabling better informed clinical decision-making.", "normalised": "The complexity of the current identifier landscape underscores the need for standardization and interoperability.
