{"unnormalised": "In the ever-entertaining saga of Indian healthcare, where finding a vacant bed is akin to winning the lottery, let's talk about identifiers! Not just any identifiers, mind you, but the glorious alphanumeric soup that defines your existence in the eyes of hospitals and insurance companies. Forget your name, forget your face; it's your UHID (Unique Health Identification Number), your ABHA ID (Ayushman Bharat Health Account ID), and your insurance policy no. that truly matters. It's like having a secret code, but instead of unlocking a treasure, it unlocks... the privilege of potentially bankrupting yourself for a slightly less terrible hospital experience.", "normalised": "In the ever-entertaining saga of Indian healthcare, where finding a vacant bed is akin to winning the lottery, let's talk about identifiers!

{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the UHID. Think of it as your healthcare passport, a magical sequence of numbers and letters that supposedly streamlines your medical journey. In reality, it often feels like another hurdle in the already obstacle-ridden race to get seen by a doctor. You'll be asked for it 7 times before you even reach the reception desk. Some hospitals are still stuck in the era of the Mahabharata and ask for it written out in triplicate. It's usually a number like HOS/2024/GH/007. Don't lose that golden goose... i mean number!", "normalised": "Let's start with the U-H-I-D.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the ABHA ID, the government's ambitious attempt to create a centralized health record system. The goal is noble: a single digital locker for all your medical history. The reality? Well, let's just say it's still under construction, much like that flyover in your neighbourhood that's been \"almost done\" for the past 5 years. Imagine a system where your medical records include details like \"Suffered a severe burn after attempting to make gulab jamun\".

{"unnormalised": "And of course, the grand finale: your health insurance policy number. This alphanumeric masterpiece determines whether you'll be discharged with a manageable debt or a life sentence of EMIs. Getting that pre-authorization feels like auditioning for a reality TV show.
