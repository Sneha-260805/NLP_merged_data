{"unnormalised": "The integration of these disparate identifiers poses significant challenges. A patient visiting AIIMS Delhi may have an ABHA number, a past hospital registration number (MRN12345), and a private health insurance policy with a separate ID. Linking these records requires sophisticated algorithms capable of recognizing and normalizing the different formats. Moreover, legacy systems in older hospitals often use outdated methods, such as relying solely on patient names and addresses, which can lead to inaccuracies.", "normalised": "The integration of these disparate identifiers poses significant challenges.

{"unnormalised": "Normalization models are essential for addressing these inconsistencies. These models must be trained to recognize and standardize various identifier formats, including ABHA numbers, insurance policy numbers, hospital registration numbers, and even legacy identifiers. The goal is to create a unified patient record that consolidates information from different sources, facilitating better clinical decision-making and reducing administrative burden. The development and deployment of such models represent a critical step towards a more efficient and patient-centric healthcare system in India.", "normalised": "Normalization models are essential for addressing these inconsistencies.
