This PNR serves as a master record containing all the details related to a passenger's itinerary, including flight dates, times, passenger names, contact information, and any special requests (e.g., meal preferences or wheelchair assistance). For example, if Priya Sharma booked a flight from Delhi to Mumbai, her PNR might be something like \"DELBOM\".
