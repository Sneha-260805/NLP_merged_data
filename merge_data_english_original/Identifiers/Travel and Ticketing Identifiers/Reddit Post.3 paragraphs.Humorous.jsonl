He’s super proud of scoring confirmed tix on the Rajdhani Express. Fine. Here's the kicker - he's plastered the PNR (like, *all* the PNRs) all over our family WhatsApp group. I mean, seriously?! He even wrote a caption: \"Dekho, sab ticket confirm hai! PNR dekho!\" with 10 laughing emojis.", "normalised": "So, quick backstory: My chacha, Rajesh Sharma, booked a whole bunch of train tickets for our family trip to Rajasthan next month.

{"unnormalised": "Now, my cousin, Priya (his daughter), wants *my* individual PNR. Apparently, chacha is making some grand excel sheet itinerary, color-coded and all, and needs everyone’s individual ticket details, including my IRCTC User ID (which I also used to book another ticket, and he KNOWS it). I told her, \"Dude, it's already on WhatsApp, just scroll up!\" But noooo, she insists I send it to her directly. Says it's \"easier\" for chacha. I'm sketched out, y'all. Sounds like prime identity theft territory. I feel like I'm being asked for my freaking Aadhaar number (which btw is 9876 5432 1011). AITA for refusing to hand it over? I suggested he just uses the main PNR on the WhatsApp group that *HE* posted, but apparently that's too difficult for his \"master itinerary\".", "normalised": "Now, my cousin, Priya (his daughter), wants my individual P-N-R.
