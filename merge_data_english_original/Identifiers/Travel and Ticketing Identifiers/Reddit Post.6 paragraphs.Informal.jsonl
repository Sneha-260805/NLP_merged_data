{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, need some help with a PNR number issue. Booked a flight on Indigo (6E) for the family to Goa for Diwali, and the booking confirmation has two different PNRs listed! One is like 'PNR: ABCDEFG' at the top, which I think is the main one? And then there's another one lower down, looks like 'Amadeus Ref: 123XYZ', whatever that means. Anyone else faced this before? Which PNR do I use for web check-in and stuff? Don't wanna end up stranded at the airport with the kids, haha.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some help with a P-N-R number issue.

{"unnormalised": "Checked the Indigo website, and it's asking for \"Booking Reference\" or \"PNR\". So, I entered the ABCDEFG one, and it seems to recognize the booking – shows our names, flight details for 24/10/2024, the works. But I'm still a bit paranoid because of the two different references. Should I just stick with the ABCDEFG one since the Indigo site recognizes it? Or is there something special about the Amadeus Ref: 123XYZ that I'm missing?", "normalised": "Checked the Indigo website, and it's asking for \"Booking Reference\" or \"P-N-R\".

{"unnormalised": "Also, a related q – anyone know if Indigo lets you select seats for free during web check-in now? Last time I flew with them, like a yr ago, they were charging extra for everything! Trying to avoid paying extra if possible, since the flight itself cost a bomb! Need to snag window seats for the kids, otherwise, they’ll be cranky the whole 2 hr flight.", "normalised": "Also, a related question – anyone know if Indigo lets you select seats for free during web check-in now?

I know the beaches are the main attraction, but anything else that's kid-friendly? Maybe some good restaurants with kid-friendly menus?
