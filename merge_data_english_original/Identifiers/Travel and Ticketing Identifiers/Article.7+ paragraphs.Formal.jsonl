{"unnormalised": "Currently, a multitude of systems are used for identifying passengers, bookings, and tickets. Airlines often employ Passenger Name Records (PNRs) consisting of alphanumeric codes like 'BC73X9' while railway ticketing relies on different formats such as the 10-digit PNRs used by IRCTC (e.g., '2345678901'). Bus services might use entirely different internal booking references. This lack of uniformity presents challenges for data reconciliation, inter-agency communication, and streamlined customer service. Hotel bookings, for instance, might reference confirmation numbers that don't easily link with flight itineraries or train schedules. Even within a single sector, different airlines utilize diverse PNR structures, complicating code-sharing agreements and baggage handling.", "normalised": "Currently, a multitude of systems are used for identifying passengers, bookings, and tickets.

{"unnormalised": "One of the most prominent challenges stems from the potential for data errors and inconsistencies. Manual data entry and disparate systems contribute to inaccuracies in passenger information, potentially leading to boarding denials or lost baggage. The reliance on different formats for loyalty program memberships (e.g., frequent flyer numbers, hotel rewards identifiers) further complicates matters. Consider a scenario where a traveler provides their 'ABC12345' airline loyalty number but it gets incorrectly entered as 'ABCL2345' due to a typographical error or system limitation. Such errors impact the traveler's ability to accrue points and access associated benefits.", "normalised": "One of the most prominent challenges stems from the potential for data errors and inconsistencies.

{"unnormalised": "The standardization of travel identifiers could lead to significant improvements in operational efficiency. A uniform identifier system would streamline data exchange between airlines, hotels, travel agencies, and other service providers. This would facilitate automated check-in processes, enhance baggage tracking, and reduce the incidence of data errors. For example, the implementation of a standardized format for booking references could simplify the process of linking flight reservations with hotel bookings, allowing travel agencies to provide more comprehensive and personalized itineraries.", "normalised": "The standardization of travel identifiers could lead to significant improvements in operational efficiency.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, standardized identifiers can contribute to enhanced security. A unified system can improve the ability to track passenger movements and identify potential security threats. Linking passport numbers (e.g., 'P12345678') to travel itineraries in a standardized manner allows for more effective screening and risk assessment. This is particularly crucial in the context of international travel, where coordinated security efforts are essential. Consider the scenario where a traveler books a flight using passport 'Q98765432' and subsequently makes a hotel reservation; a standardized identifier system would enable seamless matching of these records, facilitating enhanced security checks.", "normalised": "Furthermore, standardized identifiers can contribute to enhanced security.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond operational efficiencies and security enhancements, travel identifier standardization offers substantial benefits for the customer experience. A unified system allows for personalized service delivery and proactive communication. Travel providers can leverage standardized identifiers to track customer preferences, anticipate their needs, and provide tailored recommendations. Imagine a traveler who frequently books flights with airline code 'AI' and stays at hotels within the 'Taj' group; a standardized identifier system could enable travel agencies to proactively offer them exclusive deals and customized itineraries based on their past travel behavior. Moreover, linking Aadhaar numbers (e.g., '1234 5678 9012') to travel bookings could enable quicker verification and reduced wait times at airports and other travel hubs.", "normalised": "Beyond operational efficiencies and security enhancements, travel identifier standardization offers substantial benefits for the customer experience.
