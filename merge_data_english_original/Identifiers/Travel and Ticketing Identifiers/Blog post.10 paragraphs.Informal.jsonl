{"unnormalised": "First off, what's a PNR anyway? PNR stands for Passenger Name Record. It's a 10-digit alphanumeric code (like ABC12D3EFG) given to you when you book a flight or train ticket. Think of it as your personal booking ID. It's linked to all your travel details: your name, flight/train number, date of travel, seat number (if confirmed), and even your meal preference (if you're lucky enough to have one!). You'll usually find this printed on your e-ticket or mentioned in the SMS you get after booking.", "normalised": "First off, what's a P-N-R anyway? P-N-R stands for Passenger Name Record.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the booking reference number. Sometimes, this is used interchangeably with PNR, especially for flights. But, airlines might also use a slightly different system. Just keep an eye out for something that looks like a jumble of letters and numbers; that's probably it. In the Indian Railways, you might also come across a Transaction ID alongside the PNR, especially if you booked online via IRCTC. It might look something like TXN1234567890. This is mostly for your reference in case of payment issues.", "normalised": "Then there's the booking reference number. Sometimes, this is used interchangeably with P-N-R, especially for flights.

{"unnormalised": "Why are these important? Well, for starters, you need them to check your booking status online. Websites like MakeMyTrip or IRCTC ask for your PNR to pull up your ticket details. Super handy for confirming everything's in order a few days before you travel. Also, if your flight gets delayed (because, let's be honest, delays happen), you'll need your PNR to rebook or claim compensation.", "normalised": "Why are these important?
