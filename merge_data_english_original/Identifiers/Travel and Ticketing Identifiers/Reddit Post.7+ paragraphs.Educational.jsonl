{"unnormalised": "**Topic: Decoding PNRs, Ticket Numbers, and Other Travel IDs in India**", "normalised": "First up, the P-N-R (Passenger Name Record). This is a ten-digit number (sometimes just numbers, sometimes a mix) that you'll find on your train or flight ticket after booking. For example, a P-N-R might look like this: four hundred and thirty hyphen six million seven hundred and eighty nine thousand one hundred and twenty three. Think of it as your booking's master key. It confirms that your booking exists in the airline's or I-R-C-T-C's (Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation) system. You can use this P-N-R to check your booking status online, confirm your seat allocation (if any), and even order food on some trains. Don't lose it!"}

It can be confusing!", "normalised": "Next, let's talk about ticket numbers. These are typically longer than P-N-Rs. For an Air India flight, a ticket number will often start with 'zero ninety eight' followed by a ten-digit number, something like zero ninety eight hyphen one billion two hundred and thirty four million five hundred and sixty seven thousand eight hundred and ninety. These are unique to each individual ticket, not just the overall booking. On Indian Railways, you usually get a ticket number printed on the ticket itself after booking at the counter. It is also a ten-digit number. It might be used for specific enquiries relating to that passenger. If you are doing a web check-in, you will be asked for this number."}
{"unnormalised": "First up, the PNR (Passenger Name Record). This is a 10-digit number (sometimes just numbers, sometimes a mix) that you'll find on your train or flight ticket after booking.

It confirms that your booking exists in the airline's or IRCTC's (Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation) system.

Airlines and I-R-C-T-C often ask for I-D proof at the time of booking and or travel. While Aadhaar isn’t mandatory (at least not always!), providing your Aadhaar number can sometimes speed up the process. So, you might see a field for a twelve digit Aadhaar Number, something like: one thousand two hundred and thirty four five thousand six hundred and seventy eight nine thousand and twelve. Other accepted I-Ds include P-A-N cards (a ten-character alphanumeric code), Voter I-D (with an E-P-I-C number like X-Y-Z-one-two-three-four-five-six-seven), and of course, your passport (a combination of letters and numbers, e.g., A-B-one-two-three-four-five-six-seven). Airlines are now mandating passengers carry a copy of their I-D's when travelling."}
