Imagine the scene: she rocks up to the IndiGo counter at the last minute, flustered and waving her phone like a frantic conductor, only to be told, \"Madam, that's not a PNR, that's a search query!\" Her actual PNR was hidden in a WhatsApp message from her travel agent, a travel agency with the code 6E337, buried under a mountain of forwarded jokes.", "normalised": "Then there's my friend, Priya.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the hunt for your PNR number, flight reference, or even a simple ticket ID is a shared human experience, filled with frustration, momentary despair, and, occasionally, the sweet relief of finding it lurking in the unlikeliest of places. Next time you find yourself searching for that elusive code, take a deep breath, check your spam folder, and maybe, just maybe, ask your chacha for help.
