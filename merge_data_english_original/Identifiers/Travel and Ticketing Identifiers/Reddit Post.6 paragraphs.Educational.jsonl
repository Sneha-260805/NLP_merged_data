{"unnormalised": "First, let's talk about the PNR, or Passenger Name Record. This is a 10-digit number (it can vary from 8-10 digits actually, older systems use 8) that is generated by the airline or railway reservation system. Its main purpose is to contain all the information related to your booking, such as your name, contact details, seat number, travel dates, and train/flight number. Think of it as the master record for your entire trip. You can usually find it printed prominently on your e-ticket after you book.", "normalised": "First, let's talk about the P-N-R, or Passenger Name Record.

{"unnormalised": "Now, the ticket ID is a bit different. This is usually a shorter, alphanumeric code assigned to your individual ticket. On an IRCTC train ticket, it might look something like 231234567890. Airlines also use ticket numbers, often starting with a few digits identifying the airline (like 125- for Air India) followed by several more numbers. The ticket ID represents your specific authorization to travel on that train or flight. So, even if several people are travelling under one PNR (family bookings, group bookings), each person will have their own unique ticket ID.", "normalised": "Now, the ticket I-D is a bit different.

{"unnormalised": "The key difference is this: the PNR is the booking record, while the ticket ID is the travel authorization for a specific individual. You can use the PNR to check your booking status, get confirmation, or make changes. The ticket ID is typically used for boarding passes, in-flight purchases, or to resolve issues during your journey at specific checkpoints or stations. For example, if you lose your luggage, knowing your ticket ID, 9876543210, might help the airline track it more efficiently, as it's directly linked to your passenger profile.", "normalised": "The key difference is this: the P-N-R is the booking record, while the ticket I-D is the travel authorization for a specific individual.
