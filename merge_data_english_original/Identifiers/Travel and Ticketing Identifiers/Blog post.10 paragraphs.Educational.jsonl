{"unnormalised": "First up, let's tackle PNRs. A PNR, or Passenger Name Record, is a 6-character alphanumeric code like \"6YZ8AB\" or \"2RE9CD.\" This is your booking reference number, essentially a digital file containing all your travel details – your name, flight/train details, contact information, and payment status. You'll typically find your PNR printed on your e-ticket or reservation confirmation. Always keep this number handy; it's your key to accessing and managing your booking online or with the airline/railway company.", "normalised": "First up, let us tackle P-N-Rs. A P-N-R, or Passenger Name Record, is a six character alphanumeric code like \"six Y-Z eight A-B\" or \"two R-E nine C-D\".

You will typically find your P-N-R printed on your e-ticket or reservation confirmation. Always keep this number handy; it is your key to accessing and managing your booking online or with the airline slash railway company."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, we have ticket numbers. Typically, these are a long series of digits, such as \"125-6789012345\" for air travel, or a shorter numerical code for train tickets. Think of it as the unique serial number assigned to your specific ticket. While the PNR identifies your overall booking, the ticket number identifies your individual passage.", "normalised": "Next, we have ticket numbers. Typically, these are a long series of digits, such as \"one hundred and twenty five dash six hundred and seventy eight million nine hundred and one thousand two hundred and thirty four five\" for air travel, or a shorter numerical code for train tickets. Think of it as the unique serial number assigned to your specific ticket. While the P-N-R identifies your overall booking, the ticket number identifies your individual passage."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there are flight numbers. Every flight is assigned a unique flight number, typically consisting of a 2-letter airline code followed by a 3 or 4-digit number, for instance, \"AI101\" (Air India) or \"6E202\" (IndiGo). This code helps air traffic control, airport staff, and passengers track the flight's progress from departure to arrival. So, when you hear an announcement saying \"Flight AI101 to Delhi is now boarding at Gate 4,\" you know exactly which flight they're referring to.", "normalised": "Then there are flight numbers.

So, when you hear an announcement saying \"Flight A-I one hundred and one to Delhi is now boarding at Gate four,\" you know exactly which flight they are referring to."}
{"unnormalised": "Train numbers also play a vital role. Similar to flight numbers, train numbers are usually a 5-digit number like \"12001\" (Bhopal Shatabdi Express) or \"12841\" (Coromandel Express). This number helps to identify the train's route, frequency, and stops. Knowing the train number is essential for checking its live running status, platform number, and arrival/departure times.", "normalised": "Train numbers also play a vital role. Similar to flight numbers, train numbers are usually a five digit number like \"twelve thousand and one\" (Bhopal Shatabdi Express) or \"twelve thousand eight hundred and forty one\" (Coromandel Express). This number helps to identify the train's route, frequency, and stops. Knowing the train number is essential for checking its live running status, platform number, and arrival slash departure times."}
{"unnormalised": "Bus ticket identifiers vary more widely depending on the operator, but often involve a combination of letters and numbers, such as \"SRS-12345\" or \"TNSTC-A6789\". These codes help to identify your specific bus journey, seat assignment, and boarding location.", "normalised": "Bus ticket identifiers vary more widely depending on the operator, but often involve a combination of letters and numbers, such as \"S-R-S dash twelve thousand three hundred and forty five\" or \"T-N-S-T-C dash A six thousand seven hundred and eighty nine\".

{"unnormalised": "Understanding location codes is equally important. Airports worldwide are assigned a unique 3-letter IATA code (e.g., \"DEL\" for Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, \"BOM\" for Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). These codes simplify communication and identification of airports in booking systems and baggage tags. Railway stations also have codes, though they are typically shorter, like \"NDLS\" for New Delhi.", "normalised": "Understanding location codes is equally important. Airports worldwide are assigned a unique three letter I-A-T-A code (e.g., \"D-E-L\" for Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, \"B-O-M\" for Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). These codes simplify communication and identification of airports in booking systems and baggage tags. Railway stations also have codes, though they are typically shorter, like \"N-D-L-S\" for New Delhi."}
{"unnormalised": "Also important are seat numbers. Whether you're on a plane, train, or bus, your seat number is usually indicated by a letter and a number (e.g., \"A3\", \"45B\"), specifying your assigned seating location.
