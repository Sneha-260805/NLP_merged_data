{"unnormalised": "First off, train travel is a quintessential Indian experience. The PNR, or Passenger Name Record, is your golden ticket here. You'll find this 10-digit number (e.g., 1234567890) on your e-ticket or printed reservation slip. Keep this PNR handy, as it’s essential for checking your reservation status, tracking your train, and even claiming refunds if needed.
