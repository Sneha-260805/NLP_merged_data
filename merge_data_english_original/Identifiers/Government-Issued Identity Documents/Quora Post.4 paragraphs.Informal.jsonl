{"unnormalised": "First off, your Voter ID (officially called an EPIC card) is primarily for voting, obviously. You'll need this, plus address proof, to cast your vote.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's Aadhaar. This 12-digit number (e.g., 1234 5678 9012) is more like a general identity and address proof. You can use it for everything from opening a bank account to getting a new SIM card. Govt loves it coz it's linked to biometrics, making it harder to fake.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, PAN (Permanent Account Number) is essential for anything finance-related, you know, taxes and stuff. It's a 10-character alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department (e.g., ABCDE1234F). It's not really an ID proof like the others, but more for tracking financial transactions, so don't use it for address proof. And driving license, well, that's pretty straightforward. Its primary purpose is to show you're legally allowed to drive, and it also acts as an ID & address proof, but only if it has your correct address on it.

It's not really an I-D proof like the others, but more for tracking financial transactions, so don't use it for address proof. And driving license, well, that's pretty straightforward.
