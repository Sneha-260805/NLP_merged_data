Except, I needed to update my KYC. \"Aadhaar card, please,\" the teller said, with that practiced, slightly-impatient smile they all seem to have.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I managed to update my mobile number. Reprints take approximately 5 working days, and cost Rs. 50.
