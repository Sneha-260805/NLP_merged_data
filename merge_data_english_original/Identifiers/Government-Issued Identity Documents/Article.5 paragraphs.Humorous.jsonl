It all started innocently enough with Mrs. Sharma needing to link her mobile number to her Aadhaar card, number 2345-6789-0123. She rifled through her purse, the cupboard, even under little Rohan's bed (which, let’s be honest, is a black hole of lost socks and ancient snacks). The elusive Aadhaar card?

Only ₹50, I think.” But Mrs. Sharma, a firm believer in Murphy’s Law, was convinced this was the start of a bureaucratic nightmare. She envisioned endless queues, forms filled in triplicate, and stern-faced officials demanding documents she didn’t even know existed.

The entire family was drafted into \"Operation Find Aadhaar.\" Rohan, bribed with the promise of extra screen time, diligently checked under the sofa cushions.

Maybe you left it there after praying for Rohan’s exam results!\" She remembered getting a duplicate card made once, the application number was something like APPL/2023/1234567890.
