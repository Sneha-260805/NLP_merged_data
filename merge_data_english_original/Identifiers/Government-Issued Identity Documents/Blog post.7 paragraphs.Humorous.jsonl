{"unnormalised": "Alright folks, buckle up, because we're diving headfirst into the wonderfully weird world of Indian government IDs. It’s a jungle out there, a bureaucratic safari if you will, and navigating it can feel like trying to find a decent signal in a basement… in Manali. Let’s be honest, who hasn’t felt the mild panic when asked for their PAN card during a seemingly innocent transaction? Or the sheer dread of remembering which document you used as proof of address *last* time?", "normalised": "Alright folks, buckle up, because we're diving headfirst into the wonderfully weird world of Indian government I-D's.

My fingerprints have been rejected so many times, I'm convinced the machines think I'm a highly sophisticated robot trying to infiltrate the system. My Aadhaar No. is 9876 5432 1012, by the way.

{"unnormalised": "Then we have the PAN card. That little laminated rectangle of doom and taxes. It’s essential for anything involving money and even for some things that don't involve money. It feels like it should grant me superpowers but alas all it grants are opportunities to pay taxes.
