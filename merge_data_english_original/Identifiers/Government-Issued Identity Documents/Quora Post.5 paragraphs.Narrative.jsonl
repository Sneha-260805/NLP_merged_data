Applied online, pretty straightforward form asking for details like name, address, DOB (24/06/1988), etc. Uploaded copies of my Class 10 marksheet and voter ID as proof.

The lady at the counter keyed in my Aadhaar No. (4567-8901-2345), took my fingerprints, and an eye scan. Phew, thought I was done.", "normalised": "First, the Aadhaar.
