{"unnormalised": "Seriously though, it seems like every other week I'm asked for a new ID. First, there's the usual suspects: Aadhaar (of course), PAN card (essential for anything financial), and voter ID (gotta vote, right?). Then you start getting into the job-specific stuff. My friend Priya, who's a teacher, needed some \"Teacher ID\" from the state board - something about tracking professional development, I think. And my cousin Rakesh, who works in IT, keeps talking about his employee ID and some kind of project-specific ID that changes every few months!
