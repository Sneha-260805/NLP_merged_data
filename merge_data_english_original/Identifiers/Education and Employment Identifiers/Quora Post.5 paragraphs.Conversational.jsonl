{"unnormalised": "Think about it – how many Priya Sharmas or Rakesh Kumars do you know? Probably more than a few, right? When it comes to education, a standardized Student ID, like a roll number or a unique code (e.g., SCH12345), helps schools track academic progress, attendance, and other important info without getting confused between two students with the same name. Plus, when applying for higher studies or scholarships, having this ID simplifies the verification process a lot. No more running around trying to prove you're the \"correct\" Priya Sharma!", "normalised": "Think about it – how many Priya Sharmas or Rakesh Kumars do you know? Probably more than a few, right?

{"unnormalised": "Similarly, for employees, a unique Employee ID (like EMP007) issued by companies, or even something government-mandated like a Universal Account Number (UAN) for PF, makes things much easier. Imagine a large company like TCS or Infosys trying to manage lakhs of employees without a clear identifier. Payroll, attendance, performance reviews – everything would be a nightmare. The UAN, specifically, allows employees to easily transfer their PF account when switching jobs, regardless of the employer or location.", "normalised": "Similarly, for employees, a unique Employee I-D (like E-M-P zero zero seven) issued by companies, or even something government-mandated like a Universal Account Number (U-A-N) for P-F, makes things much easier.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the practical benefits, these identifiers also play a role in data security and privacy. By assigning a unique code instead of relying solely on personal details like name and date of birth (e.g., 15/08/1947), we reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud. This is especially important in today's digital age, where data breaches are becoming increasingly common.", "normalised": "Beyond the practical benefits, these identifiers also play a role in data security and privacy.
