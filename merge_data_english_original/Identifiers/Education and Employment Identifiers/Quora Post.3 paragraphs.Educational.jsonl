{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me what the purpose of an AISHE code is, so here's my take. The AISHE code, or All India Survey on Higher Education code, is basically a unique identifier assigned to colleges and institutions of higher learning across India. Think of it like your Aadhaar number, but for your college! The MHRD, now the Ministry of Education, uses this code to track and analyze data related to higher education institutions.", "normalised": "Someone asked me what the purpose of an A-I-S-H-E code is, so here's my take.

{"unnormalised": "Why does the govt need this? Well, the AISHE code helps the ministry gather crucial info. It's used to track enrollment numbers, faculty details, infrastructure availability, and research output. All this data is essential for policy-making and resource allocation. Plus, having a unique identifier makes it easier to maintain accurate records and prevent duplication. You can usually find it displayed prominently on a college's website or prospectus, sometimes abbreviated as 'AISHE Code' or ‘Inst Code’. If you're applying for any scholarship or govt. scheme through your college, you’ll likely need to provide it. For example, ABC College of Engineering, Coimbatore might have the AISHE Code C-47892.", "normalised": "Why does the government need this?

Students usually don't have to worry too much about it directly, but it plays a vital role behind the scenes. Similarly, your PAN card (e.g., ABCDE1234F) or employee ID at TCS (say, EMP12345) are for tracking and identification purposes within specific systems.", "normalised": "In short, the A-I-S-H-E code (example: U hyphen D-L zero four seven one) is an important tool for streamlining and improving the higher education system in India.
