So basically, an Employee ID is what your company gives you, like TCS12345 or INFY67890. It's unique to you within that organization. You'll find it on your payslip, offer letter, etc. It helps HR track you in their system.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about the difference between Employee I-D and U-A-N number. I thought I'd share my understanding. So basically, an Employee I-D is what your company gives you, like T-C-S one two three four five or I-N-F-Y six seven eight nine zero. It's unique to you within that organization. You'll find it on your payslip, offer letter, etcetera. It helps H-R track you in their system."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, a UAN number (Universal Account Number) is different. It's given by the EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation), and it's like a permanent account number for your PF. Even if you switch jobs from say, Wipro to HCL, your UAN stays the same. So, you might have multiple Employee IDs over your career, but only 1 UAN. You need this UAN to access your PF account online, check your balance, and eventually withdraw your money after retirement.", "normalised": "Now, a U-A-N number (Universal Account Number) is different. It's given by the E-P-F-O (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation), and it's like a permanent account number for your P-F. Even if you switch jobs from say, Wipro to H-C-L, your U-A-N stays the same. So, you might have multiple Employee I-Ds over your career, but only one U-A-N. You need this U-A-N to access your P-F account online, check your balance, and eventually withdraw your money after retirement."}
{"unnormalised": "Think of it this way: Employee ID is company-specific, UAN is for your entire career related to your Provident Fund. You can link all your previous and current EPF accounts to your single UAN for easy management. Plus, now many companies even ask for your PAN no. (like ABCDE1234F) during onboarding. These are separate from your employee ID & UAN.", "normalised": "Think of it this way: Employee I-D is company-specific, U-A-N is for your entire career related to your Provident Fund.
