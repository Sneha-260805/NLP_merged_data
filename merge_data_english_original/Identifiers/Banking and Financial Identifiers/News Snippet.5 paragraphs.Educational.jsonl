{"unnormalised": "A key component of the guidelines is the allocation of a 7-digit alphanumeric code to each DBU. The first 3 characters will represent the bank's existing IFSC code, followed by \"DBU\" and then a unique 3-digit numerical sequence. For example, a DBU of State Bank of India (SBI) could have an ID like SBINDBU001.
