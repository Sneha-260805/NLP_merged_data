{"unnormalised": "First up, we have the IFSC code. It's an 11-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each bank branch participating in the electronic funds transfer system. You'll need it for NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS transactions. It's typically printed on your cheque book and easily found online. For example, if you're sending money to Priya's SBI branch in Mumbai, you'll need their specific IFSC code, something like SBIN0000300. Make sure to double-check; incorrect code can cause delays or even failed transfers!", "normalised": "First up, we have the I-F-S-C code. It's an eleven character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each bank branch participating in the electronic funds transfer system. You'll need it for N-E-F-T, R-T-G-S, and I-M-P-S transactions. It's typically printed on your cheque book and easily found online. For example, if you're sending money to Priya's S-B-I branch in Mumbai, you'll need their specific I-F-S-C code, something like S-B-I-N zero zero zero zero three hundred. Make sure to double-check; incorrect code can cause delays or even failed transfers!"}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the MICR code. This is a 9-digit code printed on the bottom of your cheque, near the IFSC. It stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. This code helps identify the bank and branch, enabling automated cheque processing. It's crucial for banks to quickly sort and process the massive volume of cheques they handle daily. Think of it like the postal code for cheques!", "normalised": "Then there's the M-I-C-R code. This is a nine digit code printed on the bottom of your cheque, near the I-F-S-C.
