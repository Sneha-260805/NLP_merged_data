{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about the difference between IFSC, MICR, and other banking identifiers. It can be confusing, right? Basically, IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) is an 11-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies every bank branch in India. You need this for online transfers like NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS. Think of it like the address of a bank branch for online transactions. You can usually find it on your chequebook, passbook, or the bank's website. My SBI account IFSC is something like SBIN0012345.", "normalised": "Hey guys, someone asked me about the difference between I-F-S-C, M-I-C-R, and other banking identifiers.

{"unnormalised": "Now, MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) is a 9-digit code that you'll also find on your chequebook. It's printed using magnetic ink, which allows machines to read it easily. This code helps in processing cheques faster. The first 3 digits usually represent the city, the next 3 the bank, and the last 3 the branch. So basically, it ensures that your cheque doesn't get lost in the system. It's mostly used for cheque clearing, even though online transfers are more common now.", "normalised": "Now, M-I-C-R (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) is a nine digit code that you'll also find on your chequebook.

{"unnormalised": "Apart from these, there are other identifiers like the account number itself, which is obviously unique to your account, and sometimes banks use customer IDs. But for most practical purposes, IFSC and MICR are the key ones you'll encounter. Hope that clears things up! And remember to always double-check these details when making online transactions to avoid any problems. My ICICI Bank account number starts with something like 1234.
