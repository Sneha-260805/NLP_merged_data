{"unnormalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently issued updated guidelines regarding Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, particularly concerning the verification of banking and financial identifiers. These changes are aimed at streamlining the process and enhancing security for accountholders. One key update is the emphasis on verifying PAN numbers. Customers will now need to ensure their PAN (e.g., ABCDE1234F) is correctly linked and validated with their bank accounts. This is to prevent fraud and ensure accurate tax reporting.", "normalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (R-B-I) has recently issued updated guidelines regarding Know Your Customer (K-Y-C) procedures, particularly concerning the verification of banking and financial identifiers.

While linking Aadhaar is not compulsory for opening a bank account, providing your Aadhaar number (e.g., 1234-5678-9012) may be required for specific services such as high-value transactions or government subsidy schemes. Banks are also instructed to verify customer details against the Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR) using the customer's KYC identifier (e.g., CKYCR123456789).
