{"unnormalised": "First off, almost all online transactions in India are done using the Indian Rupee (₹ or Rs.). You'll see prices listed as ₹500 for a t-shirt or Rs. 2,500 for a pair of shoes. When you're paying through apps like PhonePe or Google Pay, or even using UPI, the amount is always deducted in INR. You might see some international websites showing prices in USD (e.g., $20), but when you pay, your bank will convert it to INR based on the current exchange rate (like ₹83 per $1, give or take). There could be a slight variation depending on your bank's conversion charges.", "normalised": "First off, almost all online transactions in India are done using the Indian Rupee (rupee or R-s).

{"unnormalised": "Now, about payment methods. UPI is HUGE. It's super convenient because you can directly link your bank account to these apps and pay with a single click. Then there are digital wallets like Paytm and Mobikwik, where you load money and then spend. Credit and debit cards are also widely accepted. Lots of e-commerce sites offer EMI options too, breaking down larger purchases (like a Rs. 50,000 TV) into smaller monthly payments. Keep an eye out for cashback offers, especially during festivals like Diwali! You might get ₹100 cashback on a ₹1000 purchase.", "normalised": "Now, about payment methods. U-P-I is HUGE.

Make sure the website or app you're using is legit (look for the padlock icon in the address bar) and never share your OTP with anyone. Happy shopping!
