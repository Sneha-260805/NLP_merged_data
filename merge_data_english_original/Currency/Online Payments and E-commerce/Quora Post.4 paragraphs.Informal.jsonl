You'll often see RuPay accepted too; it's the Indian card scheme, and good to support local! And don't forget about debit cards; pretty much every bank's card works nowadays.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about payment options on Indian e-commerce sites, right?

{"unnormalised": "UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is HUGE here. Bhim, Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm – they all use UPI. Super convenient; just scan a QR code or enter a UPI ID, and you're done. Works for small amounts like Rs. 10 for chai to big purchases like a new ₹50,000 fridge. Wallets are still around, but not as popular as UPI. You might find cashback offers if you use them, though!", "normalised": "U-P-I (Unified Payments Interface) is H-U-G-E here. Bhim, Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm – they all use U-P-I.
