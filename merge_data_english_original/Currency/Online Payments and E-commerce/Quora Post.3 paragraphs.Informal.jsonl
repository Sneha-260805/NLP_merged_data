{"unnormalised": "So, I was wondering about this the other day... What's the deal with all the different ways to pay online in India now? It's kinda crazy, right? Back in the day, it was just credit cards and maybe some net banking. But now, you've got everything from UPI apps like PhonePe and Google Pay to wallets like Paytm and Amazon Pay, plus all the old school options. And then you see all these deals... like \"10% cashback upto ₹200\" or \"Flat Rs. 50 off on your first transaction\". Gets a bit confusing, tbh!", "normalised": "So, I was wondering about this the other day... What is the deal with all the different ways to pay online in India now? It's kinda crazy, right?

{"unnormalised": "Seriously, it feels like every e-commerce site, like Flipkart or Amazon, and even local shops that are going digital are pushing a different payment method. Like, you'll see ads shouting \"Pay with Freecharge and get ₹75 cashback!\" or \"Use your HDFC card for an extra 5% discount\". And don't even get me started on the transaction fees! Sometimes you think you're getting a sweet deal, and then boom, \"convenience fee: Rs. 25\". Ugh. It's a jungle out there, trying to find the best way to pay without getting ripped off!", "normalised": "Seriously, it feels like every e-commerce site, like Flipkart or Amazon, and even local shops that are going digital are pushing a different payment method.
