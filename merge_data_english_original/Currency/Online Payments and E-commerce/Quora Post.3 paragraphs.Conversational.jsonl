{"unnormalised": "The biggest risk, I think, is just plain carelessness. People sharing their UPI PIN (which you should NEVER do!), or clicking on suspicious links they get in SMS.

Using strong passwords, keeping your UPI PIN secret, being wary of suspicious links, and sticking to reputable e-commerce sites (like Amazon or Flipkart) are musts. And always, ALWAYS double-check the payment details before you hit that \"Pay Now\" button, especially if you're transferring a large amount, like Rs. 25000 or more.
