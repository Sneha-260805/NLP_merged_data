I remember back in '08, trying to buy a book online. Had to use my dad's card, filled out a form longer than my arm, and prayed the ₹500 transaction would go through. Now, my grandma shops on Flipkart using UPI, it's insane.", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about how online payments are evolving in India, especially for e-commerce. My experience? It's a wild ride! I remember back in two thousand and eight, trying to buy a book online.

{"unnormalised": "The biggest change is definitely UPI. Seriously, everyone uses it. From buying chai at the roadside stall for ₹20 to paying for a new saree on Myntra for Rs. 2500, it's just so convenient. I even saw an auto-rickshaw accepting payments via PhonePe near Borivali station the other day. Credit cards are still around, of course, especially for bigger purchases and for folks who are into reward points. My Amex gives me amazing deals.", "normalised": "The biggest change is definitely U-P-I. Seriously, everyone uses it.

I used it once to get a new pair of headphones for Rs. 1500 from Amazon, split the payments over 3 months with no interest. A friend of mine got a fancy new OnePlus phone with a BNPL scheme; initial payment was ₹5000, and the rest in easy EMIs. It's making e-commerce accessible to so many more people, especially the younger crowd.", "normalised": "But what's really interesting is the rise of \"buy now, pay later\" (B-N-P-L) options.
