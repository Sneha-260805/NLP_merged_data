{"unnormalised": "One of the key changes is the mandatory implementation of tokenization for card-on-file (CoF) transactions. Previously, merchants could store customers' card details, making them vulnerable to data breaches. With tokenization, sensitive card information is replaced with a unique \"token,\" rendering it useless to fraudsters even if a merchant's database is compromised. For every Rs. 2000 spent the likelihood of fraud increases by 1.2% according to RBI.", "normalised": "One of the key changes is the mandatory implementation of tokenization for card-on-file (C-o-F) transactions.

These entities, which facilitate online transactions, will now be required to undergo regular security audits and adhere to stringent data localization requirements. The goal is to ensure that customer data is stored securely within India, minimizing the risk of cross-border data breaches.
