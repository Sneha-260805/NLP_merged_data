{"unnormalised": "One common area of unnormalized data revolves around currency representation. While the standard symbol for the Indian Rupee is ₹, it is frequently represented as Rs., INR, or even simply 'rupees'. Loan amounts are expressed in various formats, such as 'Rs. 5,00,000', '₹5L', or 'INR 500000.00'. The use of 'lakhs' and 'crores' is prevalent, leading to representations like 'Rs. 2.5 lakhs' or '₹1.2 crore', which requires conversion to a numerical format. Interest rates, often represented as percentages (e.g., '8.5% p.a.'), can appear with varying levels of precision (e.g., '8.50% per annum').", "normalised": "One common area of unnormalized data revolves around currency representation. While the standard symbol for the Indian Rupee is rupee, it is frequently represented as rupees, I-N-R, or even simply 'rupees'. Loan amounts are expressed in various formats, such as 'rupees five hundred thousand', 'rupee five lakh', or 'I-N-R five hundred thousand point zero zero'. The use of 'lakhs' and 'crores' is prevalent, leading to representations like 'rupees two point five lakhs' or 'rupee one point two crore', which requires conversion to a numerical format. Interest rates, often represented as percentages (e.g., 'eight point five percent p-a'), can appear with varying levels of precision (e.g., 'eight point five zero percent per annum')."}
{"unnormalised": "Date formats also exhibit significant variability. Loan agreements may specify repayment due dates as '15/08/2024', 'August 15th, 2024', '15th Aug, 2024', or even '15-08-24'. These dates need to be consistently normalized for accurate tracking of payment schedules and potential late payment penalties. Time periods related to loan tenures are often expressed in months or years (e.g., '60 months', '5 years'), requiring conversion to standardized time units.", "normalised": "Date formats also exhibit significant variability. Loan agreements may specify repayment due dates as 'fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four', 'August fifteenth, two thousand and twenty four', 'fifteenth Aug, two thousand and twenty four', or even 'fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four'.

Time periods related to loan tenures are often expressed in months or years (e.g., 'sixty months', 'five years'), requiring conversion to standardized time units."}
{"unnormalised": "Payment amounts, including installments (EMIs), are a frequent source of unnormalized data. An EMI of 'Rs. 10,500' might also appear as 'INR 10500.00', '₹10.5K', or 'Rupees ten thousand five hundred only'. Late payment charges are often expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount (e.g., '2% on overdue amount') or as a fixed fee (e.g., 'Rs. 500 late fee'). The application of these charges on specific dates (e.g., 'Late fee applicable after 30/09/2024') introduces further unnormalized date elements.", "normalised": "Payment amounts, including installments (E-M-I-s), are a frequent source of unnormalized data. An E-M-I of 'rupees ten thousand five hundred' might also appear as 'I-N-R ten thousand five hundred point zero zero', 'rupee ten point five thousand', or 'Rupees ten thousand five hundred only'. Late payment charges are often expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount (e.g., 'two percent on overdue amount') or as a fixed fee (e.g., 'rupees five hundred late fee'). The application of these charges on specific dates (e.g., 'Late fee applicable after thirtieth september two thousand and twenty four') introduces further unnormalized date elements."}
{"unnormalised": "Loan account numbers and transaction IDs are vital identifiers that often follow inconsistent formats. Account numbers might be represented with or without spaces and hyphens (e.g., '1234567890', '1234-5678-90'), and transaction IDs can vary significantly in length and composition (e.g., 'TXN12345', 'REF_67890'). The need to properly extract and validate these identifiers is crucial for reconciliation and audit purposes.", "normalised": "Loan account numbers and transaction I-D-s are vital identifiers that often follow inconsistent formats.

{"unnormalised": "Identifiers for financial institutions also contribute to unnormalized data. Banks are referred to using various abbreviations (e.g., 'SBI', 'ICICI', 'HDFC') or full names (e.g., 'State Bank of India', 'Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India'). Branch addresses, often included in loan documents, can contain inconsistent formatting and abbreviations (e.g., 'MG Rd', 'Connaught Place, ND 110001').", "normalised": "Identifiers for financial institutions also contribute to unnormalized data.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, loan-related abbreviations and acronyms can be challenging to interpret without proper context. Terms like 'KYC' (Know Your Customer), 'EMI' (Equated Monthly Installment), 'APR' (Annual Percentage Rate), and 'NPA' (Non-Performing Asset) require standardization and expansion for clear understanding and analysis. In summary, a comprehensive normalization strategy is essential to handle the diverse and often inconsistent data elements encountered in the Indian loan repayment ecosystem. This normalization ensures data accuracy, facilitates efficient processing, and supports effective financial decision-making.", "normalised": "Finally, loan-related abbreviations and acronyms can be challenging to interpret without proper context.
