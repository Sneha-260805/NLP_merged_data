{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you'll encounter is the concept of EMI, or Equated Monthly Installment. This is the fixed amount you pay each month to the lender until the loan is fully repaid. It comprises both the principal amount and the interest. For example, let's say Priya took out a home loan of Rs. 50,00,000 from HDFC Bank at an interest rate of 8.5% p.a. for 20 years. Her EMI would be calculated based on these factors.", "normalised": "One of the first things you will encounter is the concept of E-M-I, or Equated Monthly Installment. This is the fixed amount you pay each month to the lender until the loan is fully repaid. It comprises both the principal amount and the interest. For example, let us say Priya took out a home loan of rupee fifty lakh from H-D-F-C Bank at an interest rate of eight point five percent per annum for twenty years. Her E-M-I would be calculated based on these factors."}
{"unnormalised": "Understanding interest rates is paramount. They can be fixed or floating. Fixed interest rates remain constant throughout the loan tenure, providing predictability. Floating rates, on the other hand, fluctuate based on market conditions, potentially leading to higher or lower EMIs. Suppose the SBI offers a loan at a floating rate linked to the repo rate. If the RBI increases the repo rate by 0.25%, your EMI could increase.", "normalised": "Understanding interest rates is paramount. They can be fixed or floating.

{"unnormalised": "Loan tenure is another critical factor. A longer tenure means lower EMIs but higher total interest paid over the life of the loan. A shorter tenure means higher EMIs but lower total interest paid. Rakesh might opt for a 10-year loan instead of a 20-year loan to save on interest costs, even if his EMI is higher.", "normalised": "Loan tenure is another critical factor.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment is a great way to reduce your loan burden. Many lenders allow you to make partial prepayments without any penalty, especially on home loans. If Aisha receives a bonus of Rs. 1,00,000, she might choose to prepay a portion of her loan to reduce the principal amount and future interest payments. Some banks like ICICI Bank may have certain rules regarding pre-payment charges. Always check the T&Cs carefully.", "normalised": "Prepayment is a great way to reduce your loan burden.

Some banks like I-C-I-C-I Bank may have certain rules regarding pre-payment charges. Always check the T and C's carefully."}
{"unnormalised": "It's also crucial to understand the consequences of default. Missing EMI payments can negatively impact your credit score and lead to penalties. Continual default can result in the lender taking legal action, potentially leading to the seizure of your assets. Remember, maintaining a good CIBIL score is vital for future loan applications.", "normalised": "It is also crucial to understand the consequences of default.

Education loans may have a moratorium period, allowing you to defer repayments until after you graduate.
