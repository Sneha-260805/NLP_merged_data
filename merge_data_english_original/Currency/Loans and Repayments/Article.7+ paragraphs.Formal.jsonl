{"unnormalised": "One critical aspect often overlooked is the impact of inflation on loan repayments. While the nominal interest rate might seem attractive, the real interest rate – adjusted for inflation – provides a more accurate picture of the actual cost of borrowing. For instance, if the inflation rate is 6% and the loan interest rate is 9%, the real interest rate is only 3%. Borrowers should factor in the expected inflation rate over the loan tenure.", "normalised": "One critical aspect often overlooked is the impact of inflation on loan repayments.

Some lenders charge a penalty for early repayment of the loan, which can negate the benefits of reducing the loan tenure or lowering the overall interest paid. Borrowers should carefully review the loan agreement to determine whether pre-payment penalties apply and what the associated charges are. The prevailing penalty is often around 2% - 4% of the outstanding amount.", "normalised": "Pre-payment penalties are another important consideration.
