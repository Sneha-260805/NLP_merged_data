{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some advice on a loan situation. So basically, I took out a personal loan of Rs. 2,00,000 (2 lakh) from HDFC Bank a while back. The interest rate is like 12.5% p.a., which felt okay at the time, but now I'm kinda regretting it lol. My EMI is Rs. 5,000 per month, and honestly, it's a bit of a struggle with all the other expenses.", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some advice on a loan situation.

{"unnormalised": "I've been religiously paying on time for the last 12 months, but I'm thinking of prepaying a chunk of it to reduce the burden. I have around Rs. 50,000 saved up. Should I put that towards the loan? I'm worried about prepayment charges, though. I heard some banks charge like 2-3% on the prepaid amount. Does anyone know what HDFC's policy is?", "normalised": "I've been religiously paying on time for the last twelve months, but I'm thinking of prepaying a chunk of it to reduce the burden.

I saw ICICI Bank is offering personal loans at around 10.5% right now. But the whole process of transferring seems like a huge headache, plus there might be processing fees of Rs. 1000-2000.

{"unnormalised": "My friend suggested investing the 50k in mutual funds instead, aiming for a return higher than the loan interest rate. Sounds risky, though, especially with the market being so volatile these days. Plus, there's always the chance I might need the money for something else urgently.
