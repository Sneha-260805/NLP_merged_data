{"unnormalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently increased the repo rate by 0.25%, or 25 basis points (bps). This seemingly small change has significant implications for those with existing loans and those planning to take out new ones. In simple terms, the repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks. When this rate increases, banks, like SBI and HDFC, pass on the increased cost to their customers through higher interest rates on loans, including home loans, personal loans, and auto loans.", "normalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (R-B-I) recently increased the repo rate by zero point two five percent, or twenty five basis points (B-P-S).

{"unnormalised": "So, what does this mean for your EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments)? If you already have a loan, expect to see your EMI increase. For example, a home loan of Rs. 50,00,000 (50 lakh) with a remaining tenure of 15 years could see an EMI increase of approx. ₹1,000 per month. This is a rough estimate; the actual increase will vary depending on your loan agreement and the specific bank's policy. Banks typically offer two options: either increase the EMI amount while keeping the loan tenure the same or increase the loan tenure while keeping the EMI amount the same (at least in the short term). Many borrowers in India, perhaps ~65%, likely prefer keeping the EMI amount consistent.", "normalised": "So, what does this mean for your E-M-Is (Equated Monthly Installments)? If you already have a loan, expect to see your E-M-I increase. For example, a home loan of rupee five million (fifty lakh) with a remaining tenure of fifteen years could see an E-M-I increase of approximately rupee one thousand per month.

{"unnormalised": "For new loan applicants, the news is similar. Banks will likely offer loans at higher interest rates. Before applying for a loan, it's now more crucial than ever to compare rates from different banks like ICICI and Axis Bank. A difference of even 0.1% can translate to a substantial amount over the loan's life. Also, consider factors such as processing fees, pre-payment charges, and any other hidden costs. Remember to check the latest rates; as of 16/10/2024, the average home loan interest rate is around 8.75%.", "normalised": "For new loan applicants, the news is similar.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond EMIs, the repo rate hike impacts the overall cost of borrowing. This includes credit card interest rates, which are already quite high. It's wise to avoid relying heavily on credit cards and to pay your dues on time to avoid accumulating debt. The higher interest rates will likely moderate overall borrowing in the economy. This is part of the RBI's strategy to control inflation.", "normalised": "Beyond E-M-Is, the repo rate hike impacts the overall cost of borrowing.

{"unnormalised": "Think of it like this: if things become too expensive, people will be less likely to buy them, bringing costs down. If taking a loan, consider prepaying if you have extra funds available; even small amounts of ₹5,000 to Rs 10,000 annually can shorten your loan tenure.", "normalised": "Think of it like this: if things become too expensive, people will be less likely to buy them, bringing costs down.

{"unnormalised": "For savers, there's a silver lining. Banks may also increase interest rates on fixed deposits (FDs) and savings accounts. This provides an opportunity to earn a slightly better return on your savings. Always compare FD rates across different banks and choose the option that best suits your financial goals.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, the RBI's repo rate hike is a balancing act between controlling inflation and maintaining economic growth. As consumers, we need to be aware of these changes and adjust our financial strategies accordingly. Plan ahead, compare options, and make informed decisions to manage your finances effectively. Consider using a simple EMI calculator, there are several free ones online, to understand the potential impact of this change on your budget. As of October 2024, a rough estimate is that for every 100,000 Rs loan, expect about Rs 75-100 increase in monthly EMIs.", "normalised": "Ultimately, the R-B-I's repo rate hike is a balancing act between controlling inflation and maintaining economic growth.
