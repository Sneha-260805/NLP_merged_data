{"unnormalised": "One of the first things you’ll encounter is the **Principal Amount**. This refers to the original sum of money borrowed from the lender. For example, if you take out a home loan of Rs. 50,00,000 from HDFC Bank, the principal amount is ₹50,00,000. This is the base upon which interest is calculated. Understanding this fundamental amount is crucial as it directly impacts the total cost of your loan.", "normalised": "One of the first things you’ll encounter is the **Principal Amount**.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the **Interest Rate**, typically expressed as a percentage p.a. (per annum). It's the cost of borrowing money from the lender. Interest rates can be fixed, variable, or a hybrid of both. A fixed interest rate, like 8.5% p.a. from SBI, remains constant throughout the loan tenure, providing predictability in your repayments. A variable interest rate, however, fluctuates based on market conditions and benchmark rates, potentially leading to either higher or lower repayments over time.", "normalised": "Then there's the **Interest Rate**, typically expressed as a percentage p.a.

{"unnormalised": "Your **EMI** (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount you pay each month towards your loan. It comprises both the principal amount and the interest. Let's say your EMI is ₹25,000 for a personal loan. This amount is deducted automatically from your bank account on a specific date, usually around the 5th or 10th of each month. It's vital to ensure sufficient funds are available to avoid late payment charges.", "normalised": "Your **E-M-I** (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount you pay each month towards your loan. It comprises both the principal amount and the interest. Let's say your E-M-I is rupee twenty five thousand for a personal loan. This amount is deducted automatically from your bank account on a specific date, usually around the fifth or tenth of each month. It's vital to ensure sufficient funds are available to avoid late payment charges."}
{"unnormalised": "The **Loan Tenure** refers to the total duration over which you’ll be repaying the loan. It is typically expressed in months or years. A longer tenure, like 20 yrs for a housing loan, translates to lower EMIs but higher overall interest paid. Conversely, a shorter tenure results in higher EMIs but reduces the total interest burden. Finding the right balance is key to managing your finances effectively.", "normalised": "The **Loan Tenure** refers to the total duration over which you’ll be repaying the loan.

{"unnormalised": "**Prepayment Charges** are fees levied by the lender if you choose to repay a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount before the agreed-upon schedule. These charges can vary depending on the lender and the type of loan. Some banks, like ICICI Bank, may waive prepayment charges on certain loan products, while others might charge a percentage, say 2% of the prepaid amount.

{"unnormalised": "**Foreclosure** is the process of closing a loan account before the end of the agreed tenure by paying the remaining outstanding balance in a lump sum. This is often a desirable option if you have a sudden influx of funds. However, it is essential to factor in any foreclosure charges. For instance, some lenders might charge 3% of the outstanding principal for foreclosing a loan before the half way mark of the loan tenure.", "normalised": "**Foreclosure** is the process of closing a loan account before the end of the agreed tenure by paying the remaining outstanding balance in a lump sum.

{"unnormalised": "The **Amortization Schedule** is a table provided by the lender that shows the breakdown of each EMI payment into principal and interest components over the loan tenure.
