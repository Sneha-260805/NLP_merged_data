{"unnormalised": "The EMI amount depends on several factors: the principal loan amount (e.g., ₹50,00,000), the interest rate (let's say 8.5% p.a.), and the loan tenure (e.g., 20 years). A longer tenure generally means lower EMIs but higher total interest paid over the life of the loan. Conversely, a shorter tenure results in higher EMIs but less interest paid overall. Think of it as a trade-off between short-term affordability and long-term cost. For instance, a loan of Rs. 25 lakh at 9% interest for 15 years has a very different EMI compared to the same amount for 30 years.", "normalised": "The E-M-I amount depends on several factors: the principal loan amount (e.g., rupee fifty lakh), the interest rate (let's say eight point five percent per annum), and the loan tenure (e.g., twenty years).

For instance, a loan of rupees twenty five lakh at nine percent interest for fifteen years has a very different E-M-I compared to the same amount for thirty years."}
{"unnormalised": "Your EMI comprises two main components: principal repayment and interest payment. In the initial years of your loan, a larger portion of your EMI goes towards paying off the interest. As you progress through the loan tenure, the principal repayment portion gradually increases, while the interest payment decreases. This is because the interest is calculated on the outstanding principal amount. You can often find an EMI calculator online that shows you this breakdown, like the ones offered by ICICI Bank or HDFC Bank.", "normalised": "Your E-M-I comprises two main components: principal repayment and interest payment.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment is a fantastic option if you have surplus funds. Making even small prepayments regularly (e.g., Rs. 5000 extra per month) can significantly reduce your loan tenure and the total interest you pay. Many banks allow partial prepayments without any charges, but it’s essential to check the terms and conditions of your loan agreement. For example, prepaying just Rs. 1 lakh after 5 years on a Rs. 50 lakh loan can shave off months from your repayment schedule.", "normalised": "Prepayment is a fantastic option if you have surplus funds.

{"unnormalised": "Now, what happens if you miss an EMI payment? Missing an EMI can have negative consequences. Banks typically charge a penalty for late payments (e.g., 2% on the EMI amount), and repeated defaults can negatively impact your credit score (CIBIL score), making it difficult to obtain loans in the future. Contact your bank immediately if you anticipate difficulty in making an EMI payment; they may offer options such as restructuring your loan or granting a temporary payment holiday.", "normalised": "Now, what happens if you miss an E-M-I payment?

{"unnormalised": "Foreclosure, or completely paying off your loan before the end of the tenure, is another option. While some banks may charge a foreclosure fee (check your loan agreement for details), it can be beneficial if you have the funds available. However, weigh the foreclosure fee against the interest you would save by continuing with the regular EMI payments. Remember, even small decisions like choosing between a fixed rate at 8.75% vs a floating rate can impact your overall repayment significantly.", "normalised": "Foreclosure, or completely paying off your loan before the end of the tenure, is another option.
