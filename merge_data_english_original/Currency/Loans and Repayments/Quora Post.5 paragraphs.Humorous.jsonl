Let me tell you, it's a wild ride, almost as thrilling as watching a Bollywood action flick where the hero defies all logic and physics. Seriously, though, understanding your EMI is key, and not just nodding along when the bank manager tells you something that sounds suspiciously like Klingon.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about understanding loan repayments in India.

{"unnormalised": "First off, there's the whole interest rate circus. You see offers for 8.5% p.a. (per annum), but then the fine print hits you harder than a Rajinikanth punchline. Processing fees, foreclosure charges – it's a whole ecosystem designed to keep you on your toes. Don’t even get me started on the fluctuations! One minute, you’re thinking you’re saving money, the next the RBI does something and BAM! Suddenly you're paying more than your auto-rickshaw driver earns in a month.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the EMI itself. Everyone loves the word 'EMI' because it sounds easy, right? But the reality is you're basically paying for a percentage of the actual thing. Like that ₹50,000 loan turns into ₹65,000 with all that interest accumulating! Do the math. Use a calculator or, better yet, ask that mathematically inclined cousin who always brags about cracking IIT. They'll enjoy showing off, and you'll actually understand where your money's going.", "normalised": "Then comes the E-M-I itself. Everyone loves the word 'E-M-I' because it sounds easy, right?

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, dealing with loans in India can feel like navigating a crowded local train during rush hour. It is chaotic, exhausting, and you need to be ready to dodge a lot of unexpected elbows. But with a bit of knowledge, a healthy dose of humor, and maybe a prayer to Ganesha, you can make it through the other side in one piece. Just remember, read the fine print – it’s funnier than any stand-up comedy show.", "normalised": "Ultimately, dealing with loans in India can feel like navigating a crowded local train during rush hour.
