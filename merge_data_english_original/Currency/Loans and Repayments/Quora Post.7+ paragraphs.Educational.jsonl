{"unnormalised": "First, understand the basics. Let's say you take a personal loan of Rs. 5,00,000 from a bank at an interest rate of 12% per annum for a tenure of 5 years. The interest rate might be quoted as 12% p.a., meaning per annum. This basically determines how much extra you pay on top of the borrowed amount.", "normalised": "First, understand the basics.

{"unnormalised": "Now, the important part: EMI. EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It's the fixed amount you pay every month until your loan is completely paid off. Your EMI consists of two parts: principal repayment and interest payment. Initially, a larger portion of your EMI goes towards paying off the interest, and gradually, as time progresses, the principal repayment portion increases. There are online calculators that can show you a precise EMI amount, but, for our example, expect an EMI of approx. Rs. 11,122.", "normalised": "Now, the important part: E-M-I.

Initially, a larger portion of your E-M-I goes towards paying off the interest, and gradually, as time progresses, the principal repayment portion increases.

{"unnormalised": "Understanding loan amortization is also key. An amortization schedule is a table that shows how much of each EMI payment goes toward principal and how much goes toward interest, and how the principal amount decreases over time. You can usually request this from your bank. It's really important to check this before finalizing the loan.", "normalised": "Understanding loan amortization is also key.

{"unnormalised": "Next up is the concept of prepayment. Let's say after 2 years, you get a bonus and want to pay off a significant chunk of your loan. This is called prepayment. Many banks charge a prepayment penalty, usually a percentage of the amount you’re prepaying. For example, some banks may charge 2% on prepayment amounts exceeding Rs. 1 Lakh. But some banks, especially on floating rate home loans, might not charge anything. So, always check the fine print!", "normalised": "Next up is the concept of prepayment.

{"unnormalised": "Another important point is understanding the difference between fixed and floating interest rates. A fixed interest rate remains constant throughout the loan tenure. A floating interest rate, on the other hand, fluctuates based on market conditions. For example, your home loan at 8.5% might increase or decrease based on changes in the RBI's repo rate.", "normalised": "Another important point is understanding the difference between fixed and floating interest rates.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, be aware of potential fees and charges. There could be processing fees when you apply for the loan, late payment charges if you miss an EMI, or other hidden fees. Always read the loan agreement carefully and clarify any doubts with the bank before signing on the dotted line. This will save you from unpleasant surprises later on. For example, late payment fees could be something like Rs. 500 + 2% of the overdue EMI.", "normalised": "Finally, be aware of potential fees and charges.
