{"unnormalised": "First things first, understand the basics. A loan is essentially borrowing money from a bank (like SBI or HDFC), or some other financial institution, with the promise to pay it back with interest. That interest? It's the bank's way of making money off you, basically. So, shop around! Compare the interest rates offered by different banks, look for hidden fees, and don’t just jump at the first offer. They might lure you in with a low rate like, say 7.5%, but the processing fees can be crazy high!", "normalised": "First things first, understand the basics.

Personal loans, on the other hand, are usually smaller, maybe around Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5 lakh, and can be used for anything from a wedding to medical expenses.

{"unnormalised": "About repayment, this is where things get real. You’ll usually pay back the loan in monthly installments, known as EMIs. The EMI amount depends on the loan amount, the interest rate, and the loan tenure (how long you take to repay it).
