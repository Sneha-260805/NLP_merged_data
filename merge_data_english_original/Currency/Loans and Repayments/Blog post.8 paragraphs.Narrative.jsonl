I needed a loan, a big one. After weeks of research, I settled on the \"Startup Booster Loan\" from a private bank, offering what seemed like a sweet deal: Rs. 50 lakhs at 9.5% interest.

I used the loan to secure a prime location near Koramangala, hired a fantastic chef named Fatima (whose samosas are legendary), and invested in top-notch equipment – a fancy coffee machine, high-powered laptops, and even a small stage for weekend open mic nights.

{"unnormalised": "Reality, as it often does, delivered a sharp jolt. The first few months were slow. Really slow. Foot traffic was lower than expected, the online marketing campaign wasn't yielding results, and Fatima’s legendary samosas, while delicious, weren't enough to cover the rent.
