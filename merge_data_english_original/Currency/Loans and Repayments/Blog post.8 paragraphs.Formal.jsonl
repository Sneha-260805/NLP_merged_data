{"unnormalised": "One of the first steps in managing loan repayments is comprehending the different types of interest rates. Fixed interest rates, as the name suggests, remain constant throughout the loan tenure, offering predictability in monthly installments. Conversely, floating interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions, potentially leading to either lower or higher EMI amounts. For example, a home loan from HDFC Bank at 8.5% p.a. might seem appealing, but it's essential to factor in potential rate hikes that could increase your monthly outflow, potentially by Rs. 2000 or more.", "normalised": "One of the first steps in managing loan repayments is comprehending the different types of interest rates.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, understanding the concept of EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is paramount. EMI is the fixed amount you pay each month, comprising both the principal amount and the interest. Lenders typically offer various repayment tenures, ranging from a few years to several decades. Opting for a shorter tenure will result in higher EMIs but lower overall interest paid, whereas a longer tenure reduces the monthly burden but significantly increases the total interest outgo. Many borrowers take out 20 year loans for ₹50,00,000.", "normalised": "Furthermore, understanding the concept of E-M-I (Equated Monthly Installment) is paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment, also known as part payment, is another crucial aspect of loan management. Prepaying a portion of your loan principal can significantly reduce the outstanding amount and the overall interest burden. Most lenders in India allow prepayment without any charges, although some may impose penalties. Imagine prepaying Rs. 50000 on a car loan; it can save you several months' worth of interest. Be sure to check with the bank for specific guidelines and potential foreclosure charges; sometimes they can be 2% of the outstanding loan amount.", "normalised": "Prepayment, also known as part payment, is another crucial aspect of loan management.

{"unnormalised": "Refinancing your loan can also be a viable strategy, especially if interest rates have fallen since you initially took out the loan. Refinancing involves taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate to pay off the existing one. This can result in lower EMIs and substantial savings over the loan tenure. Banks like SBI often have promotional periods for refinancing at reduced interest rates for new customers.", "normalised": "Refinancing your loan can also be a viable strategy, especially if interest rates have fallen since you initially took out the loan.

{"unnormalised": "In India, loan repayment schedules often coincide with festivals and bonus payments. Many individuals utilize their Diwali bonus or tax refunds to make prepayments on their loans, accelerating their repayment process.
