{"unnormalised": "EMI, or Equated Monthly Installment, is a fixed payment you make to a lender each month to repay a loan over a set period. Understanding how it's calculated can help you make informed financial decisions. The formula looks complex: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N-1]. Let’s break it down. 'P' is the principal loan amount (e.g., a home loan of Rs. 50,00,000). 'R' is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12; so, if the annual rate is 8.5%, then R = 8.5/12/100). 'N' is the number of months for the loan tenure (e.g., 20 years = 240 months).", "normalised": "E-M-I, or Equated Monthly Installment, is a fixed payment you make to a lender each month to repay a loan over a set period.

The formula looks complex: E-M-I equals open bracket P multiplied by R multiplied by open bracket one plus R close bracket to the power of N close bracket divided by open bracket open bracket one plus R close bracket to the power of N minus one close bracket. Let us break it down. 'P' is the principal loan amount open bracket for example, a home loan of rupee fifty lakh close bracket. 'R' is the monthly interest rate open bracket annual interest rate divided by twelve; so, if the annual rate is eight point five percent, then R equals eight point five divided by twelve divided by one hundred close bracket. 'N' is the number of months for the loan tenure open bracket for example, twenty years equals two hundred and forty months close bracket."}

Just enter the principal amount, interest rate, and loan tenure, and it will calculate the EMI for you instantly. For example, if you take a personal loan of Rs. 1,00,000 at an interest rate of 12% for a period of 3 years (36 months), the EMI will be around Rs. 3321.", "normalised": "But don't worry about doing the math manually!

{"unnormalised": "It's crucial to understand that each EMI payment consists of two components: principal repayment and interest payment. In the initial months, a larger portion of the EMI goes towards paying off the interest, while a smaller portion goes towards the principal. As time progresses, this proportion gradually shifts, and a larger part of your EMI starts contributing towards the principal repayment. You can view this breakdown on your loan statement, often available online. Some banks like HDFC Bank and SBI offer detailed amortization schedules.", "normalised": "It is crucial to understand that each E-M-I payment consists of two components: principal repayment and interest payment.

{"unnormalised": "Pre-payment of your loan can significantly reduce the total interest paid over the loan tenure. Check if your lender levies any pre-payment charges; some banks allow pre-payment without penalty, especially on floating-rate home loans. Even small pre-payments, say Rs. 5000 or Rs. 10,000, can make a difference. It is also useful to note that the interest rate can be fixed or floating. A fixed rate remains constant throughout the loan tenure, while a floating rate is linked to a benchmark lending rate and can fluctuate. The EMI will fluctuate accordingly, so plan your finances accordingly.", "normalised": "Pre-payment of your loan can significantly reduce the total interest paid over the loan tenure.
