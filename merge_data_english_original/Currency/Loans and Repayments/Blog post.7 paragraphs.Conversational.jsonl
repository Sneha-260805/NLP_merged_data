{"unnormalised": "Let's start with the basics: EMI. It stands for Equated Monthly Installment. Basically, it's the fixed amount you pay every month to repay your loan. This includes both the principal amount and the interest. Many of us take personal loans, say for ₹500000, at an interest rate, maybe around 12% p.a. The EMI will depend on the loan tenure (how long you take to repay). Online EMI calculators are your best friend here! Plug in the numbers and see how your monthly payments will look.", "normalised": "Let us start with the basics: E-M-I. It stands for Equated Monthly Installment.

{"unnormalised": "Now, what about the interest rate? This is where things can get a little tricky. There are two main types: fixed and floating. A fixed interest rate means the rate stays the same throughout the loan tenure. Floating rates, on the other hand, can change based on market conditions. Imagine you took a home loan from HDFC at 8.5% interest. If it's fixed, great! But if it's floating, the rate could go up or down over time, affecting your EMI.", "normalised": "Now, what about the interest rate? This is where things can get a little tricky.

{"unnormalised": "Preponeing loan payments? Yes, you heard me right. If you suddenly get a bonus (maybe ₹25000 from your Diwali bonus at work!), you might consider making a pre-payment. This basically means paying off a chunk of the loan early. Doing this reduces the outstanding principal, which in turn reduces the total interest you pay over the loan tenure. However, banks often charge a \"foreclosure charge\" if you prepay before a specific period, so check the loan agreement before you prepay.", "normalised": "Preponing loan payments?

{"unnormalised": "Late payment fees! Oh, the dreaded late payment fees. These are charges you incur if you miss an EMI payment. Usually, the charges are a percentage of the outstanding amount, something like 2% or a fixed amount like Rs. 500. Always try to pay on time to avoid these unnecessary expenses! Set up reminders on your phone, or better yet, automate your EMI payments through your bank.", "normalised": "Late payment fees! Oh, the dreaded late payment fees.
