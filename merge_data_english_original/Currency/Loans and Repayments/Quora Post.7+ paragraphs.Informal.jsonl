{"unnormalised": "I also keep hearing about different types of charges. What's a processing fee, and how much is that usually? SBI was advertising something with no processing fee, but the interest rate seemed a bit higher...it was around 13%. Also, are there any other hidden charges I should be aware of?

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the whole CIBIL score thing. My score is currently at 750, I think. I checked it on Paisabazaar a few months back. Will that get me a better interest rate?
