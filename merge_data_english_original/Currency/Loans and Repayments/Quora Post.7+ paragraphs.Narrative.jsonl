Savings weren’t enough.", "normalised": "Like most middle-class Indians, I was initially hesitant. Loan E-M-I's always seemed daunting. But Priya's happiness was paramount. So, I started researching. I compared interest rates across different banks – S-B-I, H-D-F-C, I-C-I-C-I – reading through pages of fine print on their websites. The rates varied from nine point five percent to twelve point five percent per annum. It was confusing, to say the least."}
