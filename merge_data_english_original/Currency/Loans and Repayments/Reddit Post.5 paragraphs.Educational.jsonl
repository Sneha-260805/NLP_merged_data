{"unnormalised": "So, you’ve taken a loan, maybe a personal loan at 12% interest or a home loan from SBI. Now comes the time to pay it back! A common term you’ll hear is EMI – Equated Monthly Installment. This basically means you pay the same amount every month until the loan is cleared. The EMI usually includes both the principal amount (the original loan amount) and the interest. Often people think of their total monthly expenses and then just aim for the lowest EMI possible, but it's worth considering the impact on the long run.", "normalised": "So, you’ve taken a loan, maybe a personal loan at twelve percent interest or a home loan from S-B-I.

{"unnormalised": "A key factor to consider is the loan tenure. A longer tenure means a lower EMI, but you end up paying more interest overall. For example, if you take a loan of Rs. 5 lakhs for 5 years vs. 10 years, your monthly payment will be much lower with the 10-year tenure, but the total interest paid could be double! Banks like HDFC Bank usually have online calculators you can use to figure out these numbers. Don't just look at the EMI, look at the total repayment amount.", "normalised": "A key factor to consider is the loan tenure.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment is your friend! If you have some extra cash, like from a bonus (maybe Rs. 50,000), consider prepaying a portion of your loan. Most banks allow prepayment without any charges, though some may have restrictions. This can significantly reduce your outstanding principal and lower the overall interest you pay. Check with your bank on the specific terms; ICICI Bank, for instance, might have different prepayment rules than a smaller cooperative bank.", "normalised": "Prepayment is your friend!

If you see any discrepancies, like a missing payment or incorrect interest calculation, immediately contact your bank. It's better to catch small errors early than to deal with them later.
