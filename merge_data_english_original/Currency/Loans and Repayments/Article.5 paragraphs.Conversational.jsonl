{"unnormalised": "First up, EMIs. These are your Equated Monthly Installments – the fixed amount you pay every month till your loan is cleared. Your EMI covers both the principal amount (the actual loan) and the interest. Say you take a home loan of Rs. 25,00,000 from HDFC Bank. Your EMI will depend on the interest rate (let's say 8.5% p.a.) and the loan tenure (maybe 20 years). Banks often have EMI calculators on their websites, so you can easily see what your monthly outflow will be. Remember, a longer tenure means lower EMIs but you end up paying more interest overall.", "normalised": "First up, E-M-I-s.

Your E-M-I will depend on the interest rate (let us say eight point five percent per annum) and the loan tenure (maybe twenty years).

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the concept of prepayment. This is when you pay a lump sum towards your loan, over and above your regular EMI. Doing this can significantly reduce your outstanding principal and the total interest you pay. Many banks like SBI allow prepayment without any charges, but it's always wise to check. Let’s say after 5 years, you get a bonus of ₹1,00,000 and you decide to prepay your loan with that amount. This can shorten your loan tenure and save you a hefty sum in interest.", "normalised": "Then there is the concept of prepayment.

{"unnormalised": "Another important point to consider is processing fees. Banks usually charge a fee (often a percentage of the loan amount, like 1% or Rs. 5000, whichever is higher) to process your loan application. Shop around and compare processing fees from different banks. Also, be aware of other charges like late payment fees (if you miss an EMI), and foreclosure charges (if you want to close the loan before the agreed tenure).", "normalised": "Another important point to consider is processing fees.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, always remember to check the exchange rates if you are dealing with loans in foreign currencies. If you are planning to study abroad and take an education loan in USD, understanding the prevailing USD to INR exchange rate is crucial. A fluctuating exchange rate can impact the overall cost of your loan.", "normalised": "Finally, always remember to check the exchange rates if you are dealing with loans in foreign currencies.
