{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let's talk about interest rates. You'll often see terms like \"interest rate @ 8.5% p.a.\" That \"p.a.\" stands for \"per annum,\" meaning per year. So, if you borrow ₹1,00,000 at 8.5% p.a., you'll pay ₹8,500 in interest each year. Keep an eye out for the difference between fixed and floating rates. Fixed rates stay the same throughout your loan tenure, offering predictability. Floating rates, on the other hand, fluctuate with market conditions.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's talk about interest rates. You'll often see terms like \"interest rate at eight point five percent p.a.\" That \"p.a.\" stands for \"per annum,\" meaning per year. So, if you borrow rupee one lakh at eight point five percent p.a., you'll pay rupee eight thousand five hundred in interest each year.

Floating rates, on the other hand, fluctuate with market conditions."}
{"unnormalised": "Next up: EMI. This stands for \"Equated Monthly Installment.\" It's the amount you pay each month to repay your loan. Your EMI covers both the principal amount (the original loan amount) and the interest. Loan providers like HDFC and SBI can help you calculate this. The EMI you pay can be different on each website, so make sure to do a little bit of research before finalizing your loan.", "normalised": "Next up: E-M-I.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's tackle \"loan tenure.\" This simply refers to the length of time you have to repay your loan, often expressed in months or years. A longer tenure means lower EMIs, but you'll end up paying more interest overall. Shorter tenures mean higher EMIs but less total interest paid. Decide on what fits your financial planning best. For example, a loan for ₹5,00,000 over 5 yrs will have higher monthly payments than the same loan taken for 10 yrs.", "normalised": "Now, let's tackle \"loan tenure.\" This simply refers to the length of time you have to repay your loan, often expressed in months or years.

{"unnormalised": "Processing fees are another common term. These are charges levied by the lender for processing your loan application. They can range from 0.5% to 2% of the loan amount. Don’t forget to factor these fees into your overall loan cost! Sometimes, lenders will run promotions where they waive processing fees altogether, so it’s worth looking out for those deals.", "normalised": "Processing fees are another common term.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment penalties are charges you might incur if you decide to repay your loan before the end of the tenure. Some lenders don’t charge prepayment penalties, while others might charge 2% to 4% of the outstanding loan amount. Always check the fine print before you sign on the dotted line! If you think that you will have access to a large amount of money in the near future, it may be a better option to find a lender who does not charge any penalties.", "normalised": "Prepayment penalties are charges you might incur if you decide to repay your loan before the end of the tenure.

Maintaining a good credit score involves paying your bills on time and avoiding excessive debt.", "normalised": "Credit score is another crucial aspect.
