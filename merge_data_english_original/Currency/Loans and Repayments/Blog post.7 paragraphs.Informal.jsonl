{"unnormalised": "First things first, understand the EMI. Your EMI, or Equated Monthly Installment, is basically the fixed amount you pay every month till the loan is completely paid off. It consists of two parts: the principal amount (the actual loan amount) and the interest. Banks like HDFC or ICICI might advertise low interest rates (say, 7.5% p.a.), but make sure you understand how they calculate it - is it on a reducing balance or a fixed one? This can make a HUGE difference!", "normalised": "First things first, understand the E-M-I.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about prepaying. Let's say you unexpectedly got a bonus of ₹50,000. Should you splurge on that Goa trip, or prepay some of your loan? Honestly, prepaying even a small chunk can drastically reduce your overall interest burden. Some banks might charge a prepayment penalty (like 2% or 3% of the amount you're prepaying), so check the fine print before you jump in.

{"unnormalised": "And what if you're struggling to pay your EMIs? Don't panic! Talk to your bank. Many banks offer options like restructuring your loan or giving you a temporary moratorium (a break from payments). It's much better to be upfront than to default, which can seriously mess up your credit score (CIBIL score, if you're curious). A bad CIBIL score can make it really difficult to get loans in the future, even for something as simple as a credit card.", "normalised": "And what if you're struggling to pay your E-M-Is?
