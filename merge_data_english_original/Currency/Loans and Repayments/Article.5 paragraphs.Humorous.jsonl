{"unnormalised": "So, you’ve taken out a loan. Congratulations! You’re officially part of the “I owe someone money” club. Whether it's a personal loan for your cousin’s destination wedding in Udaipur (Rs. 5,00,000, anyone?), a home loan for that cozy 2BHK in Mumbai (EMI: ₹45,000 per month), or an education loan from SBI for that MBA you thought would guarantee a corner office (spoiler: it might not), you’re now playing the repayment game. And let’s be honest, it’s less a game of chess and more a chaotic game of Snakes and Ladders, but with extra interest rates and late payment fees.", "normalised": "So, you’ve taken out a loan.

{"unnormalised": "First, there’s the initial honeymoon phase. You diligently set reminders, autopay is your best friend, and you feel like you’re on top of the world. Your CIBIL score is smiling down upon you. The bank calls to congratulate you every month on paying back Rs 10,000 without fail for the last 3 months. Ah, the sweet smell of financial responsibility! But then, life happens. Diwali shopping splurges happen. Spontaneous Goa trips happen (Rs 25,000, thanks to that \"unavoidable\" friend's birthday). Suddenly, that pristine repayment record starts to look a little…smudged.", "normalised": "First, there’s the initial honeymoon phase.

{"unnormalised": "The real fun begins when you start contemplating “creative” solutions. Maybe you convince your uncle in Delhi to \"lend\" you some money (interest-free, of course).

Perhaps, just perhaps, you start believing those WhatsApp forwards promising instant loan forgiveness (spoiler alert: they’re scams).

{"unnormalised": "And then there are the joys of understanding loan jargon. Prepayment penalties? Fixed vs. floating interest rates? EMI vs. bullet repayments? It's like trying to decipher ancient Sanskrit while simultaneously juggling flaming torches. You spend hours on Google, only to emerge more confused than when you started.

{"unnormalised": "Ultimately, repaying a loan is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires patience, discipline, and a healthy dose of humor (because if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry). So, keep calm, keep paying those EMIs (even if they feel like a black hole swallowing your salary), and remember, one day, you’ll be free. And when that day comes, treat yourself to that vacation you’ve been dreaming of. Just maybe, skip the loan this time. A cup of chai in your own balcony might be a better celebration for a Rs 1,00,000 loan repayment.", "normalised": "Ultimately, repaying a loan is a marathon, not a sprint.
