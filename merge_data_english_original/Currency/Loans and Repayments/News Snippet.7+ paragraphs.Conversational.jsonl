{"unnormalised": "RBI’s recent announcement regarding repo rates has folks scratching their heads about home loan EMIs. Basically, it boils down to this: if the repo rate goes up, banks often increase their lending rates, meaning you pay more interest on your home loan. Conversely, if the repo rate dips, your EMI *could* come down. But it's not always a straightforward 'ghar se seedha' kinda thing, you know?", "normalised": "R-B-I's recent announcement regarding repo rates has folks scratching their heads about home loan E-M-I's.

ICICI Bank followed suit, bumping up their rates by a similar margin. This translates to an increase of approximately ₹1500 on a ₹50 lakh loan with a 20-year tenure – not a small chai-pani expense, right?", "normalised": "For example, H-D-F-C Bank recently revised its home loan rates by zero point two five percent, affecting folks with outstanding loans exceeding rupee twenty five lakhs.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about that \"could\" bit. Banks don’t *have* to pass on the full rate cut (or increase) to customers. They consider other factors, like their own cost of funds and the overall market scenario. So, your EMI might not change even if the RBI makes a move. It’s a bit of a 'wait and watch' game. Think of it like waiting for the monsoon – you know it's coming, but you don’t know exactly *when* and *how much* it'll rain.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about that \"could\" bit.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are different types of interest rates. A lot of loans are linked to MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) or external benchmarks like the repo rate itself. Loans linked directly to the repo rate tend to react faster to RBI policy changes. However, older loans might be tied to the base rate, which doesn’t fluctuate as frequently. Sorting that out feels like understanding which side of the railway station to wait on, doesn't it?", "normalised": "Then there are different types of interest rates.

{"unnormalised": "Here's a quick tip: Keep an eye on your bank statements and loan agreements. They'll usually notify you of any rate changes. Also, don't hesitate to negotiate with your bank if you feel you're paying too much interest. Sometimes, a little 'buttering up' can work wonders – especially if you’ve been a loyal customer for years.
