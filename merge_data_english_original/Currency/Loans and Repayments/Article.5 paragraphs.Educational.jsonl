{"unnormalised": "Taking a loan is a common financial strategy, whether it's for education, a new home, or business expansion. In India, understanding the nuances of loan repayments is crucial. Interest rates, loan tenure, and repayment options significantly impact the overall cost of borrowing. Different banks like SBI or HDFC offer varying terms. For instance, a home loan might have an interest rate of 8.5% p.a. while a personal loan could be much higher at 12% p.a. Always compare rates and terms before committing.", "normalised": "taking a loan is a common financial strategy, whether it is for education, a new home, or business expansion. in india, understanding the nuances of loan repayments is crucial. interest rates, loan tenure, and repayment options significantly impact the overall cost of borrowing. different banks like S-B-I or H-D-F-C offer varying terms. for instance, a home loan might have an interest rate of eight point five percent per annum while a personal loan could be much higher at twelve percent per annum. always compare rates and terms before committing."}
{"unnormalised": "The most common repayment method is through Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs). An EMI consists of both principal and interest components. Initially, a larger portion of the EMI goes towards interest, but as time progresses, the principal component increases. Lenders often provide an amortization schedule detailing this breakdown over the loan tenure. For a loan of ₹10 lakhs, repaid over 10 yrs, the EMI would differ significantly between different interest rates.", "normalised": "the most common repayment method is through Equated Monthly Installments (E-M-Is). an E-M-I consists of both principal and interest components. initially, a larger portion of the E-M-I goes towards interest, but as time progresses, the principal component increases. lenders often provide an amortization schedule detailing this breakdown over the loan tenure. for a loan of rupee ten lakhs, repaid over ten years, the E-M-I would differ significantly between different interest rates."}
{"unnormalised": "Prepayment, or making payments exceeding the scheduled EMI, is another important aspect. Many lenders in India allow borrowers to prepay their loans, either partially or fully. Prepayment reduces the outstanding principal and, consequently, the interest payable. Some banks may charge a prepayment penalty, usually around 2% to 4% of the prepaid amount, so check the terms carefully. Paying off a loan of Rs. 50,000 early can save a significant amount on interest.", "normalised": "prepayment, or making payments exceeding the scheduled E-M-I, is another important aspect. many lenders in india allow borrowers to prepay their loans, either partially or fully. prepayment reduces the outstanding principal and, consequently, the interest payable. some banks may charge a prepayment penalty, usually around two percent to four percent of the prepaid amount, so check the terms carefully. paying off a loan of rupees fifty thousand early can save a significant amount on interest."}
{"unnormalised": "Another factor to consider is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, especially for secured loans like home loans. A lower LTV ratio often results in a more favorable interest rate. For instance, if you're taking a loan for 80% of the property value, the interest rate may be slightly higher compared to a loan for 70% of the property value. This is because lenders perceive lower LTV loans as less risky.", "normalised": "another factor to consider is the Loan-to-Value (L-T-V) ratio, especially for secured loans like home loans. a lower L-T-V ratio often results in a more favorable interest rate. for instance, if you are taking a loan for eighty percent of the property value, the interest rate may be slightly higher compared to a loan for seventy percent of the property value. this is because lenders perceive lower L-T-V loans as less risky."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, maintaining a good credit score (CIBIL score) is essential. A higher credit score improves your chances of loan approval and can secure better interest rates. Regularly checking your credit report and promptly addressing any discrepancies is advisable. Defaulting on existing loans or credit card payments can negatively impact your score, making it harder to secure loans in the future. Someone with a CIBIL score below 700 may find it difficult to get a loan approved.", "normalised": "finally, maintaining a good credit score (C-I-B-I-L score) is essential. a higher credit score improves your chances of loan approval and can secure better interest rates. regularly checking your credit report and promptly addressing any discrepancies is advisable. defaulting on existing loans or credit card payments can negatively impact your score, making it harder to secure loans in the future. someone with a C-I-B-I-L score below seven hundred may find it difficult to get a loan approved."}
