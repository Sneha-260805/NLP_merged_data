{"unnormalised": "Okay, so you're thinking of taking a personal loan? That's a pretty common move, especially these days. Personal loans can be a real lifesaver for things like a wedding, unexpected medical bills, or even renovating your house. But bhai, before you jump in, you gotta be aware of the hidden charges. Banks and NBFCs don't always make these super clear upfront, and you don't want any nasty surprises later on, right?", "normalised": "Okay, so you're thinking of taking a personal loan?

{"unnormalised": "Next up, you've got the prepayment charges. Let's say you get a bonus from work or some extra cash and you want to prepay a part of your loan before the tenure ends. Great, right? Well, some banks will charge you for that privilege. It could be anywhere from 2% to 5% of the prepaid amount. For example, if you prepay Rs. 1 lakh and the charge is 3%, you'll pay Rs. 3000 extra. Make sure to check if your bank allows prepayment without any penalty after a certain time period, like 12 months.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the late payment fee. Life happens, right? Sometimes you might miss an EMI payment. Banks will definitely charge you for that. The penalty could be a fixed amount like Rs. 500, or a percentage of the EMI amount.
