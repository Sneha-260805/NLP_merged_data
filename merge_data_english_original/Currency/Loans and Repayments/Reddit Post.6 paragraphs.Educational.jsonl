It can be quite daunting, especially for first-timers!"}
{"unnormalised": "---", "normalised": "So, let's say you're looking at a personal loan from H-D-F-C Bank. They might advertise an interest rate of, say, ten point five percent p.a. (per annum). Seems straightforward, right? But that's just the starting point. Understanding the E-M-I, or equated monthly installment, is crucial. This is the fixed amount you'll pay every month, covering both the principal (the original loan amount) and the interest. Use an E-M-I calculator online – many bank websites like S-B-I's have them – to see how your E-M-I changes with different loan amounts and tenures. For example, a loan of rupee five lakh over five years (sixty months) at ten point five percent p.a. will have an E-M-I of around rupees ten thousand, seven hundred and fifty."}

However, many banks, including some private ones, charge a prepayment penalty. This could be something like two percent or three percent of the outstanding principal. Always check the fine print before you sign on the dotted line! Also, there's something called \"part-prepayment\" where you pay a lump sum but don't fully close the loan. This reduces your principal and therefore your future E-M-Is."}
{"unnormalised": "So, let's say you're looking at a personal loan from HDFC Bank. They might advertise an interest rate of, say, 10.5% p.a. (per annum). Seems straightforward, right? But that's just the starting point. Understanding the EMI, or equated monthly installment, is crucial. This is the fixed amount you'll pay every month, covering both the principal (the original loan amount) and the interest. Use an EMI calculator online – many bank websites like SBI's have them – to see how your EMI changes with different loan amounts and tenures. For example, a loan of ₹5 lakh over 5 years (60 months) at 10.5% p.a. will have an EMI of around Rs. 10,750/-.", "normalised": "Another important thing to consider is the difference between a fixed-rate and a floating-rate loan. With a fixed-rate loan, your interest rate remains the same throughout the loan tenure, regardless of market fluctuations. With a floating-rate loan, the interest rate is linked to a benchmark, such as the M-C-L-R (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) or repo rate. This means your E-M-I could increase or decrease depending on how the benchmark rate moves. Currently, a lot of folks are opting for fixed rates given the volatile market."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, prepaying your loan – paying it off earlier than the agreed tenure – can save you a significant amount of interest in the long run. However, many banks, including some private ones, charge a prepayment penalty. This could be something like 2% or 3% of the outstanding principal. Always check the fine print before you sign on the dotted line! Also, there's something called \"part-prepayment\" where you pay a lump sum but don't fully close the loan. This reduces your principal and therefore your future EMIs.", "normalised": "Then you have the processing fee, usually a percentage of the loan amount. This could be, for instance, one percent plus G-S-T. Don't forget to factor that into your overall cost.

A good score, generally above seven hundred and fifty, will not only increase your chances of loan approval but also help you get a better interest rate. Defaults on credit card payments or previous loans can severely impact your score. So, pay your bills on time and keep your credit utilization low. Hope this helps someone avoid common pitfalls!"}
