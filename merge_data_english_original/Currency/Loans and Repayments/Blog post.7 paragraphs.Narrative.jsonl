I definitely fall into the second category... well, *did*. I wanted to share my experience because navigating the world of loans, especially repayment, can be intimidating, even with all the information online. I needed ₹5,00,000 for my sister's wedding, and saving that up quickly just wasn't an option. So, a personal loan it was!", "normalised": "Getting a loan in India can feel like a rite of passage.

{"unnormalised": "The initial rush of having the money was amazing, but the reality of the EMI payments hit hard. I chose a 5-year tenure, and initially, the thought of paying ₹10,623 every month seemed manageable. But life, as it often does, had other plans. Unexpected expenses cropped up like weeds – a sudden repair to my auto-rickshaw (essential for my small business), medical bills for my mom (bless her heart), and even a small, impromptu trip to Goa with friends (regretted that one later!).", "normalised": "The initial rush of having the money was amazing, but the reality of the E-M-I payments hit hard.

{"unnormalised": "Around month 18, I started struggling. I missed an EMI payment. The bank, HDFC, was surprisingly understanding, but the late payment charges stung. That's when I realised I needed a proper strategy. I started tracking every rupee I spent. I cut down on unnecessary expenses (goodbye, weekend movie nights!). I even started selling some of my old books and clothes online. Every little bit helped. I was determined to get my finances back on track.", "normalised": "Around month eighteen, I started struggling. I missed an E-M-I payment.

{"unnormalised": "One thing that was super helpful was talking to a financial advisor. My friend, Rajat, works at ICICI Bank, and he gave me some amazing advice. He suggested prepaying small amounts whenever I had extra cash. Even ₹5,000 here and there would reduce the principal amount and shorten the loan tenure. I also learnt about refinancing, but decided against it since the interest rates were similar to what I was already paying.", "normalised": "One thing that was super helpful was talking to a financial advisor.

{"unnormalised": "I also discovered the magic of budgeting apps! Apps like Groww and ET Money can track your expenses, set financial goals, and even offer investment suggestions. It's like having a personal accountant in your pocket! They really helped me understand where my money was going and identify areas where I could cut back. For example, my monthly spend on Zomato/Swiggy was averaging ₹2,500. I've managed to cut it down to just ₹500.", "normalised": "I also discovered the magic of budgeting apps!
