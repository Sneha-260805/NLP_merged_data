{"unnormalised": "First things first, let's talk interest rates. You'll often see things like \"8.5% p.a.\" or \"10% ROI.\" That 'p.a.' stands for 'per annum,' meaning per year. So, if you borrow ₹1,00,000 at 10% p.a., you'll be paying ₹10,000 in interest each year, plus a portion of the principal amount. Banks like SBI or HDFC usually advertise these rates prominently, so keep an eye out for them. Remember, lower is generally better!", "normalised": "First things first, let's talk interest rates.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the question of tenure, or how long you have to pay back the loan. This can range from a few months to several years. Longer tenures mean lower monthly payments (EMIs, or Equated Monthly Installments), but you end up paying more interest overall. For example, a home loan of ₹50 lakhs over 20 years will have lower EMIs than the same loan over 10 years, but you'll shell out significantly more in interest charges over the long run.", "normalised": "Then there's the question of tenure, or how long you have to pay back the loan.

{"unnormalised": "Prepayment penalties are another thing to consider. Some banks might charge you a fee if you decide to pay off your loan early. This is usually expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount, say \"2% of the outstanding balance.\" However, RBI regulations have made it easier to prepay home loans without hefty penalties, so do check the fine print before signing on the dotted line.

{"unnormalised": "And what about the actual repayment process? Most banks offer easy online payment options through NEFT, RTGS, or UPI.

It's always good to know exactly how much you've paid, how much you still owe, and when your next payment is due.
