{"unnormalised": "Like, I know that withdrawing cash from ATMs beyond a certain limit incurs charges. Is it the same for all banks? I use ICICI Bank, and I think I read somewhere that after 5 free transactions (including both cash withdrawals and non-financial transactions) you get charged Rs. 20 + GST per transaction.
