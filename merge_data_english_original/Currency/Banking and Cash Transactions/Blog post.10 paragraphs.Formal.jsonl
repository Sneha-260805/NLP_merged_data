{"unnormalised": "Cash remains the lifeblood of many local economies. Small businesses, street vendors, and daily wage earners often conduct their financial activities primarily in cash. The reasons are multifaceted, ranging from limited access to formal banking services to a general preference for tangible money. A recent survey indicated that approximately 60% of transactions under ₹500 are still conducted in cash. This prevalence of cash transactions has implications for tax collection, financial transparency, and the overall formalization of the economy.", "normalised": "Cash remains the lifeblood of many local economies.

{"unnormalised": "The role of banks in this transition is paramount. Public sector banks like SBI and PNB have been instrumental in expanding financial inclusion through their extensive branch networks. However, they also need to modernize their infrastructure and embrace digital technologies to remain competitive and cater to the evolving needs of their customers. Private sector banks, on the other hand, often lead the way in innovation and customer experience, but need to ensure that their services are accessible and affordable to all segments of the population.", "normalised": "The role of banks in this transition is paramount.
