Usually, it's around ₹10,000 to ₹20,000 per transaction. So, if you're planning on withdrawing a larger sum, you might have to do a couple of transactions or head inside a bank. Also, keep an eye out for those sneaky ATM fees your bank back home might charge. Could be like $5 per withdrawal, so factor that in!", "normalised": "First off, let us talk A-T-M-s.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of banks, opening a local account might seem like a hassle, but if you're staying for a while, it's a lifesaver. Banks like SBI (State Bank of India) or HDFC are pretty common. You'll need your passport, visa, and maybe a local address proof. They usually require a min. balance, maybe around ₹2,000 to ₹5,000, depending on the bank and the type of account.
