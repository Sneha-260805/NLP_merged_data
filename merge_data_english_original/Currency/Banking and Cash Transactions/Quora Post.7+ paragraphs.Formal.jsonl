{"unnormalised": "Firstly, examine the bank's branch network. Is there a branch near your business location? Frequent cash deposits and withdrawals necessitate convenient access. Banks like SBI, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank have extensive branch networks across India. Look for branches with dedicated cash deposit machines (CDMs) to avoid long queues, especially during peak hours. Note that many CDMs have a deposit limit, often Rs. 49,999 per transaction to comply with PAN card regulations.", "normalised": "Firstly, examine the bank's branch network.

{"unnormalised": "Secondly, inquire about transaction limits and associated charges. Most banks offer a certain number of free cash deposits and withdrawals per month. Exceeding these limits often incurs charges, ranging from Rs. 2.50 to Rs. 5 per ₹1000. Negotiate these charges during account opening, especially if you anticipate high transaction volumes. Also, be mindful of the daily withdrawal limits. Many ATMs have a limit of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 per day. For larger withdrawals, you may need to visit a branch and provide advance notice.", "normalised": "Secondly, inquire about transaction limits and associated charges.

{"unnormalised": "Thirdly, consider the bank's technology infrastructure. Does the bank offer online banking and mobile banking facilities for tracking transactions and managing your account? Can you generate deposit slips online to save time at the branch? Look for features like real-time balance updates and transaction alerts via SMS or email. For instance, you might receive an alert when a deposit of Rs. 10,000 or more is made into your account.", "normalised": "Thirdly, consider the bank's technology infrastructure.

{"unnormalised": "Fourthly, assess the bank's security measures. What security protocols are in place to prevent fraud and unauthorized transactions? Does the bank offer insurance against cash theft or loss? Understand the bank's liability in case of fraudulent transactions involving your account.

{"unnormalised": "Fifth, compare interest rates on current accounts. While current accounts don't typically offer high interest rates, some banks may offer a small interest rate based on the average daily balance. Even a small percentage, say 0.5% per annum, can add up over time. Banks may also offer sweep-in facilities, where excess funds in your current account are automatically transferred to a fixed deposit account to earn higher interest.", "normalised": "Fifth, compare interest rates on current accounts.
