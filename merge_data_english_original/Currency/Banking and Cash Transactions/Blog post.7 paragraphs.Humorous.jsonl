{"unnormalised": "So, I needed to deposit ₹25000 cash into my account. Simple, right? Wrong! Entering an Indian bank branch is like stepping into a time warp, where technology took a vacation and customer service is a mythological creature. My first clue was the line. Oh, the line! It snaked through the hall like a particularly ambitious anaconda, filled with people clutching crumpled notes and forms filled in with the kind of optimism you only find in lottery ticket buyers.", "normalised": "So, I needed to deposit rupee twenty five thousand cash into my account.

{"unnormalised": "I braced myself. This wasn't going to be a quick in-and-out. I’ve had chai breaks shorter than this queue. After what felt like 3 business cycles, I finally reached the counter, where a man who looked like he’d aged a decade for every customer he’d served glared at me. I cheerfully (yes, cheerfully! I’m a masochist) presented my deposit slip and the aforementioned ₹25000.", "normalised": "I braced myself. This wasn't going to be a quick in-and-out. I’ve had chai breaks shorter than this queue.

{"unnormalised": "He squinted at the slip. “Aadhaar card?” he grunted. Now, I knew this was coming, but I like to pretend sometimes I don't need to prove my existence every time I breathe. I dug out my Aadhaar card (thankfully not laminated, or I’d be facing a whole other level of bureaucratic hell). He examined it with the intensity of an archaeologist unearthing a new civilization.", "normalised": "He squinted at the slip. “Aadhaar card?” he grunted.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, satisfied I wasn't trying to impersonate a deceased relative (a real concern, apparently), he started counting the cash. Now, this wasn’t a quick, efficient machine-count. No, this was hand-counted, bill by bill, with the solemnity of a religious ritual. He counted 5 notes of ₹2000, 10 notes of ₹500, and the rest in smaller denominations. It was a process that could rival the making of a Bollywood movie. After counting, he then rubber-banded it with a strength that would make a wrestler jealous.", "normalised": "Finally, satisfied I wasn't trying to impersonate a deceased relative (a real concern, apparently), he started counting the cash.

{"unnormalised": "Then, the ultimate test: the stamp. Bang! The deposit slip was officially baptized with a rubber stamp bearing the legend \"SBI BRANCH, XYZ\" and a date that may or may not have been correct (I swear it looked like 12/12/2023 but who am I to argue with destiny?). My receipt was handed over, and I was free to go. The whole ordeal took about 1 hour 15 minutes.

{"unnormalised": "The moral of the story? Banking in India is not for the faint of heart. Bring a book, a snack, and a healthy dose of patience. And for the love of all that is holy, make sure your Aadhaar card isn’t laminated. Oh, and maybe consider depositing ₹24999 next time. That way, maybe you can dodge some of the extra scrutiny!", "normalised": "The moral of the story? Banking in India is not for the faint of heart.
