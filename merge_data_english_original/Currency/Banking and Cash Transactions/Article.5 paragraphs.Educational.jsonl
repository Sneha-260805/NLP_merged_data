The bank teller verifies the details and deposits the cash. Similarly, Rakesh might need to withdraw Rs 5000. He presents his debit card, enters his PIN, and selects the withdrawal amount. The ATM dispenses the cash.", "normalised": "One of the most common transactions is depositing cash. Let's say Priya wants to deposit rupee ten thousand into her account at S-B-I.
