Once heavily reliant on cash transactions, the country is now experiencing a surge in the adoption of electronic platforms for various financial activities. This shift is fueled by government initiatives such as demonetization, increased internet penetration, and the convenience offered by mobile banking and UPI (Unified Payments Interface).

{"unnormalised": "One of the key drivers of this change is the increased accessibility of banking services to the masses. With the rise of fintech companies and the expansion of public sector banks like SBI and PNB, more people in rural and urban areas are gaining access to formal financial channels. The Jan Dhan Yojana, a national mission for financial inclusion, has played a crucial role in bringing a large segment of the unbanked population into the fold. This has resulted in a decrease in the reliance on informal lending sources and a corresponding increase in the use of debit cards, credit cards, and net banking for daily transactions. Average ATM withdrawals, however, still remain at about Rs. 4000 per transaction.", "normalised": "one of the key drivers of this change is the increased accessibility of banking services to the masses. with the rise of fintech companies and the expansion of public sector banks like S-B-I and P-N-B, more people in rural and urban areas are gaining access to formal financial channels. the jan dhan yojana, a national mission for financial inclusion, has played a crucial role in bringing a large segment of the unbanked population into the fold. this has resulted in a decrease in the reliance on informal lending sources and a corresponding increase in the use of debit cards, credit cards, and net banking for daily transactions. average A-T-M withdrawals, however, still remain at about rupees four thousand per transaction."}
