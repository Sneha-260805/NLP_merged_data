{"unnormalised": "First things first, remember the days when withdrawing ₹5000 from the ATM was a *major* errand? Now, you can just UPI your bhai for that much in seconds! Apps like PhonePe and Google Pay have made small transactions a breeze. Need to pay the chai wala ₹10? Bam! Auto-rickshaw driver wants ₹80? Done and dusted. It's super convenient, and honestly, I haven’t carried a wad of cash in ages.", "normalised": "First things first, remember the days when withdrawing rupee five thousand from the A-T-M was a major errand?

My grandmother, for example, still relies heavily on her savings account at SBI and prefers withdrawing a fixed amount (say, ₹2000) at the beginning of each month.

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the banks themselves. They're definitely getting in on the digital game. Most banks now offer user-friendly mobile banking apps where you can transfer funds, pay bills (everything from your electricity bill to your cable TV subscription), and even track your spending.

They even give you reward points – which you can sometimes redeem for, wait for it... cashback!", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the banks themselves.

While UPI itself is generally free for consumers, some banks charge transaction fees for exceeding a certain number of IMPS transfers per month. And then there's the whole data privacy thing.

{"unnormalised": "On the plus side, digital transactions are often more secure than carrying large amounts of cash. If you lose your wallet, you're out of luck.
