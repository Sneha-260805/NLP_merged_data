{"unnormalised": "First, let’s talk cash deposits. You can generally deposit cash at your bank branch, ATM (some allow it), or even through a banking correspondent. Remember to fill out the deposit slip accurately, especially the account number – a typo can mean your ₹5000 ends up in someone else’s account! And always keep the receipt as proof. Plus, some banks might charge a fee if you deposit over a certain amount in cash, like Rs. 20,000, so check with your bank's policies.", "normalised": "First, let's talk cash deposits. You can generally deposit cash at your bank branch, A-T-M (some allow it), or even through a banking correspondent. Remember to fill out the deposit slip accurately, especially the account number – a typo can mean your rupee five thousand ends up in someone else's account! And always keep the receipt as proof. Plus, some banks might charge a fee if you deposit over a certain amount in cash, like rupees twenty thousand, so check with your bank's policies."}
{"unnormalised": "Next, cash withdrawals. Obvious, right? But ATMs often have withdrawal limits, usually somewhere around Rs. 10,000 per transaction. If you need a larger amount, say ₹50,000 for an emergency, heading to the branch is usually the way to go. Remember your debit card PIN and don’t share it with anyone, bhai! If you suspect card fraud, contact your bank IMMEDIATELY.", "normalised": "Next, cash withdrawals. Obvious, right? But A-T-Ms often have withdrawal limits, usually somewhere around rupees ten thousand per transaction. If you need a larger amount, say rupee fifty thousand for an emergency, heading to the branch is usually the way to go. Remember your debit card P-I-N and don't share it with anyone, bhai!

{"unnormalised": "Then there are UPI transfers. It’s super convenient, but there are daily limits, generally capping out around Rs. 1 lakh per day. Also, remember that if you accidentally send Rs. 1000 to the wrong UPI ID, it can be tough to get it back. Double-check those digits! Using UPI is free, mostly, but some apps may have convenience charges.", "normalised": "Then there are U-P-I transfers. It's super convenient, but there are daily limits, generally capping out around rupees one lakh per day.

Using U-P-I is free, mostly, but some apps may have convenience charges."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, IMPS and NEFT for larger transfers. IMPS is generally faster, available 24/7, but has a higher transaction limit than UPI, often up to Rs. 5 lakh. NEFT is usually free, but it works in batches, so it might take a couple of hours for the money to show up. For amounts over say Rs. 2 lakh, NEFT or IMPS are generally preferred. Hope this clears up some basics! Stay financially safe, everyone.", "normalised": "Finally, I-M-P-S and N-E-F-T for larger transfers. I-M-P-S is generally faster, available twenty four seven, but has a higher transaction limit than U-P-I, often up to rupees five lakh. N-E-F-T is usually free, but it works in batches, so it might take a couple of hours for the money to show up. For amounts over say rupees two lakh, N-E-F-T or I-M-P-S are generally preferred.
