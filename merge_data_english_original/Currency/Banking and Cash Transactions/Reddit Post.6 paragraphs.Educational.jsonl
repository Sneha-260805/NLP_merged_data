{"unnormalised": "First off, UPI is generally for smaller, immediate transfers. Think buying chai for Rs. 20 at a local stall, or sending ₹500 to a friend. It uses the IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) infrastructure in the background, making it super quick. You're basically transferring money directly between bank accounts using virtual addresses (UPI IDs), like priya.sharma@oksbi. No IFSC code needed!", "normalised": "First off, U-P-I is generally for smaller, immediate transfers. Think buying chai for rupee twenty at a local stall, or sending rupee five hundred to a friend.

{"unnormalised": "NEFT, on the other hand, is better for larger sums. Imagine paying your rent of Rs. 15000 or sending Rs. 50000 to your family back home in Kerala. NEFT transfers are processed in batches, so they aren't instantaneous. Typically, the settlement happens in hourly batches, with the day’s last batch around 7:00 PM IST. It requires the recipient's bank account number, IFSC code (like SBIN0001234), and branch name. There's usually no upper limit, unlike UPI, though some banks might impose their own.", "normalised": "N-E-F-T, on the other hand, is better for larger sums.

{"unnormalised": "Now, regarding transaction fees. Generally, UPI transactions are free for users. However, the merchant might incur some charges. NEFT transactions are also usually free for online transfers initiated through net banking or mobile banking, especially post RBI's waivers. But, physically going to the bank branch to initiate an NEFT might incur a fee, something like Rs. 5 + GST for transactions up to Rs. 10,000.", "normalised": "Now, regarding transaction fees.

{"unnormalised": "One crucial thing to remember is the operational timings. UPI is available 24x7, 365 days a year. Need to pay at 2:00 AM? UPI is your friend.
