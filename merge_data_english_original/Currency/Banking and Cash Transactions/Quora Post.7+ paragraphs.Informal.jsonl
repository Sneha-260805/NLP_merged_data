{"unnormalised": "First off, the most obvious way is just going straight to your bank branch. Like, if you have an account with SBI, just walk into any SBI branch. Fill out that deposit slip – you know, the one with all the tiny boxes – and hand it over with your cash. Make sure you have your account number correct! That’s super important. No one wants their ₹5000 going to someone else, right? Usually, there’s a limit to how much you can deposit without needing to show ID. It's usually around Rs. 49,999, just under that 50k mark. Anything above that, and you'll need your PAN card.", "normalised": "First off, the most obvious way is just going straight to your bank branch.

{"unnormalised": "Another option is using a third-party service like a business correspondent (BC). These are basically mini-banks in smaller towns and villages, often operated by local shops. They work with banks to provide basic banking services, including cash deposits.
