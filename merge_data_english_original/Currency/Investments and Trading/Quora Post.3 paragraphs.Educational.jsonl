{"unnormalised": "Well, investing can seem daunting at first, but it's definitely doable even with limited knowledge. A good starting point is understanding the basics. Consider options like mutual funds (MFs), particularly index funds, as they offer diversification. You can start with a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) of even Rs. 500 per month. Look at funds that track the NIFTY 50 or Sensex; these are generally considered less risky. Research different fund houses like HDFC, ICICI, or SBI, but remember past performance isn't always indicative of future returns.", "normalised": "Well, investing can seem daunting at first, but it is definitely doable even with limited knowledge.

Plus, the capital gains on redemption are tax-free! Also, explore Fixed Deposits (FDs) in reputed banks like PNB or Axis Bank.
