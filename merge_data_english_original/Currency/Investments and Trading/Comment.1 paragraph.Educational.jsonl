{"unnormalised": "Hey folks, newbie here looking for some guidance. I've got ₹50,000 to invest, and I'm thinking of putting it into either mutual funds or the stock market. I've heard good things about both, but I'm not sure which one is right for me. Mutual funds seem safer, but the returns might be lower, maybe around 12% p.a.? Stocks are riskier but could potentially give me returns of 20%+? I’m looking at maybe holding for 5 yrs. Any advice from experienced investors? Should I diversify or put all my eggs in one basket, considering it's not a huge amount? Thanks in advance!", "normalised": "Hey folks, newbie here looking for some guidance.
