{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me if investing in penny stocks is like betting on the IPL. Well, kinda, but with slightly better odds... maybe. Look, both involve risk, excitement, and the potential to lose your chai-paani money. Seriously though, I wouldn't recommend putting your life savings into either. Think of it this way: a good stock, like a well-made dosa, takes time and the right ingredients. A penny stock is more like that vada you bought from the roadside stall - cheap, potentially delicious, but also could give you a stomach ache.", "normalised": "Someone asked me if investing in penny stocks is like betting on the I-P-L.
