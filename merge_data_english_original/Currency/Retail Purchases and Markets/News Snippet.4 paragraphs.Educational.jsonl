{"unnormalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently released data indicating a significant uptick in digital payment adoption across the country. UPI transactions, for instance, saw a jump of approx. 35% in volume compared to the previous fiscal year. While this signals a positive shift towards a cashless economy, a closer look reveals that cash remains the dominant mode of transaction for smaller retail purchases. According to the report, over 60% of transactions below Rs. 500 are still conducted using physical currency, particularly in local markets and smaller towns.", "normalised": "The Reserve Bank of India (R-B-I) recently released data indicating a significant uptick in digital payment adoption across the country.

{"unnormalised": "Several factors contribute to this persistence. Many small vendors, especially in rural areas, lack the necessary infrastructure for digital payments, such as PoS machines or reliable internet connectivity. For example, the local vegetable vendor in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, or the chaiwala near CST station in Mumbai, often prefer cash due to the convenience and immediate settlement it offers.", "normalised": "Several factors contribute to this persistence.

While UPI transactions are generally free, other digital payment methods may incur charges, especially for merchants. Furthermore, incidents of online fraud, though relatively low, can deter individuals from switching to digital alternatives, particularly for small, everyday expenses like buying groceries for ₹200 from the nearby kirana store or purchasing paani puri for just Rs 30.", "normalised": "Moreover, concerns regarding transaction fees and cybersecurity persist among both vendors and consumers.

However, bridging the digital divide and addressing concerns about security and costs are crucial to fully realize the potential of a cashless economy, particularly for retail transactions in the Indian context.
