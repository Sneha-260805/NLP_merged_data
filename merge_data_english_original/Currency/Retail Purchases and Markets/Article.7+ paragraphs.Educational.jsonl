{"unnormalised": "One of the first things to note is the prevalence of cash transactions, especially in smaller markets and roadside stalls. While digital payment methods are increasingly popular, many vendors still prefer cash. Be prepared to haggle, especially in traditional markets. You might find a vendor initially quoting Rs. 500 for a saree, but with some bargaining, you could bring it down to Rs. 400 or even Rs. 350. Always carry smaller denominations like ₹10, ₹20, and ₹50 notes for easier transactions, particularly when buying items that cost ₹5 or ₹15.", "normalised": "One of the first things to note is the prevalence of cash transactions, especially in smaller markets and roadside stalls.
