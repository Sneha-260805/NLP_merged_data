{"unnormalised": "One thing I've learned is that every little bit helps. You don't need to donate lakhs of rupees to make a difference. Even a small, consistent contribution can have a real impact. Think about it - if 100 people donate ₹100 each, that's ₹10,000! That could feed a family for a month, or provide essential medical supplies. Plus, many charities offer various payment methods these days, making it easier than ever to donate. You can use UPI, credit card, net banking, all super convenient.", "normalised": "One thing I've learned is that every little bit helps. You don't need to donate lakhs of rupees to make a difference.

There are so many worthy causes out there, from supporting children's education to providing healthcare to underserved communities. Check out Charity Navigator India or GuideStar India. They rate charities based on their transparency and financial accountability.
