{"unnormalised": "I was reading the other day about how even a small donation can make a huge difference. Like, seriously, just Rs. 500 can provide meals for a family in need for a week. Think about that! That's less than the cost of a fancy pizza! I mean, you can skip the Domino's for a week and make a real impact. It’s about prioritizing, right?", "normalised": "I was reading the other day about how even a small donation can make a huge difference.

{"unnormalised": "There are so many amazing charities out there doing incredible work. You've got ones focused on education, providing schoolbooks and uniforms for kids who can’t afford them.

{"unnormalised": "Plus, let's be honest, donating just *feels* good. You get that warm, fuzzy feeling inside knowing you’ve helped someone out. Maybe it’s the “karma” thing we Indians are all about, or maybe it’s just basic human decency. Whatever it is, it's a win-win. Like, I remember last Diwali, I donated ₹1000 to a local orphanage instead of buying myself that new saree I was eyeing.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I know what you’re thinking: “I’m just a student/struggling professional/auto-rickshaw driver! I don’t have much to give.” But that’s the beauty of it! Every little bit counts.
