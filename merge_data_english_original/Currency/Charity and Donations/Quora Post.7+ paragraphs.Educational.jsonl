{"unnormalised": "First, always verify the NGO's registration and certifications. Look for organizations registered under Section 12A and 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This allows you to claim tax deductions on your donations. You can usually find this information on their website or by asking them directly. Transparency is key. For example, an NGO might state: \"Donations above Rs. 500 are eligible for tax deduction under Section 80G.\" Confirm this independently. Also be aware that some charities only accept Rupees.", "normalised": "First, always verify the N-G-O's registration and certifications.

{"unnormalised": "Next, consider the area of impact you want to support. Do you want to help with education, healthcare, environmental conservation, or disaster relief? Many NGOs focus on specific causes. Some examples include providing meals to underprivileged children (often needing about Rs. 1500/month per child), supporting education for girls (maybe needing Rs. 10,000/year for school fees), or contributing to disaster relief efforts (requirements vary greatly depending on the emergency).", "normalised": "Next, consider the area of impact you want to support.

{"unnormalised": "Another crucial aspect is understanding the organization's overhead costs. A good charity will allocate a high percentage of donations directly to its programs rather than administrative expenses. Look for organizations that allocate at least 75% of their funds to their core mission. This information is usually available in their annual reports or on their website. Some sites even rate charities based on their efficiency.", "normalised": "Another crucial aspect is understanding the organization's overhead costs.

{"unnormalised": "When making donations, explore different payment methods. Many NGOs accept online transfers, credit cards, and UPI payments. For larger donations, bank transfers are often preferred. Be cautious about donating in foreign currencies, as some organizations may not have the necessary FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) registration to receive such funds. For instance, an NGO might only accept donations in INR. For international transfers, always check the prevailing exchange rate. Keep records of your transactions for tax purposes. A donation of $50 converted to INR will depend on the current rate.", "normalised": "When making donations, explore different payment methods.
