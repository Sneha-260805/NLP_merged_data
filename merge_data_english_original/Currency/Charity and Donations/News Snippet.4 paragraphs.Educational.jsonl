For instance, 'Give India' reported a 20% drop in donations compared to last year. Previously, contributions from overseas donors were a major source of funding for initiatives like providing clean water in villages and supporting education in underprivileged communities.

{"unnormalised": "Donations within India are also being affected by economic factors. While individual contributions are vital, they haven't been sufficient to compensate for the decline in foreign funding. Online platforms such as Milaap and Ketto continue to facilitate local fundraising, but the average donation amount has remained stagnant at around ₹500 per contributor. This makes it difficult for NGOs to launch large-scale projects, particularly those requiring significant capital outlay.", "normalised": "Donations within India are also being affected by economic factors.

{"unnormalised": "Many NGOs are now focusing on corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives by Indian companies. Under the Companies Act, a certain percentage of profits (2% usually) must be allocated to social causes. However, competition for these funds is fierce, and organizations need to demonstrate a clear impact to secure CSR partnerships. Securing even ₹10,00,000 through CSR can be a lengthy process, involving detailed proposals and rigorous audits.", "normalised": "Many N-G-Os are now focusing on corporate social responsibility (C-S-R) initiatives by Indian companies. Under the Companies Act, a certain percentage of profits (two percent usually) must be allocated to social causes.

Campaigns highlighting the tax benefits of charitable giving (under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act) may also incentivize more individuals to contribute. It's crucial to remember that even small amounts, such as ₹100, can collectively make a significant difference in supporting vulnerable communities across India.", "normalised": "Experts suggest that promoting financial literacy and awareness among the Indian population could lead to a rise in domestic donations.
