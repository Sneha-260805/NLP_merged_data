This post aims to clarify some key aspects.", "normalised": "Firstly, consider the currency of donation. Most Indian charities operate primarily in I-N-R (rupee). If you are donating from abroad, be mindful of the exchange rates. You can typically donate in foreign currencies like U-S-D (dollar) or E-U-R (euro) through international payment gateways, but the charity will receive the equivalent amount in I-N-R after conversion, subject to applicable bank charges. It's always a good idea to check the current U-S-D to I-N-R or E-U-R to I-N-R exchange rate to know how much your donation will be worth in Indian rupees. For instance, if you donate dollar one hundred and the exchange rate is rupee eighty three per dollar, the charity will receive approximately rupee eight thousand three hundred, minus any fees."}

Donations to registered charities under Section eighty G of the Income Tax Act can be claimed as deductions from your taxable income. This can significantly reduce your tax burden. Ensure that the charity you're donating to is registered under Section eighty G. They should provide you with a receipt stating their registration number and the amount of your donation. For example, if you donate rupee five thousand to a recognized charity, you can deduct this amount when filing your income tax return. It's beneficial for both the charitable organization and the donor."}

For example, a transaction reference number like \"U-T-R two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two three\" can serve as proof of your donation."}
