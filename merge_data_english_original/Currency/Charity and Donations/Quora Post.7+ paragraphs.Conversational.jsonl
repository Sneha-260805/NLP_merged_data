Think of it this way: Rs. 100 might not seem like a lot to you, but it could buy a meal for someone in need. Remember that.", "normalised": "Firstly, let's talk about the mindset.

{"unnormalised": "Now, practically speaking, consider your monthly budget. After covering all the essentials (rent, groceries, bills, that all-important chai!), see what's left over. Maybe you can spare 5% of your income? Or 10%? Some people even aim for a tithing model, giving away 10% of their earnings. It's really up to you.

{"unnormalised": "Look for reputable charities. Do your research! There are tons of organizations out there, some legit, some… not so much. Check if they're registered under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. That way, you can claim tax deductions on your donations. Sites like GiveIndia and Charities Aid Foundation are good places to start. They usually have verified listings and details on how the money is used. I personally prefer donating directly to smaller, local NGOs sometimes. They often have a more direct impact, and you can see the results firsthand. For example, there's this organization in my building that feeds stray dogs and their UPI ID is registered as something with dogfood.org. They accept even Rs. 20.", "normalised": "Look for reputable charities. Do your research! There are tons of organizations out there, some legit, some… not so much.
