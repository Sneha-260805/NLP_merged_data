My grandma always said \"give back what you can,\" and honestly, after getting my bonus at work, I feel like I can finally afford to. But there are SO many options!

I've heard some horror stories about charities with huge admin costs, so I'm trying to avoid those. Has anyone had experience with CRY (Child Rights and You)? I saw an ad for them, and they seem pretty good. What about Akshaya Patra?
