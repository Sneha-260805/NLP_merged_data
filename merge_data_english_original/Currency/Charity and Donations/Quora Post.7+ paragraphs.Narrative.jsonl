Sometimes, it's just about that rupee five hundred that you might have otherwise spent on a coffee at C-C-D, and that can make all the difference in somebody's life. That's why I donate. It is my way of honoring my dad's values and making the world slightly better, one small contribution at a time. And hopefully, inspiring others to do the same."}
