{"unnormalised": "First off, consider the amount. Even a small donation can make a big difference. You might see NGOs asking for as little as ₹500 per month to sponsor a child's education. That's less than what you might spend on a weekend chai and samosa treat! Of course, larger contributions are always welcome. Many organizations offer different tiers of giving, from ₹5,000 to ₹50,000 or more, with each tier offering different levels of impact or benefits.", "normalised": "First off, consider the amount.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the currency itself. While most donations within India are in INR (Indian Rupees), some international charities may accept donations in USD or EUR. The exchange rate can fluctuate, so keep an eye on that when deciding how much to give. For example, $100 might be roughly equivalent to ₹8,300 one day, but the next day it could be ₹8,350. It’s always a good idea to check the current conversion rate before making your donation.", "normalised": "Then there's the currency itself.

{"unnormalised": "Many charities, especially those working with vulnerable populations, rely on regular, smaller donations rather than one-time large gifts. A recurring donation of, say, Rs 1000/month can provide a consistent source of funding for their programs. This helps them plan better and ensure that their work continues uninterrupted. Think of it as contributing a small \"EMI\" towards a good cause.", "normalised": "Many charities, especially those working with vulnerable populations, rely on regular, smaller donations rather than one-time large gifts.

This means that if you donate, say, Rs. 10,000, you can deduct a portion of that amount from your taxable income, reducing your overall tax burden. Make sure the charity you're donating to has a valid 80G certificate. You'll need this to claim the deduction.", "normalised": "Tax benefits are another thing to consider.
