Recent studies indicate that approx. 65% of donations to registered NGOs in India now originate from online sources. This shift presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations operating in the not-for-profit sector. While convenience and accessibility are enhanced, the management of diverse donation amounts, often in varying currencies and denominations, requires robust financial infrastructure.", "normalised": "The Indian charitable landscape is increasingly reliant on digital platforms for fundraising, which necessitates a closer examination of currency handling and transparency in online donations.

{"unnormalised": "A critical aspect is the adherence to regulatory norms regarding foreign currency donations. The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) mandates that all organizations receiving funds from overseas must maintain strict compliance, including detailed reporting of each transaction. E.g., a donation of USD 100 from a donor in the USA needs to be converted to INR at the prevailing exchange rate, as recorded by authorized dealers, and subsequently documented for FCRA compliance. Failure to meticulously track these transactions can lead to penalties and even revocation of the organization's FCRA registration.", "normalised": "A critical aspect is the adherence to regulatory norms regarding foreign currency donations.

While individually these amounts may seem insignificant, their cumulative impact can be substantial. For instance, a campaign to support underprivileged children might receive ₹250 from 1000 donors, totaling Rs. 250,000. Accurate accounting and reporting of these aggregated small donations are crucial for maintaining donor trust and ensuring financial integrity.", "normalised": "Moreover, the prevalence of small value donations, frequently below rupee five hundred, through U-P-I and other digital wallets requires efficient processing and reconciliation systems.
