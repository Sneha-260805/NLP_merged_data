Resist the urge to donate rupee one hundred every time someone with a slightly sad face accosts you at a traffic signal.

Probably buy more signals."}

Leverage the power of matching grants. Many companies offer to match employee donations, meaning your rupee five thousand could magically become rupee ten thousand! It's like finding a rupee two thousand note in your old jeans – pure, unadulterated joy!
