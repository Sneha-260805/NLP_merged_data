I try to earmark around 2% of my annual income but sometimes life happens. Last year, I ended up donating approx. Rs. 25,000 to various causes. That included Rs. 5000 to a local NGO that helps underprivileged children with their education, and another Rs. 10000 to a disaster relief fund after the Kerala floods.", "normalised": "Someone asked me how much I typically donate to charity in a year.

It's not a huge amount, but it’s something we've been doing for generations.
