{"unnormalised": "The transparency and traceability afforded by digital transactions are also compelling factors driving this trend. Donors can easily track their contributions and receive receipts for tax deduction purposes, fostering greater trust and accountability. Many platforms provide detailed breakdowns of how donations are allocated, ensuring that funds are utilized effectively and in accordance with the organization's stated mission. For instance, a donation of Rs. 500 might cover the cost of providing meals for 10 underprivileged children.", "normalised": "The transparency and traceability afforded by digital transactions are also compelling factors driving this trend.

It is crucial for charitable organizations to implement robust security measures to protect donors' financial information and maintain their trust. Verified payment gateways and encryption protocols are essential to mitigate the risk of cybercrime and ensure the integrity of donation transactions. A user might be apprehensive to donate ₹5000 if the website doesn't have the \"https\" security protocol in place.", "normalised": "However, the digital realm is not without its challenges.

A donation of $20 might translate to ₹1660 on one day and ₹1670 on another.", "normalised": "The currency conversion aspect also comes into play when international donors contribute to Indian charities.
