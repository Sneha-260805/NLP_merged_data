A strategically timed coughing fit. Classy, I know. But hey, Rs. 10 here, Rs. 20 there... it adds up! That's like, two cups of chai at my regular *chaiwala*! And let’s be honest, chai is basically charity, keeping me functioning and vaguely resembling a productive member of society.", "normalised": "The first hurdle, of course, is the relentless bombardment of donation requests.

One time, after buying a single packet of Maggi (for the record, it was Rs. 14, thank you very much!), I got bombarded with requests to \"Sponsor a Child for Just Rs. 500/Month!\".

That it’s a complicated, often overwhelming, and occasionally hilarious journey. And that maybe, just maybe, I can balance my love for cheap chai with my desire to do a little good in the world. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go find Rs. 7.50. My *chaiwala* raised his prices.
