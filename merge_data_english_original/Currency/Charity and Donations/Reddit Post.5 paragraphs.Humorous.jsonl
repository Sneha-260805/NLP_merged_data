Like, should I give Rs. 500 to that orphanage near my house? Seems legit, they always need stuff.

{"unnormalised": "But then the real questions hit me. What's the rupee exchange rate for good karma? Is there a premium if I donate via Paytm instead of cash? Asking for a friend... who's also me. I started wondering if donating ₹2000 would qualify me for some kind of tax break. I mean, I’d totally donate more if it meant I could brag about it on LinkedIn while simultaneously dodging the income tax guy. Efficient altruism, am I right? It's all a balancing act between feeling good and not feeling too much of a pinch in my wallet.

{"unnormalised": "And let's be honest, the biggest challenge is resisting the urge to calculate the \"true\" cost of that donation.

Simple, effective, and way less mentally taxing. Plus, immediate gratification for both of us! Maybe I'll round it up to Rs. 150 if he's got a particularly good joke. Happy Diwali, everyone! May your donations be tax deductible and your mithai be plentiful.", "normalised": "So yeah, donating to charity is noble and all, but it's also surprisingly complex.
