{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit India, quick question about donations! I'm planning to donate to a few charities this Diwali, but I'm a bit confused about the best way to do it and how much I should be aiming for. Like, is it better to give a big chunk sum of ₹5000 to one NGO, or spread it out, giving, say, Rs. 500 to ten different ones?", "normalised": "Hey Reddit India, quick question about donations!

{"unnormalised": "I understand that every little bit counts, but I'm also wondering if there's a certain threshold where the donation makes a *real* difference to the organization. Also, does anyone know if there's a minimum amount for tax deductions? I heard somewhere that you need to donate at least ₹2000 to claim it under section 80G. Is this true? I am also exploring options to donate in USD. The conversion rate today is ₹83/$. So, if I donate 100 USD, will it be considered as ₹8300 for tax purposes?", "normalised": "I understand that every little bit counts, but I am also wondering if there is a certain threshold where the donation makes a real difference to the organization.

I am also exploring options to donate in U-S-D. The conversion rate today is rupee eighty three per dollar.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, I'm seeing different organizations asking for donations through various platforms. Some prefer direct bank transfers, others use payment gateways like Razorpay, and some are even accepting crypto (although I'm not touching that, lol!). Are there any platforms that are generally considered more trustworthy or transparent when it comes to ensuring the money reaches the intended beneficiaries? I saw one called \"GiveIndia\" - anyone has experience with them? Are there any hidden charges?", "normalised": "Furthermore, I am seeing different organizations asking for donations through various platforms.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, are there any specific causes or organizations you guys would recommend? I'm particularly interested in supporting education for underprivileged children, maybe something in the range of Rs. 250/month to sponsor a child's education. Also considering animal welfare, as I've been seeing so many stray dogs suffering in my locality, especially during the monsoon season, which costs around Rs. 3000 per dog for treatment. Any suggestions for reputable NGOs in Mumbai or across India that focus on these areas would be greatly appreciated.", "normalised": "Finally, are there any specific causes or organizations you guys would recommend?
