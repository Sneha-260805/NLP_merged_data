Even beggars have gone digital, lol. But seriously, the ease of donating online has made a real difference, especially with everything going on. You can send ₹500 to a disaster relief fund in Kerala with just a tap on your phone. Imagine that.", "normalised": "Donating to charity in India, yaar, it's become so digital these days.

Check their registration, see their financials. Look for the ones that actually show impact. My friend Priya, she only donates to NGOs that have a valid 80G certificate 'cause that gives you tax benefits, double whammy!

Buying him chai for a week, that's a donation in its own way, isn't it? Or the lady who sells flowers near the temple, maybe she needs help with her kid's school fees. Every little bit helps. Even donating old clothes or books to the local orphanage is a form of charity.
