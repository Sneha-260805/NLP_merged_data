{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk about reading your electricity bill. You’ll see something like \"Units Consumed: 250 kWh\". Now, that means you used 250 kilowatt-hours. The cost per unit might be, say, Rs. 6.50. So, 250 units * Rs. 6.50/unit gives you Rs. 1625. That's your basic electricity charge.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk about reading your electricity bill. You’ll see something like \"Units Consumed: two hundred and fifty k-W-h\". Now, that means you used two hundred and fifty kilowatt-hours. The cost per unit might be, say, rupees six point five zero. So, two hundred and fifty units multiplied by rupees six point five zero per unit gives you rupees one thousand six hundred and twenty five. That's your basic electricity charge."}
{"unnormalised": "But hold on, there's more! You’ll also see things like \"Fixed Charges: ₹100\" – this is a flat fee regardless of how much electricity you use. Then there's often a \"Fuel Adjustment Charge (FAC)\" – this fluctuates based on the cost of fuel used to generate electricity. This could be something like Rs. 0.50/unit, adding another Rs. 125 (250 * 0.50).", "normalised": "But hold on, there's more! You’ll also see things like \"Fixed Charges: rupee one hundred\" – this is a flat fee regardless of how much electricity you use. Then there's often a \"Fuel Adjustment Charge (F-A-C)\" – this fluctuates based on the cost of fuel used to generate electricity. This could be something like rupees zero point five zero per unit, adding another rupees one hundred and twenty five (two hundred and fifty multiplied by zero point five zero)."}
{"unnormalised": "Water bills are similar. They're usually based on volume consumed, measured in liters or kiloliters (1 kL = 1000 liters). You might see \"Water Consumed: 15 kL\" and a rate of Rs. 15 per kL. So, that's Rs. 225 for the water itself. There's often a separate charge for sewage, maybe 60% of the water charge, so another Rs. 135 (approx).", "normalised": "Water bills are similar. They're usually based on volume consumed, measured in liters or kiloliters (one k-L equals one thousand liters). You might see \"Water Consumed: fifteen k-L\" and a rate of rupees fifteen per k-L.

There's often a separate charge for sewage, maybe sixty percent of the water charge, so another rupees one hundred and thirty five (approximately)."}
{"unnormalised": "And then, of course, there's the dreaded GST. Goods and Services Tax. This is a percentage added to the total bill amount. Let’s say the GST rate is 18%. You add up all the charges (electricity, fixed charges, FAC, water, sewage) to get the subtotal. Then you multiply that subtotal by 0.18 to get the GST amount. It could easily add another Rs. 300-400 depending on the base amount.", "normalised": "And then, of course, there's the dreaded G-S-T. Goods and Services Tax. This is a percentage added to the total bill amount. Let’s say the G-S-T rate is eighteen percent. You add up all the charges (electricity, fixed charges, F-A-C, water, sewage) to get the subtotal. Then you multiply that subtotal by zero point one eight to get the G-S-T amount. It could easily add another rupees three hundred to four hundred depending on the base amount."}
{"unnormalised": "Now, about the \"security deposit\". This is usually a one-time thing when you get a new connection. Think of it as insurance for the utility company. It's typically a few thousand rupees (₹2000-₹5000, sometimes more), and you're supposed to get it back when you close the connection. *Supposed* to. Keep your receipts!", "normalised": "Now, about the \"security deposit\". This is usually a one-time thing when you get a new connection. Think of it as insurance for the utility company.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, pay attention to due dates! Late payment fees can be killer. They might be a percentage of the outstanding amount (e.g., 2% per month) or a flat fee (e.g., ₹50). Paying on time saves you money. Consider setting up auto-pay through your bank to avoid the hassle. Many apps like Paytm or Google Pay can automatically pay these bills too, sometimes even offering cashback deals like \"₹10-₹20 cashback on electricity bill payment\".", "normalised": "Lastly, pay attention to due dates!
