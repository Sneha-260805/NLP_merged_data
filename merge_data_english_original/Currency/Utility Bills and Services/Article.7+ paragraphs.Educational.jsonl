{"unnormalised": "The primary currency you’ll encounter is, of course, the Indian Rupee (₹ or Rs.). Utility bills are invariably denominated in INR. However, it’s important to note that different prefixes and formats might be used. For instance, you might see \"Rs. 500\", \"₹500\", or simply \"500 INR\". All refer to the same amount. Pay close attention to the decimal places as well, as small errors can lead to discrepancies. A bill for \"₹1234.56\" is different from \"₹1234.50\", even though the difference is seemingly minor.", "normalised": "The primary currency you’ll encounter is, of course, the Indian Rupee (rupee or R-s dot).

{"unnormalised": "Many utility providers now offer online payment options, which often involve transaction fees. These fees, typically a small percentage of the total bill amount (e.g., 1.5% for credit card payments), are also expressed in INR. Be aware of these charges, as they can add up over time. Also, look for options like UPI, which might have lower or no transaction fees. You might see terms like \"Convenience Fee: Rs. 10\" on your payment gateway.", "normalised": "Many utility providers now offer online payment options, which often involve transaction fees.

{"unnormalised": "Discounts and subsidies, often provided by the government or utility companies, are also reflected in your bills in INR. These could be fixed amounts (e.g., \"Subsidy: Rs. 200\") or percentage-based reductions (e.g., \"Early Payment Discount: 2%\"). Always verify that these discounts have been applied correctly to your bill to avoid overpayment. Sometimes promotional offers are provided such as \"Flat 100 off on bill payment above Rs 1000 via Paytm\".", "normalised": "Discounts and subsidies, often provided by the government or utility companies, are also reflected in your bills in I-N-R.

{"unnormalised": "Late payment charges are another essential currency-related aspect. Utility companies typically levy penalties for bills not paid by the due date. These charges can be a fixed amount (e.g., \"Late Fee: Rs. 50\") or a percentage of the outstanding balance (e.g., \"Late Payment Penalty: 1% per month\"). Paying your bills on time is crucial to avoid these unnecessary expenses. For example, delaying a bill of ₹2500 by a month could incur a late fee of, say, ₹25.", "normalised": "Late payment charges are another essential currency-related aspect.

When establishing a new utility connection, you're usually required to pay a security deposit, which is refundable upon termination of the service. This amount, expressed in INR (e.g., \"Security Deposit: ₹1000\"), serves as a guarantee for the utility provider. Similarly, if you overpay your bill, you might be entitled to a refund, which will be credited back to your account in INR.", "normalised": "Furthermore, keep an eye out for security deposits and refunds.

While the bill itself is in INR, the equivalent amount in foreign currency will vary depending on the prevailing exchange rate. For instance, a bill of Rs. 7500 might cost you $90 one day and $92 the next, due to exchange rate variations.
