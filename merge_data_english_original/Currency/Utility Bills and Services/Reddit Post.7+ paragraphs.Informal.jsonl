{"unnormalised": "Like, seriously, I’m no expert but what is FAC charges (Rs. 250) and what is it supposed to mean. Plus there’s a fixed charge that's always around ₹300, which I guess is fine, but then there's the energy charge itself, which seems to fluctuate wildly. I’m starting to think it's all just some random number generator. Maybe I should just get solar panels or something.", "normalised": "Like, seriously, I’m no expert but what is F-A-C charges (rupees two hundred and fifty) and what is it supposed to mean.

I've tried calling their customer care (dial 1912), but it's always a massive wait, and they never really explain anything clearly.

It's frustrating, man.", "normalised": "Anyone else facing similar issues with Adani Electricity?

{"unnormalised": "I’m living in a 2 BHK apartment with just my wife, and we're pretty conscious about saving electricity. We mostly use LED bulbs, switch off appliances when not in use, and try to avoid using the AC too much. I mean, its not like we are running a factory here. Even with the saving, I’m paying like 2x of my friend who is living in Gurgaon.

{"unnormalised": "On a side note, is there any way to track my electricity consumption more accurately? I’ve been thinking about getting one of those smart plugs that measure energy usage, but I'm not sure if they're reliable. Any recommendations? It would be nice to see exactly how much electricity each appliance is using so I can figure out where to cut back. Or maybe I should just move back to my parents' house in Delhi. At least the electricity bills there are cheaper (though the rent is a killer!). What do you guys think? Should I go ahead with registering a complaint?", "normalised": "On a side note, is there any way to track my electricity consumption more accurately?
