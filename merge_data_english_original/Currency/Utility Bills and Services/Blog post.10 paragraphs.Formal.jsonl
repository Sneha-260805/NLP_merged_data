{"unnormalised": "First and foremost, let's consider electricity bills. In most Indian cities, like Mumbai or Delhi, electricity providers follow a tiered pricing system. This means that the rate per unit (kWh) increases as your consumption rises. For example, the first 100 units might cost Rs. 3/unit, the next 200 units at Rs. 5/unit, and so on. Therefore, keeping your consumption within the lower tiers is key to reducing your overall bill. Check your bill for detailed tariff slabs; discoms like BSES or Tata Power provide comprehensive breakdowns.", "normalised": "First and foremost, let's consider electricity bills.

{"unnormalised": "Water bills in India generally consist of two components: a fixed charge and a variable charge based on consumption (in kiloliters). Metered water supply is becoming increasingly common, especially in metropolitan areas. Understanding your consumption patterns is vital. A leaky tap or a running toilet can significantly increase your water bill. Always be mindful of water usage, especially during the dry season. Check your bill for your meter reading, previous readings, and the number of kiloliters consumed in the billing cycle. For instance, a bill might show a consumption of 15 KL and a total charge of Rs. 500.", "normalised": "Water bills in India generally consist of two components: a fixed charge and a variable charge based on consumption (in kiloliters).

{"unnormalised": "Gas bills, primarily for piped natural gas (PNG), follow a similar structure to water bills. They comprise a fixed charge and a variable charge based on consumption in standard cubic meters (SCM). PNG is increasingly popular for cooking and heating in many urban Indian households. Monitor your gas meter regularly and compare it with the readings on your bill. Gas companies like Mahanagar Gas or Indraprastha Gas Limited provide online portals where you can track your consumption and view past bills. A typical gas bill could show a consumption of 20 SCM and a total amount due of Rs. 800.", "normalised": "Gas bills, primarily for piped natural gas (P-N-G), follow a similar structure to water bills.

{"unnormalised": "Apart from the usage charges, utility bills often include other components such as meter rent, service charges, and taxes. Understanding these charges is essential for a complete picture of your bill. Meter rent is the fee for maintaining the meter installed at your property. Service charges cover the cost of delivering the utility to your home. Taxes levied by the government, such as electricity duty or water tax, are also included in the bill. A quick glance at your bill might reveal a service charge of Rs. 50 and a meter rent of Rs. 25.", "normalised": "Apart from the usage charges, utility bills often include other components such as meter rent, service charges, and taxes.
