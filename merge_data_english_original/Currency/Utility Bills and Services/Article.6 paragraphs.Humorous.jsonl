{"unnormalised": "Ah, the utility bill. That monthly reminder that adulthood isn't all Bollywood dance numbers and unlimited chai. It’s a comedy of errors, a tragedy in triplicate, and a suspense thriller wondering just *how* high that number will be. This month, my electricity bill read ₹5,789.50. I swear, my appliances are powered by hope and the occasional prayer to Ganesha, not a nuclear reactor.", "normalised": "ah, the utility bill. that monthly reminder that adulthood isn't all bollywood dance numbers and unlimited chai. it's a comedy of errors, a tragedy in triplicate, and a suspense thriller wondering just how high that number will be. this month, my electricity bill read rupee five thousand seven hundred and eighty nine point five zero. i swear, my appliances are powered by hope and the occasional prayer to ganesha, not a nuclear reactor."}
