{"unnormalised": "Ah, the utility bill. That monthly reminder that adulthood isn't all Bollywood dance numbers and endless plates of biryani. It's a serious business, folks, a rollercoaster of numbers and abbreviations that could make even the most seasoned accountant weep.

{"unnormalised": "First, there’s the electricity bill. It arrives with a flourish, declaring your consumption in kWh, or \"kilo-watt hours.\" I've always wondered, are those the same hours that disappear mysteriously when I'm binge-watching my favourite shows? And the charges! Fixed charges, variable charges, meter rent – it’s like they're inventing new ways to extract Rs. 500 from your unsuspecting wallet. Last month, my bill was Rs 2345.67 – I’m pretty sure my neighbour is siphoning off my power to fuel his illegal disco. Next month I'm reducing my power consumption to 0.00001 kWh out of spite.", "normalised": "First, there’s the electricity bill.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the water bill. This is where things get murky (pun intended). How can a family of four possibly consume 10,000 liters of water in a month? Are we secretly watering an entire jungle in our backyard? Or is there a hidden portal to the Yamuna River beneath our bathroom tiles? The bill always states it to be about Rs. 876.45, but I swear, my shower only lasts 5 minutes. It also shows a cryptic 'Volumetric Charge' - does that mean I'm paying extra for the sheer volume of my complaints to the municipality?", "normalised": "Then comes the water bill.

{"unnormalised": "Don't even get me started on the internet bill. I pay for \"unlimited data\" but somehow, I'm always receiving ominous messages warning me that I've reached 90% of my data limit. Is it unlimited, or is it a cleverly disguised mirage designed to torment me? And the speeds! We're promised 100 Mbps, but the reality is more like 10 Mbps, which is just enough to load a blurry image of a cat meme every five minutes. But hey, at least it only costs me ₹999 per month, plus GST, plus a \"convenience fee,\" plus the emotional cost of constant frustration.", "normalised": "Don't even get me started on the internet bill.

{"unnormalised": "And let's not forget the mobile bill. It's a labyrinth of talk time, data packages, and value-added services that I never signed up for. I swear, somewhere in the fine print, it says that I've agreed to receive daily horoscopes and ringtones featuring Bollywood songs from the 90s. And why does a 1-minute phone call to my sister cost Rs 5.37? Is she secretly talking to me from the moon? I might switch to telegram - it's cheaper!", "normalised": "And let's not forget the mobile bill. It's a labyrinth of talk time, data packages, and value-added services that I never signed up for.

{"unnormalised": "These utility bills, they are a testament to the resilience of the Indian spirit. We navigate the cryptic jargon, the fluctuating rates, and the occasional billing errors with a blend of bewilderment and acceptance. We grumble, we sigh, and then we pay, because what choice do we have? Unless we want to live in the dark, unwashed, and cut off from the world, we're stuck in this monthly cycle of comedic torture.", "normalised": "These utility bills, they are a testament to the resilience of the Indian spirit.

{"unnormalised": "So, the next time you receive your utility bill, don't despair. Instead, embrace the absurdity. Read it aloud in a dramatic voice. Imagine the meter readers as characters in a Bollywood film. And remember, you're not alone. We're all in this together, paying for the privilege of modern life, one hilarious bill at a time. Think of it as a donation to the never-ending sitcom that is life in India. After all, laughter is the best medicine... and it's probably cheaper than paying for a therapy session to deal with the stress of reading your bills. Remember to pay by 5 PM on 27/03/2024 or else.", "normalised": "So, the next time you receive your utility bill, don't despair. Instead, embrace the absurdity. Read it aloud in a dramatic voice.

May we all find the humour in it, before it drives us completely insane.
