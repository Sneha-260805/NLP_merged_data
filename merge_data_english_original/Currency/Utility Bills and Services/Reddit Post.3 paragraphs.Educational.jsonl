{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to understand something about utility bills in India and I’m hoping someone can shed some light. I keep seeing different ways amounts are expressed and I'm a bit confused. For example, my electricity bill this month shows a total of Rs. 2,350.75. My friend's water bill shows ₹1,800, no decimals. Is there a \"correct\" way, or is it just vendor preference? Also, why do some bills just say ₹2K?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to understand something about utility bills in India and I'm hoping someone can shed some light.

I've never seen it, but I'm trying to get a grasp on when these larger units are used in billing contexts. Any advice or resources would be super helpful.
