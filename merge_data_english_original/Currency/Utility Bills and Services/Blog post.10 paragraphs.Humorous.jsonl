Followed by the creeping suspicion that I accidentally left the AC running in the metaverse. I mean, seriously? Last month, it was only ₹4500, and I'm pretty sure I haven't adopted a secret life as a crypto miner.", "normalised": "Act one: The Arrival. It all starts innocently enough.

{"unnormalised": "Act II: The Investigation. This is where things get serious. I whip out the bill like a detective on a stakeout. Let’s see, reading from meter no. 1234567890 on 15/07/2024, that seems legit. But then I see it: “Units Consumed: 987 kWh.” Nine hundred and eighty-seven?!

{"unnormalised": "The blame game commences. Was it my fault? Possibly. Did I leave the geyser on overnight? Maybe.

{"unnormalised": "Act III: The Resolution (or Lack Thereof). Armed with my bill, a screenshot of last month's (significantly lower) amount, and a healthy dose of righteous indignation, I call the customer care hotline.
