{"unnormalised": "Let's start with electricity. Your bill typically shows units consumed, often displayed as kWh (kilowatt-hours). The rate per unit varies based on consumption slabs. For example, the first 100 units might be charged at Rs. 3 per unit, while consumption exceeding 500 units might attract a rate of Rs. 7.50 per unit. Keep an eye out for fixed charges, often ranging from Rs. 50 to Rs. 200, irrespective of your actual consumption. These charges cover the cost of maintaining the electricity infrastructure. Fuel Adjustment Charges (FAC) or Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) costs are also usually factored in.", "normalised": "Let us start with electricity.

Many cities also levy a sewerage maintenance charge, usually a percentage of the water bill – say 30% or 50%. Check for late payment surcharges, which can quickly add up if bills aren't paid by the due date, frequently seen as a penalty of 2% per month on the outstanding amount.", "normalised": "Water bills often follow a similar tiered structure.
