{"unnormalised": "First things first: understanding the basics. The Indian currency is the Rupee, denoted as ₹ or Rs. You'll find denominations ranging from ₹1 to ₹2000. While digital payments are increasingly common, especially in urban areas, carrying some cash is still essential, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. Many local shops and vendors may only accept cash payments. Think chai stalls where you can grab a cuppa for just Rs. 10 or the auto-rickshaw walas charging Rs. 30 for a short ride.", "normalised": "First things first: understanding the basics.

{"unnormalised": "One of the first things most travellers worry about is exchanging currency. Airport exchange counters often offer less favourable exchange rates. You might end up paying a premium to exchange $100 and receive only ₹8100 instead of the actual rate, which may be ₹8300. A smarter approach is to use your debit or credit card at ATMs to withdraw cash. Look for ATMs of reputable banks like State Bank of India (SBI) or HDFC Bank. However, be mindful of transaction fees charged by your bank and the ATM. Compare the charges beforehand.", "normalised": "One of the first things most travellers worry about is exchanging currency.

{"unnormalised": "Another great option is using forex cards. You can load these cards with Rupees before your trip and use them like a debit card. They often offer better exchange rates than standard debit or credit cards, and you can lock in the rate before you travel. Plus, they're safer than carrying large amounts of cash. Just remember to check for any loading fees or usage charges.", "normalised": "Another great option is using forex cards.

Or do you prefer comfortable hotels and restaurants? A budget traveller can easily manage on ₹1500-₹2000 per day, covering accommodation, food, and local transport. Mid-range travellers can expect to spend around ₹3000-₹5000 per day, while luxury travellers can spend ₹10,000 or more.
