I'm thinking of going for about 7 days. I've roughly estimated ₹2000/day for food and local travel (auto-rickshaws mostly, maybe a bus or two). Does that sound about right? I'm also budgeting around Rs. 5000 for accommodation since I'm hoping to stay in decent but not super fancy places.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit fam, planning a trip to Kerala next month, and trying to get a handle on the budget.

Are we talking Rs. 100 per place or more like Rs. 500? Any tips on saving money on these things would be greatly appreciated! Plus, how much should I set aside for souvenirs and random shopping? I'm not a big shopper, but wouldn't mind picking up a saree or two. Thinking ₹3000 should cover that?", "normalised": "Also, what about entrance fees to various attractions?
