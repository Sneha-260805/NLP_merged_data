{"unnormalised": "Then there's the accommodation. I stayed in a mix of places. A couple of nights in a houseboat in Alleppey which cost ₹8000 per night – totally worth it, BTW.

{"unnormalised": "Food! Oh, the food. Kerala cuisine is amazing, but it adds up. I ate at some fancy restaurants (trying to be fancy myself, LOL) and some local dhabas. I'd say I spent about ₹15,000 on food overall. That includes like, a million cups of chai which were only Rs. 10 each but add up very quickly. The Karimeen Pollichathu was worth every rupee!", "normalised": "Food! Oh, the food. Kerala cuisine is amazing, but it adds up.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation within Kerala was a killer. Auto-rickshaws are cheap-ish, but they're a hassle to negotiate.
