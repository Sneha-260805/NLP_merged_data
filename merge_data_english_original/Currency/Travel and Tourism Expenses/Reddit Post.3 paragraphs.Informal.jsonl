{"unnormalised": "So, I'm planning a trip to Kerala next month, and I'm trying to budget everything out. Flight tickets are already costing me ₹8000 from Delhi, which is ouch.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation inside Kerala is also confusing me. Should I rely on autos and buses, or rent a car? Renting a car would probably be around Rs. 2000 per day, which seems steep. If I take autos, I'm guessing around Rs. 300 - Rs. 400 per day should cover local travel within cities like Kochi and Munnar? I'm trying to keep this trip within a 20000 INR budget.
