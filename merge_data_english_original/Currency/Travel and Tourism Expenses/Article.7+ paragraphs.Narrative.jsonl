{"unnormalised": "Goa. The name conjures images of sun-kissed beaches, swaying palm trees, and a vibrant nightlife. It's been on my bucket list for ages, and finally, last November, I decided to make it happen. I'm a recent college grad, so the words \"budget\" and \"travel\" were practically synonymous. I'd meticulously planned, researched, and saved every rupee I could. The official total I budgeted was ₹15000 for 7 days.", "normalised": "Goa.

{"unnormalised": "The biggest chunk of my budget went to travel. I booked a sleeper bus from Mumbai to Panjim. It was Rs. 1200 each way. A painful expenditure, but still way cheaper than a flight, which would have easily cost Rs. 4500 or more. The bus was reasonably comfortable, though the 14-hour journey felt like an eternity. I told myself I would sleep, but the bumpy roads and the constant honking made that impossible.", "normalised": "The biggest chunk of my budget went to travel.

{"unnormalised": "Accommodation was the next challenge. I opted for a hostel in Anjuna, figuring it would be a great way to meet people and save some cash. I found a decent one for Rs. 400 per night. Not bad, considering the location. My dorm room had 6 beds, and thankfully, my roommates were all friendly and respectful. One guy was from Germany, another from Bangalore, and two girls from Delhi. We ended up exploring quite a bit together, which made the experience even more fun.", "normalised": "Accommodation was the next challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Food was another area where I had to be careful. Eating at fancy restaurants was out of the question. Instead, I stuck to local shacks and street food. A plate of Goan fish curry rice cost around Rs. 150-200, depending on where I went. For breakfast, I'd usually grab a quick and cheap vada pav for Rs. 20 from a roadside stall. Chai was a must – a comforting cup of chai cost just Rs. 10. I did splurge once on a fancy seafood platter at a beachside restaurant in Calangute, which set me back Rs. 800, but it was worth it for the experience.", "normalised": "Food was another area where I had to be careful.

{"unnormalised": "Transportation within Goa was primarily done by scooter. I rented one for Rs. 300 per day. Negotiating the price was key. Initially, they quoted Rs. 500, but with a bit of haggling, I managed to bring it down. Petrol cost around Rs. 100 per liter, and I probably spent about Rs. 500 on petrol for the entire week. Driving around on the scooter was the best way to explore the hidden gems of Goa, from the secluded beaches of Arambol to the ancient churches of Old Goa.", "normalised": "Transportation within Goa was primarily done by scooter.

{"unnormalised": "Activities were kept minimal to stay within my budget. The beaches are free of course, so I spent most of my days swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing on the sand. I visited the Basilica of Bom Jesus, which has no entrance fee, and explored the vibrant markets of Anjuna and Mapusa, where I bought a few souvenirs for around Rs. 500. I also went on a spice plantation tour, which cost Rs. 700, including lunch.", "normalised": "Activities were kept minimal to stay within my budget.

{"unnormalised": "In the end, I managed to stick to my budget, though it was tight. I learned a lot about traveling smart and making the most of limited resources. Goa on Rs. 15000 for a week is definitely possible, but it requires careful planning, some sacrifices, and a willingness to embrace the local culture. Next time, I might budget Rs. 20000 just to have a little more wiggle room. But hey, that's a future me problem, right?", "normalised": "In the end, I managed to stick to my budget, though it was tight.
