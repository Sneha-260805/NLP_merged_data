{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit India, planning a trip soon and trying to budget effectively. I'm looking at a 7-day trip to Kerala, let's say. For flights from Delhi (return), I'm seeing prices ranging from ₹8000 to ₹15000 on websites like MakeMyTrip. Are those prices typical? What’s a reasonable expectation for accommodation? I’m thinking maybe ₹2000/night for a decent hotel or guesthouse. Is that realistic, or should I budget more like $50 per night?", "normalised": "Hey Reddit India, planning a trip soon and trying to budget effectively.

{"unnormalised": "Next, the big question: food. Kerala is famous for its cuisine, but how much should I budget per day? I’m not planning on super fancy restaurants, more like local eateries and the occasional splurge. Maybe Rs. 800-1200 per day? Also, transport! Is relying on auto-rickshaws okay or should I book cabs using Ola/Uber? What's the best way to get around, and what kinda expenses are we talking about daily - maybe Rs. 500?", "normalised": "Next, the big question: food.
