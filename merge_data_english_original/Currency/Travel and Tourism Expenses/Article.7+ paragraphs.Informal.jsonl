{"unnormalised": "First things first, airfare. Don't just glance at the headline price; dig deeper. Is it a direct flight, or will you be enduring a layover in Dubai at 3 AM? Does it include baggage allowance, or will you be coughing up an extra ₹3,000 for your oversized suitcase? Websites like Skyscanner and MakeMyTrip are your friends, but always check the airline's official website too. I once scored a flight to Bangkok for $250 (around ₹20,750 at today’s rates) directly from Thai Airways, cheaper than anywhere else! Keep an eye out for those flash sales around Diwali and New Year, that's when some airlines go all out.", "normalised": "First things first, airfare.

{"unnormalised": "Next up, accommodation. Hostels in Europe can be as cheap as €15 (approximately ₹1,350) a night, but don't expect luxury. Think bunk beds and shared bathrooms. Hotels, on the other hand, will easily set you back ₹3,000-₹5,000 per night, depending on the location and star rating. Airbnb is a decent middle ground, offering apartments and rooms for a more reasonable price. In India, you could find awesome homestays for around ₹2,000 a night, especially in places like Goa and Himachal. Remember to factor in the \"convenience fee\" and \"cleaning fee\" that Airbnb sneakily adds on at the end.", "normalised": "Next up, accommodation.

{"unnormalised": "Food – the highlight of any trip, right? But it's also a budget killer if you're not careful. Eating out at restaurants three times a day will quickly drain your wallet. Opt for local eateries and street food; it's cheaper and often tastier. In Thailand, you can get a plate of Pad Thai for just 50 baht (about ₹120). Pack snacks from home, especially if you're a picky eater. A packet of Parle-G goes a long way in unfamiliar territory! Allocate roughly ₹1,000-₹2,000 per day for food, depending on your eating habits and destination.", "normalised": "Food – the highlight of any trip, right?

{"unnormalised": "Transportation within the city is another expense to consider. In some cities, like Singapore, the public transport system is super efficient and affordable. A tourist pass for a week might cost around SGD 30 (roughly ₹1,800). But in other places, like Rome, you might be better off taking taxis or Ubers, especially if you're traveling in a group. Auto-rickshaws are usually the most pocket-friendly options in India, but always negotiate the fare beforehand!

{"unnormalised": "Don’t forget the miscellaneous expenses: entry fees to museums, souvenirs for your loved ones, that emergency SIM card you need when your phone decides to die on you. These can quickly add up. Set aside a contingency fund of at least 10% of your total budget for unexpected costs. Also, check if your credit card charges foreign transaction fees. Some banks levy a hefty 3.5% on every international transaction. Consider getting a forex card; it's a pre-loaded card that allows you to withdraw cash and make payments in the local currency without incurring exorbitant fees.", "normalised": "Don’t forget the miscellaneous expenses: entry fees to museums, souvenirs for your loved ones, that emergency S-I-M card you need when your phone decides to die on you.

A Schengen visa, for example, can cost around €80 (roughly ₹7,200). And don't forget travel insurance. It might seem like an unnecessary expense, but it can save you a fortune if you get sick or injured while abroad.
