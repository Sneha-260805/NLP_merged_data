{"unnormalised": "For your trip to Rajasthan, remember to budget not just for the flight tickets, which can easily be ₹15000 return from Mumbai, but also for accommodation. Decent hotels in Jaipur will cost you around Rs. 2500/night. Don't forget daily expenses! Food could be ₹800 per day, and travel within the city, say autos and taxis, might add another ₹500. Entry fees to forts and palaces can be steep – expect to pay Rs 2000 total for all the major attractions. So, for a 3-day trip, a rough estimate would be ₹15000 (flights) + ₹7500 (hotel) + ₹3900 (food and local travel) + Rs 2000 (entry fees), totaling around ₹28400. Factor in an extra 10% for unexpected expenses.", "normalised": "For your trip to Rajasthan, remember to budget not just for the flight tickets, which can easily be rupee fifteen thousand return from Mumbai, but also for accommodation.
