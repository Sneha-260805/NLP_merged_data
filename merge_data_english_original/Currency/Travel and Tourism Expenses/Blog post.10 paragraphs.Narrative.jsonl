{"unnormalised": "First things first, flights. I booked way in advance – think 3 months before – and snagged a round trip from Delhi to Kochi for around Rs. 8,000. Keep an eye out on those flash sales; airlines like Indigo and SpiceJet often have some pretty sweet deals. Also, consider flying on weekdays; Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually cheaper. My friend Priya paid almost ₹12,000 because she booked just 2 weeks before! Lesson learned.", "normalised": "First things first, flights.

{"unnormalised": "Accommodation was another big chunk of my expenses. I decided to stay in hostels whenever possible. They're a great way to meet other travellers and save a ton of cash. A bed in a decent hostel cost me about ₹500-₹800 per night. Websites like Hostelworld are your best friend for this. Hotels were tempting, especially with those picturesque views, but the budget screamed \"hostel life!\". I did treat myself to one night in a houseboat on the Alleppey backwaters, which set me back around ₹3,500. Worth every single rupee!", "normalised": "Accommodation was another big chunk of my expenses. I decided to stay in hostels whenever possible.

{"unnormalised": "Food is where Kerala truly shines, and thankfully, it's super affordable. Street food is your best bet for tasty and budget-friendly meals. Dosas, idlis, vada – you can fill your stomach for less than ₹100. Splurging on a proper Keralan thali at a restaurant will cost you around Rs. 300-Rs. 500, but it's an experience you shouldn't miss. Don’t forget the chai breaks! A small cup of chai is just Rs. 10, and it’s the perfect way to recharge after a long day of exploring.", "normalised": "Food is where Kerala truly shines, and thankfully, it's super affordable.
