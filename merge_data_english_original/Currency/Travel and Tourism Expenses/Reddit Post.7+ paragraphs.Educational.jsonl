{"unnormalised": "Specifically, I'm looking at a 7-day trip. I'm thinking of booking flights from Delhi to Kochi, and the prices I’m seeing online are around Rs. 7000-9000 per person for a round trip if I book well in advance. Is that about right? Should I expect these prices to fluctuate closer to the date, especially since it's peak tourist season? Any tips on scoring cheaper flights would be greatly appreciated!", "normalised": "Specifically, I'm looking at a seven day trip.
