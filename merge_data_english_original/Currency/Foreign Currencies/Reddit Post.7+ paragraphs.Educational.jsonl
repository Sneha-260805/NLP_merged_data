{"unnormalised": "Firstly, let’s talk about why these currencies matter. The USD (US Dollar) is pretty much the king, right? Most international trade is done in USD, so fluctuations directly impact India’s import costs. Think crude oil, electronics – things we heavily rely on. A stronger USD means we pay more INR for the same amount of stuff. Currently, $1 is roughly ₹83. That figure is always fluctuating though!", "normalised": "Firstly, let’s talk about why these currencies matter. The U-S-D (U-S Dollar) is pretty much the king, right?

A stronger U-S-D means we pay more I-N-R for the same amount of stuff. Currently, one dollar is roughly eighty three rupees. That figure is always fluctuating though!"}
{"unnormalised": "The EUR (Euro) is also a big player, especially for trade with Europe. Many Indian companies have operations in EU countries. If you're planning a trip to say, Italy, you’d want to know the EUR/INR exchange rate. Right now, €1 is approximately ₹90. Keep an eye on that if you're buying those fancy Italian shoes!", "normalised": "The E-U-R (Euro) is also a big player, especially for trade with Europe. Many Indian companies have operations in E-U countries. If you're planning a trip to say, Italy, you’d want to know the E-U-R slash I-N-R exchange rate. Right now, one euro is approximately ninety rupees. Keep an eye on that if you're buying those fancy Italian shoes!"}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the GBP (British Pound). Historically, India and the UK have strong ties, so the GBP remains relevant. Plus, many Indian students go to the UK for higher education. If you're sending money to your kid studying in London, you need to track the GBP/INR rate. Currently, £1 is around ₹105. It’s usually a bit more expensive than the Euro.", "normalised": "Then there's the G-B-P (British Pound). Historically, India and the U-K have strong ties, so the G-B-P remains relevant. Plus, many Indian students go to the U-K for higher education. If you're sending money to your kid studying in London, you need to track the G-B-P slash I-N-R rate. Currently, one pound is around one hundred and five rupees. It’s usually a bit more expensive than the Euro."}
{"unnormalised": "Don't forget the JPY (Japanese Yen). Japan is a major exporter of technology and electronics, and many Indian companies import components from Japan. The JPY/INR rate matters for those transactions. It also affects us when we buy electronics. Usually, you get lots of JPY for an INR, because it's value is lesser. As I'm writing, 1 JPY is about ₹0.56.", "normalised": "Don't forget the J-P-Y (Japanese Yen).

It also affects us when we buy electronics. Usually, you get lots of J-P-Y for an I-N-R, because its value is lesser. As I'm writing, one J-P-Y is about zero point five six rupees."}
{"unnormalised": "And lastly, given the large Indian diaspora in the UAE, the AED (UAE Dirham) is also significant. Many remittances are sent from the UAE to India. If you have relatives working in Dubai, the AED/INR rate is what determines how much money they send home. 1 AED typically hovers around ₹22-₹23.", "normalised": "And lastly, given the large Indian diaspora in the U-A-E, the A-E-D (U-A-E Dirham) is also significant. Many remittances are sent from the U-A-E to India. If you have relatives working in Dubai, the A-E-D slash I-N-R rate is what determines how much money they send home. One A-E-D typically hovers around twenty two rupees to twenty three rupees."}
