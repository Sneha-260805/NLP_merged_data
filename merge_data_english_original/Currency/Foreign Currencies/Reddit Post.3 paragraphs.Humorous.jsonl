I know the local currency is Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), but what's the deal with exchanging ₹ (INR) directly? Will those money changers near my house give me a fair rate or will I get completely looted? Someone told me it’s better to convert INR to $ first, then $ to IDR in Bali. Sounds like double the headache (and potentially double the fees!).", "normalised": "Guys, I'm planning a trip to Bali next month. Been saving up for ages!

Any advice on how to navigate this whole foreign exchange jungle would be greatly appreciated! Perhaps even a ballpark figure of what I should expect to get in IDR per 1 USD would be great. Last thing I need is some dodgy guy at the airport trying to give me 10000 IDR when it should be 15000 IDR.
