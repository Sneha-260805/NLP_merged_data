{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, need some advice. Planning a trip to Thailand in Dec and trying to figure out the best way to handle currency. I’m from Mumbai, so obviously, dealing with rupees (₹) day to day. But Thailand uses Thai Baht (THB). Should I just exchange INR to THB here before I go? I see these forex guys near CST offering rates. They quote something like ₹1 = 0.4 THB. Seems a bit low, no?", "normalised": "Hey guys, need some advice.

{"unnormalised": "Or is it better to carry USD and then convert USD to THB once I land in Bangkok? Heard that gives you a better rate usually. Plus, if I don’t spend all the USD, I can keep it for another trip, right? What’s the typical USD to THB conversion rate I should be looking for? Like, how many THB should I expect for $1? Maybe around 35 THB per 1 USD?", "normalised": "Or is it better to carry U-S-D and then convert U-S-D to Thai Baht once I land in Bangkok? Heard that gives you a better rate usually.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the whole debit/credit card thing. My SBI card has some international transaction fees. Anyone know how much they usually charge? Is it a fixed fee per transaction or a percentage? Don’t want to get hit with surprise charges after the trip. Plus, I'm worried about card fraud, especially in a new country. Should I even risk it, or is it better to stick to cash?", "normalised": "Then there is the whole debit slash credit card thing. My S-B-I card has some international transaction fees.

{"unnormalised": "Also, are ATMs in Thailand reliable? Can I just withdraw THB directly from my Indian bank account using my debit card? How much do they usually charge for that? I'm guessing it’s more than exchanging cash. Someone told me their bank charged them like ₹300 per withdrawal plus a conversion fee. That sounds steep!", "normalised": "Also, are A-T-M-s in Thailand reliable? Can I just withdraw Thai Baht directly from my Indian bank account using my debit card?

{"unnormalised": "What about these \"travel cards\" I've been seeing advertised? Axis Bank has one, and HDFC too, I think. Are they worth it? They claim lower fees and better exchange rates, but I’m skeptical. Do they really offer better rates than just converting cash at a good exchange bureau? Anyone have experience using those in Thailand? How much THB were you getting per INR or USD?", "normalised": "What about these \"travel cards\" I have been seeing advertised?

{"unnormalised": "Another thing I'm worried about is hidden fees. Like, the exchange place says they're giving a good rate, but then they sneak in some \"handling charge\" or \"service fee.\" How do I avoid getting ripped off? Should I just go to a bank branch directly, even if it's a little more inconvenient? Are their rates more transparent?", "normalised": "Another thing I am worried about is hidden fees.
