{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, quick question! Planning a trip to Thailand next month and trying to figure out the best way to handle currency. Should I exchange INR to THB here in India before I leave, or wait until I get to Bangkok? I heard the rates at Suvarnabhumi Airport are usually pretty bad. Also, roughly how much Thai Baht (THB) would be equivalent to Rs. 10,000 right now? Anyone got a recent exchange rate experience they can share?", "normalised": "Hey guys, quick question!

{"unnormalised": "My main worry is getting ripped off with terrible exchange rates. Last time I travelled internationally, I ended up paying way too much because I didn’t do my research properly. Thinking of maybe just withdrawing THB directly from an ATM in Thailand using my ICICI debit card? Is that a good idea, or will I get slammed with fees? Saw somewhere that 1 USD is around 35 THB, but I need to work out INR to THB directly.", "normalised": "My main worry is getting ripped off with terrible exchange rates.
