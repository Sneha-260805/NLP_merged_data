{"unnormalised": "Hey guys, quick question! I'm planning a trip to Sri Lanka next month (10/11/2024, super excited!), and trying to figure out the best way to handle currency. Should I exchange INR to LKR here in India, or is it better to just carry USD and convert it once I land in Colombo? I've heard conflicting things, like some folks saying you get better rates converting USD to LKR directly, while others insist on sticking to INR for \"convenience\". Anyone have recent experience? Thinking of carrying around $500 worth, maybe a bit more for shopping.", "normalised": "Hey guys, quick question!
