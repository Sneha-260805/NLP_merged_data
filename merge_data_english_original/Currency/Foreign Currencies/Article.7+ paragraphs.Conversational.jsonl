{"unnormalised": "Firstly, you gotta keep an eye on those exchange rates. They fluctuate more than Mumbai traffic! You can usually find the current rates plastered all over bank websites, online currency converters, or even just by googling something like \"1 USD to INR\". Don't just settle for the first rate you see though! Different places offer slightly different rates, so shop around. A difference of even a few paisa can add up when you're exchanging a larger sum, like ₹50,000.", "normalised": "Firstly, you have got to keep an eye on those exchange rates.

However, be wary of the fees they charge, which can sometimes be hidden. Airports, in general, are known for having the worst exchange rates, so try to avoid changing too much currency there if you can help it; enough for a taxi and maybe a quick snack.", "normalised": "Now, where to actually exchange your money?
