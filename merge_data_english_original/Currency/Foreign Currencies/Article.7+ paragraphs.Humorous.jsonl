I remember trying to calculate USD to INR conversion rates before my cousin's trip to the US.

It's a global comedy show, starring politicians, central bankers, and the occasional over-caffeinated trader. Just grab some popcorn, maybe a cup of chai, and enjoy the ride. Just don't bet your life savings on it – stick to fixed deposits, folks! Your wallet will thank you. And seriously, about that dongle...
