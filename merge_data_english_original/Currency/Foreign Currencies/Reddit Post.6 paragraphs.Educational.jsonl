Your bank or money exchange service will likely offer a slightly different rate, usually with a commission or fee baked in. So, shop around! Compare rates from different sources before you commit. My mom always tells me to check with at least 3 different banks before sending money back home.", "normalised": "First off, always remember the exchange rate is constantly fluctuating.

{"unnormalised": "Another common scenario is travelling abroad. If you're planning a trip to Europe, converting INR to EUR is essential. Let's say you need €500 for your trip. Instead of exchanging all the rupees upfront, consider using a travel credit card with minimal foreign transaction fees. You'll often get a better exchange rate and avoid hefty commissions. Also, remember to inform your bank that you will be using your card internationally, that way they won't block transactions assuming there's suspicious activity. Don't be like my cousin Rahul who was stuck in Paris because his bank blocked his card and he had to wire money over.", "normalised": "Another common scenario is travelling abroad.
