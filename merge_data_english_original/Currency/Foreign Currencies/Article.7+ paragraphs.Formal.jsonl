{"unnormalised": "For Indian companies involved in international trade, exchange rate volatility poses a considerable risk. A sudden appreciation of the INR against the USD, for instance, can reduce the competitiveness of Indian exports, making them more expensive for foreign buyers. Conversely, a depreciation of the INR can inflate the cost of imported goods and services, impacting sectors reliant on foreign inputs. For example, an Indian firm importing machinery from Germany priced in EUR could see a substantial increase in its costs if the INR weakens against the EUR. Forward contracts and other hedging instruments are often employed to mitigate these risks, but they come with their own complexities and costs.", "normalised": "For Indian companies involved in international trade, exchange rate volatility poses a considerable risk.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the tourism sector in India is directly affected by foreign currency exchange rates. A stronger INR makes India a relatively more expensive destination for foreign tourists, potentially reducing tourist arrivals. Conversely, a weaker INR can boost tourism by making India more affordable. Travel agencies and hotels constantly adjust their pricing strategies in response to currency fluctuations. For instance, a hotel room priced at $100 might cost different amounts in INR depending on the prevailing USD/INR exchange rate, which is typically displayed as something like USD/INR 83.20.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the tourism sector in India is directly affected by foreign currency exchange rates.

These remittances, primarily in USD, GBP, and AED, play a crucial role in supporting the Indian economy and providing financial assistance to families back home. The volume of remittances can be influenced by factors such as economic conditions in the host countries and exchange rate movements. A favorable exchange rate, where the INR is weaker against the currency of the host country, encourages NRIs to send more money home, as their earnings translate into a larger sum in INR.
