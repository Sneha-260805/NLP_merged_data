{"unnormalised": "Namaste, fellow travelers and budget-conscious souls! Priya here, your friendly neighborhood explorer with a penchant for getting hopelessly confused by exchange rates. I've navigated the bustling markets of Bangkok, haggled in the souks of Marrakech, and somehow managed to overpay for a cup of chai in London (yes, really!). And let me tell you, foreign currency has been the source of both incredible travel memories and truly epic facepalm moments.", "normalised": "Namaste, fellow travelers and budget-conscious souls!

{"unnormalised": "My journey into the chaotic world of foreign exchange began innocently enough. Picture this: a wide-eyed Priya, fresh off the plane in New York City, armed with a pocketful of USD and dreams of Broadway shows. Turns out, NYC prices are no joke! I thought $10 would get me a decent slice of pizza. Boy, was I wrong! I ended up splitting a tiny slice with a pigeon... the pigeon seemed happier about it than me!", "normalised": "My journey into the chaotic world of foreign exchange began innocently enough.

{"unnormalised": "Then came Europe. Oh, Europe, the land of cobblestone streets, charming cafes, and a bewildering array of currencies. First, the Euro (€). Seemed simple enough, until I tried to calculate the \"special tourist price\" a vendor was offering. My brain short-circuited trying to figure out if €20 was a good deal for a miniature Eiffel Tower. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. It broke in my bag before I even reached my hotel. Should have just stuck to shopping on Linking Road in Bandra.", "normalised": "Then came Europe. Oh, Europe, the land of cobblestone streets, charming cafes, and a bewildering array of currencies.

{"unnormalised": "The UK, bless its heart, decided to throw another wrench in the works with the Pound Sterling (£). One pound is worth approximately ₹100? Yeah, my math skills clearly deserted me at Heathrow. I distinctly remember thinking I was getting a STEAL on a box of biscuits (those custard creams are evil geniuses, I tell you). Turns out, I’d paid the equivalent of a small apartment in Mumbai for those darn biscuits! I swear, the Queen herself wouldn’t pay that much.", "normalised": "The U-K, bless its heart, decided to throw another wrench in the works with the Pound Sterling.

{"unnormalised": "Don't even get me started on the time I went to Japan and encountered the Japanese Yen (¥). The sheer number of zeroes involved gave me an existential crisis. Is ¥1000 a lot? A little? Am I suddenly a millionaire? I just nodded and smiled, hoping I wasn't accidentally buying the entire shop. Let's just say, Google Translate became my best friend (and my accountant) during that trip. My bank balance has never fully recovered.", "normalised": "Don't even get me started on the time I went to Japan and encountered the Japanese Yen.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the whole \"commission\" debacle. Banks, money changers, they all have their little fees and charges that somehow vanish into thin air. It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands! I once spent an hour haggling over a measly $2 commission fee only to realize later that I’d wasted more money on auto-rickshaw fare getting to the money changer in the first place! Facepalm. Level.

{"unnormalised": "Of course, there are the digital villains – fluctuating exchange rates! One minute, my ₹100 equals £1; the next, it's barely worth a packet of chips.

{"unnormalised": "My biggest currency-related blunder? That would be the time I accidentally tipped a street performer in Rome what I thought was a 5 Euro note. Turns out, it was a 50 Euro note.
