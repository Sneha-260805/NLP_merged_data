She'd heard horror stories about exorbitant charges levied by some banks on international transactions. “Imagine,” she said, “converting USD 1000 to EUR, only to find out that the bank has taken a chunk of it as commission!” She researched travel cards, prepaid forex cards, and even considered opening an account in a European bank, all in a desperate attempt to minimize those pesky charges.
