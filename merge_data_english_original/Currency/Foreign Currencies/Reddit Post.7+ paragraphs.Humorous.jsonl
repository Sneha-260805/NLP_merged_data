{"unnormalised": "First off, the exchange rate. It's always fluctuating more than my mood on a Monday morning. One day it's ₹2.5 for 1 Baht, the next day it's ₹2.48.

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the whole commission thing. \"Oh, we have a 'special' rate for you,\" they say with a wink. Yeah, special like a chai wala charging you ₹50 for a cup because you're a tourist. Always remember to shop around, people!

{"unnormalised": "Don’t even get me started on the mental gymnastics of trying to figure out if something is actually a good deal in Baht. \"This Pad Thai is 80 Baht... is that expensive?\" My brain short-circuited every time.

{"unnormalised": "In conclusion, exchanging Rupees for Baht is a wild ride. It's a test of your math skills, your negotiating abilities, and your ability to resist the urge to buy every single street food item you see. Worth it for the Pad Thai though. 10/10 would recommend (but maybe bring a calculator). Also, maybe a financial advisor? Just in case.", "normalised": "In conclusion, exchanging rupees for Baht is a wild ride.
