{"unnormalised": "Well, imagine reading a news report saying \"A major earthquake struck the region yesterday.\" Doesn't that leave you with questions? Yesterday could mean different things to different people reading it on different days. Specifying the exact date, say 28/10/2024, eliminates that ambiguity. It grounds the event in a concrete timeline, allowing for accurate record-keeping and future reference.

If the article simply states, \"The event occurred at 3 PM,\" readers in India (IST) will interpret that differently than someone in New York (EST). Including the time zone, e.g., \"3:00 PM PST,\" makes the information universally understandable. This is especially vital in today's interconnected world where news travels globally in seconds. Omitting it could lead to confusion and misinterpretations about the event's timeline.

{"unnormalised": "Also, specifying dates and times helps verify the story's authenticity. If a news outlet reports an event occurred on 1st Jan but evidence (like social media posts or official statements) places it on 2nd Jan, it raises red flags. Transparency is built on accuracy. Specific details let other journalists and the public cross-reference information and assess the reliability of the source.

A report about a government policy change announced at 11:59 PM on 31/03/2024, just before the end of the fiscal year, carries different implications than if it was announced a week later.
