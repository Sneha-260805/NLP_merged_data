The initial reports were chaotic, obviously, but the way the times were presented made it even harder to follow. One channel was using twenty four hour format, stating something happened at fourteen thirty hours, while another reported the same event at two thirty P-M. To someone not paying close attention, it sounded like completely different times."}

For example, some international news organizations would write \"September eleventh, two thousand and one\" as \"eleventh September two thousand and one,\" which is perfectly fine, but it caused me to pause for a moment because I'm more accustomed to the U-S style here in India. I distinctly remember reading an article where they referred to the attack on \"seventh July two thousand and five\" and needing to quickly convert that to July seventh in my head. It became second nature eventually, but during that initial news deluge, the inconsistencies felt disruptive."}

I was reading about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on \"thirteenth April nineteen nineteen\". But that would need to be easily adapted for different audiences and media formats - not to mention localized. I wish all news agencies could develop guidelines on presenting Dates and Times or follow the I-S-O eight thousand six hundred and one date and time format for communicating the exact information unambiguously. It would really help prevent so much confusion, especially in sensitive situations."}
