Shouldn’t it be more specific, like fifteenth July two thousand twenty three or July fifteenth, two thousand twenty three? A similar issue arose in a report about the I-S-R-O launch; the livestream was announced for “ten A-M,” without specifying the time zone. Is that ten A-M I-S-T, or some other time zone? This lack of clarity can be confusing, especially for readers outside India."}

The article even mentioned that the project was initially delayed from sometime in Q one two thousand twenty three until July, but didn’t have the specifics beyond that. Surely there are records of the actual dates, even if they are fluid. Imagine if historical accounts omitted specific dates, claiming things happened “sometime in the late nineteen forties.” The nuance and historical understanding would be drastically limited."}
