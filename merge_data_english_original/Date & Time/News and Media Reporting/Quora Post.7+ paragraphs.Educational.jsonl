{"unnormalised": "Why do news reports use so many different date and time formats? Isn't there a standard?", "normalised": "That is a great question! Actually, there are some standards, but news reports often deviate for a few key reasons. Primarily, it is about clarity and audience understanding. Different regions have different preferred formats. For instance, in India, you might see \"fifteenth august two thousand and twenty three\" quite often, while in the U-S, \"eighth fifteenth two thousand and twenty three\" is the norm. Using the local format makes it immediately digestible."}

A headline might say \"Blast at fourteen thirty hours,\" saving valuable characters compared to \"Blast at two thirty P-M\". Sometimes the specific format is a style choice of the publication. The Times of India might consistently use a different style compared to, say, The Hindu or N-D-T-V. This helps maintain the publication's branding and caters to its readership's expectations. You will often see this standardization within a single publication, even if it differs from other publications."}
