Like, suddenly it's two thousand and twenty four already? I swear just yesterday I was panic-buying hand sanitizer and now, boom, another election year looming. It feels like my internal clock is permanently stuck in fast forward mode. Maybe I should consult a pandit to check my *kundali* for *kaal sarp dosh* – maybe some cosmic imbalance is messing with my perception of time."}
