{"unnormalised": "One of the most prevalent challenges arises from the multitude of date formats employed. News outlets may use variations such as \"26th Jan 2024\" to commemorate Republic Day, whilst legal reporting may favour \"26/01/2024\" due to its unambiguous structure. The shortened format \"1/26/24\" is also common in online news, but can be easily misread (especially by international audiences) where day and month are inverted. Consider the headline: \"India vs. Aus Final: Game starts 2:30 PM IST\". This provides critical information but is laden with potential points of misunderstanding. The time is in 12-hour format, utilizing the abbreviation \"PM\" and includes a time zone abbreviation that may not be familiar to all readers.", "normalised": "One of the most prevalent challenges arises from the multitude of date formats employed. News outlets may use variations such as \"twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four\" to commemorate Republic Day, whilst legal reporting may favour \"twenty sixth January two thousand and twenty four\" due to its unambiguous structure.

{"unnormalised": "Time reporting presents its own set of complexities. While the 24-hour clock (e.g., \"14:30 hrs\") is often considered more precise and avoids ambiguity, the 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicators remains widely used, especially in more informal reporting. The phrase \"midnight on 31/12/2023\" could refer to either the start or end of that day, requiring careful contextual analysis. News tickers often abbreviate further, presenting times like \"10:45a\" to save space.", "normalised": "Time reporting presents its own set of complexities.

{"unnormalised": "Cultural factors also play a significant role. In India, auspicious timings like \"shubh muhurat\" are often reported alongside standard Gregorian calendar dates, adding another layer of information to decode. News about festivals will invariably include the dates, such as \"Holi celebrations begin on 25/03,\" without explicitly mentioning the year, which would require referencing context. The same occurs for events like \"Lok Sabha elections results announced on 04 Jun\".", "normalised": "Cultural factors also play a significant role.

{"unnormalised": "The implications of these unnormalized formats extend beyond readability. Automated systems relying on natural language processing (NLP) require robust normalization techniques to extract accurate data from news articles and media reports. For instance, a system tracking event timelines needs to correctly interpret \"Independence Day celebrated on 15 Aug\" or \"Budget presented on 1/2/2024\" regardless of variations.", "normalised": "The implications of these unnormalized formats extend beyond readability.
