Like, what even *is* midnight in this context? Isn't it always midnight somewhere? I read it on NDTV but honestly, it sounds like something straight outta Bollywood sci-fi. My chai almost came out my nose when I saw it.", "normalised": "Okay, so I saw this crazy news article today. Apparently, there is some kind of \"doomsday clock\" thingy?

Should I start stockpiling dal and rice? Maybe book a trip to Leh Ladakh before it's all underwater? I dunno man, seems a bit OTT.
