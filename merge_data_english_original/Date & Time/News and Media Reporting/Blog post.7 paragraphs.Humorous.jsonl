Now, you might think it is a straightforward affair. You know, stick a date, maybe a time, and boom, instant credibility. But trust me, it is a minefield. Especially when you are dealing with the Indian Standard Time (I-S-T), which, let us be honest, is more of a suggestion than a rigid rule sometimes."}

Picture this: all the news channels breathlessly announcing the landing for twenty third august two thousand and twenty three, five thirty P-M I-S-T. Then, poof! Delayed due to \"unforeseen planetary alignments,\" which, I suspect, translated to \"someone forgot to carry out the Lakshmi Puja on time\". The actual landing happened on twenty third august two thousand and twenty three but at around six zero four P-M, which led to a cascade of retractions and frantic editing. News anchors probably aged about ten years in that frantic thirty minutes."}
