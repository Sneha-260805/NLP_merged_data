{"unnormalised": "Firstly, it's important to establish the baseline. India operates on a single time zone, Indian Standard Time (IST), which is UTC+5:30. This means that IST is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. Most global news agencies use UTC as their standard, so understanding this offset is paramount.", "normalised": "Firstly, it's important to establish the baseline.

{"unnormalised": "Consider a news report stating an event occurred in New York at \"10:00 AM EST\". Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UTC-5. To understand when this event occurred in India, we need to first calculate the UTC time: 10:00 AM EST + 5 hours = 3:00 PM UTC. Then, we convert UTC to IST: 3:00 PM UTC + 5 hours 30 minutes = 8:30 PM IST. Therefore, the event occurred at 8:30 PM in India.", "normalised": "Consider a news report stating an event occurred in New York at \"ten A-M E-S-T\". Eastern Standard Time (E-S-T) is U-T-C minus five. To understand when this event occurred in India, we need to first calculate the U-T-C time: ten A-M E-S-T plus five hours equals three P-M U-T-C. Then, we convert U-T-C to I-S-T: three P-M U-T-C plus five hours thirty minutes equals eight thirty P-M I-S-T. Therefore, the event occurred at eight thirty P-M in India."}
{"unnormalised": "Often, news reports use abbreviations like \"GMT\" or \"BST\". GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is essentially the same as UTC. BST (British Summer Time) is UTC+1. Knowing these abbreviations is essential for quick conversions. For example, if a report mentions a press conference at \"2:00 PM BST\", that would be 1:00 PM UTC, and subsequently 6:30 PM IST.", "normalised": "Often, news reports use abbreviations like \"G-M-T\" or \"B-S-T\".

For example, if a report mentions a press conference at \"two P-M B-S-T\", that would be one P-M U-T-C, and subsequently six thirty P-M I-S-T."}

{"unnormalised": "Many Indian news sources are now including IST alongside other time zones in their reports to minimize confusion.
