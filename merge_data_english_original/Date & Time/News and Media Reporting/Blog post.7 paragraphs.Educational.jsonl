{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest hurdles is the variety of date formats. In India, we often see dates written as DD/MM/YYYY, like 25/12/2024 for Christmas Day next year. But news sources from the US might use MM/DD/YYYY, which would make that date December 25th, 2024. Always double-check the source's origin to understand the convention being used. If you are reading an article published in TOI (Times of India) you can be assured the date format is DD/MM/YYYY.", "normalised": "one of the biggest hurdles is the variety of date formats. in india, we often see dates written as d-d slash m-m slash y-y-y-y, like twenty five slash twelve slash two thousand and twenty four for christmas day next year. but news sources from the u-s might use m-m slash d-d slash y-y-y-y, which would make that date december twenty fifth, two thousand and twenty four. always double-check the source's origin to understand the convention being used. if you are reading an article published in t-o-i (times of india) you can be assured the date format is d-d slash m-m slash y-y-y-y."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the matter of time. You'll frequently see \"2:30 PM\" or \"14:30 hrs\". The former is the 12-hour clock format, common in everyday conversation, while the latter is the 24-hour format, often used in more formal contexts, like official reports or schedules. Remember that 1 PM is 13:00 hrs, 2 PM is 14:00 hrs, and so on. A.M. refers to ante meridiem (before noon) and P.M. to post meridiem (after noon).", "normalised": "then there's the matter of time. you'll frequently see \"two thirty p-m\" or \"fourteen thirty hours\". the former is the twelve-hour clock format, common in everyday conversation, while the latter is the twenty-four-hour format, often used in more formal contexts, like official reports or schedules. remember that one p-m is thirteen zero zero hours, two p-m is fourteen zero zero hours, and so on. a-m refers to ante meridiem (before noon) and p-m to post meridiem (after noon)."}
{"unnormalised": "Another challenge comes with relative references. News might say \"yesterday\" or \"last week.\" Understanding these requires knowing the date of publication. If an article is published on 10/11/2023 and mentions \"yesterday,\" it's referring to 09/11/2023. This can be tricky when sharing articles across time zones.", "normalised": "another challenge comes with relative references. news might say \"yesterday\" or \"last week.\" understanding these requires knowing the date of publication. if an article is published on tenth november two thousand and twenty three and mentions \"yesterday,\" it's referring to ninth november two thousand and twenty three. this can be tricky when sharing articles across time zones."}
{"unnormalised": "Speaking of time zones, understanding GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) or UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is crucial. News from abroad often uses these as a reference point. India is typically GMT+5:30, or sometimes written as UTC+5:30. So, if a news report says an event happened at 10:00 GMT, that's 3:30 PM IST (Indian Standard Time). It gets even trickier with daylight saving time, which some countries observe. For example, if an event happens at 2:00 PM EST (Eastern Standard Time) during daylight saving time, we will have to calculate for EDT(Eastern Daylight Time) which is usually GMT -4 hours.", "normalised": "speaking of time zones, understanding g-m-t (greenwich mean time) or u-t-c (coordinated universal time) is crucial. news from abroad often uses these as a reference point. india is typically g-m-t plus five thirty, or sometimes written as u-t-c plus five thirty. so, if a news report says an event happened at ten zero zero g-m-t, that's three thirty p-m i-s-t (indian standard time). it gets even trickier with daylight saving time, which some countries observe. for example, if an event happens at two zero zero p-m e-s-t (eastern standard time) during daylight saving time, we will have to calculate for e-d-t (eastern daylight time) which is usually g-m-t minus four hours."}
{"unnormalised": "Abbreviations can also be confusing. For example, \"Q1 2024\" refers to the first quarter of 2024 (January to March), a common way to reference periods in financial news. Similarly, \"FY24\" often indicates the financial year 2023-2024. Careful context analysis is vital here.", "normalised": "abbreviations can also be confusing. for example, \"q one two thousand and twenty four\" refers to the first quarter of two thousand and twenty four (january to march), a common way to reference periods in financial news. similarly, \"f-y twenty four\" often indicates the financial year two thousand and twenty three two thousand and twenty four. careful context analysis is vital here."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, pay attention to datelines. A dateline like \"New Delhi, 12/11/2023\" tells you where the news originated and when it was filed. However, the actual event might have occurred earlier. It's always wise to look for specific timestamps within the article for the most accurate timing of events.
