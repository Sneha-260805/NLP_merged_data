{"unnormalised": "Historically, Indian news outlets, both print and broadcast, have demonstrated a preference for specific date and time formats. A common approach involves presenting dates in the \"DD/MM/YYYY\" format, often accompanied by the time in a 12-hour AM/PM notation. For instance, a report might state, \"The incident occurred on 15/08/1947 at 12:00 AM.\" While this format remains prevalent, there is a noticeable increase in the adoption of the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, particularly in digital publications and online news portals.", "normalised": "Historically, Indian news outlets, both print and broadcast, have demonstrated a preference for specific date and time formats.

{"unnormalised": "This shift towards the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, often aligned with ISO 8601 standards, stems from the growing influence of international news agencies and digital content management systems. Online platforms benefit from the chronological sorting capabilities offered by this format. Furthermore, the concise nature of numerical dates lends itself well to headline writing, where space is often at a premium. The ongoing debate centres on maintaining regional preferences while embracing global standards.", "normalised": "This shift towards the \"Y-Y-Y-Y hyphen M-M hyphen D-D\" format, often aligned with I-S-O eighty six zero one standards, stems from the growing influence of international news agencies and digital content management systems.

{"unnormalised": "News organisations in India operate in multiple languages, which further complicates the standardization process. Regional language publications often adhere to localised date and time conventions, reflecting the cultural nuances of their respective regions. For example, a news bulletin in Tamil might use a different calendar system and time notation than one in Hindi. Bridging these differences requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of linguistic diversity.", "normalised": "News organizations in India operate in multiple languages, which further complicates the standardization process.

{"unnormalised": "The use of abbreviations in date and time references is also common, particularly in short-form content such as tweets and news snippets. Abbreviations such as \"Aug\" for August, \"Jan\" for January, and \"Mon\" for Monday are frequently employed.

{"unnormalised": "The inclusion of time zones in news reports is another area of variability. While Indian Standard Time (IST) is the de facto standard, it is not always explicitly mentioned. When reporting on international events, news outlets often provide the time in both IST and the local time zone of the event. This practice ensures that readers can easily understand the timing of events regardless of their location. However, inconsistencies can arise when time zone information is omitted or inaccurately presented.", "normalised": "The inclusion of time zones in news reports is another area of variability.

{"unnormalised": "Another challenge arises from the use of relative time references, such as \"yesterday,\" \"today,\" and \"tomorrow.\" While these references are convenient for conveying information quickly, they can become ambiguous over time. Online news archives, for example, require precise dates to ensure that articles can be accurately retrieved and contextualized. The use of relative time references should therefore be complemented by specific dates whenever possible.", "normalised": "Another challenge arises from the use of relative time references, such as \"yesterday,\" \"today,\" and \"tomorrow.\" While these references are convenient for conveying information quickly, they can become ambiguous over time.
