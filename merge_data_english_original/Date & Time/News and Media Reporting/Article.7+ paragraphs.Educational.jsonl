{"unnormalised": "One of the most common date formats you'll encounter is DD/MM/YYYY. For example, 15/08/1947 marks India's independence day. However, variations exist. You might see 15th Aug 1947, or even Aug 15, 1947. The key is to recognize the elements and understand their order. Newspapers might also use abbreviations like \"Sept\" for September.

{"unnormalised": "Time formats are equally important. The 12-hour clock system is prevalent, often accompanied by \"AM\" or \"PM\". So, 9:00 AM signifies 9 o'clock in the morning, while 10:30 PM denotes half past ten at night. Some reports, especially those dealing with international events, may use the 24-hour clock, where 22:00 represents 10:00 PM.", "normalised": "time formats are equally important. the twelve-hour clock system is prevalent, often accompanied by \"a-m\" or \"p-m\". so, nine o'clock a-m signifies nine o'clock in the morning, while ten thirty p-m denotes half past ten at night. some reports, especially those dealing with international events, may use the twenty four-hour clock, where twenty two hundred represents ten o'clock p-m."}
{"unnormalised": "Another essential aspect is the use of \"IST,\" which stands for Indian Standard Time. This time zone is UTC+5:30. News articles mentioning specific times without a time zone implicitly refer to IST. For instance, \"The press conference begins at 11:00 AM\" implies 11:00 AM IST. If another time zone is used, it will be explicitly mentioned, such as \"8:00 AM PST\" (Pacific Standard Time).", "normalised": "another essential aspect is the use of \"i-s-t,\" which stands for indian standard time. this time zone is u-t-c plus five hours thirty minutes. news articles mentioning specific times without a time zone implicitly refer to i-s-t. for instance, \"the press conference begins at eleven o'clock a-m\" implies eleven o'clock a-m i-s-t. if another time zone is used, it will be explicitly mentioned, such as \"eight o'clock a-m p-s-t\" (pacific standard time)."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, relative time references are common in online news. Phrases like \"2 hours ago\" or \"yesterday\" provide a quick sense of recency. \"This morning\" usually refers to the period between sunrise and noon. Be mindful of the context to understand the precise timeframe. Something that happened \"last week\" could be anywhere from 7 to 14 days prior, depending on the writer's perspective.", "normalised": "furthermore, relative time references are common in online news. phrases like \"two hours ago\" or \"yesterday\" provide a quick sense of recency. \"this morning\" usually refers to the period between sunrise and noon. be mindful of the context to understand the precise timeframe. something that happened \"last week\" could be anywhere from seven to fourteen days prior, depending on the writer's perspective."}
{"unnormalised": "In addition to standard formats, certain events have fixed dates that are widely recognized. For example, \"Republic Day\" always falls on 26/01, and \"Diwali\" varies each year according to the Hindu calendar but is generally between Oct & Nov. Understanding these cultural markers provides additional context. Similarly, fiscal years often play a role, so dates might be related to the end of a fiscal term at 31/03 of that year.", "normalised": "in addition to standard formats, certain events have fixed dates that are widely recognized. for example, \"republic day\" always falls on twenty sixth january, and \"diwali\" varies each year according to the hindu calendar but is generally between october and november. understanding these cultural markers provides additional context. similarly, fiscal years often play a role, so dates might be related to the end of a fiscal term at thirty first march of that year."}
{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember that precision varies. A news headline might say \"Floods Hit Kerala,\" while the article details events occurring over several days between 01/07 and 10/07. Look for specific dates and times within the body of the report for the most accurate information. By mastering these date and time conventions, you can confidently navigate the flow of information and gain a deeper understanding of the news landscape in India.", "normalised": "finally, remember that precision varies. a news headline might say \"floods hit kerala,\" while the article details events occurring over several days between first july and tenth july. look for specific dates and times within the body of the report for the most accurate information. by mastering these date and time conventions, you can confidently navigate the flow of information and gain a deeper understanding of the news landscape in india."}
