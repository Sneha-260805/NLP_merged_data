These errors can stem from a variety of sources, ranging from simple typographical errors to a lack of standardized formatting practices. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining the credibility and reliability of news dissemination."}

News articles may present dates as \"fifteenth August, two thousand and twenty four,\" \"August fifteenth, two thousand and twenty four,\" or \"fifteenth August, two thousand and twenty four,\" all within the same publication. This lack of uniformity can create confusion for readers, especially when dealing with international news where date conventions differ significantly. In some reports, the year may be abbreviated (e.g., 'August fifteen, two thousand and twenty four') adding another layer of ambiguity."}

Articles may use the twelve-hour clock with A-M/P-M notations (e.g., \"three thirty P-M\") or the twenty-four-hour clock (e.g., \"fifteen thirty\"), sometimes without clear indication of the time zone. Adding the zone to the value such as \"fifteen thirty I-S-T\" is helpful in this case. This is a problem when the event being discussed happens in a different country, where readers may need to calculate the time difference. News channels often flash breaking news at odd times such as \"eleven fifty seven P-M,\" which seems more arbitrary than factual."}

Phrases like \"yesterday,\" \"today,\" or \"last week\" are frequently used, but these references become ambiguous over time, especially when the news article is accessed at a later date. For example, an article published on twentieth July, two thousand and twenty four stating \"The event occurred yesterday\" leaves readers uncertain about the precise date of the event without further investigation."}

An announcement stating that \"applications are due by five zero zero P-M on thirtieth September\" may not specify the year, leading to confusion if the announcement is viewed in a subsequent year. Such omissions can have serious implications for individuals relying on this information for important decisions. The abbreviations of months, e.g., 'December' instead of 'December,' are seen widely and can be missed out."}
