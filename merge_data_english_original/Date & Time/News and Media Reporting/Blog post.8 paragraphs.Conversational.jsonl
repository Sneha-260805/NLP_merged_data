And it’s not just one outlet doing it; saw another post referencing an event happening on the fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four, which is obviously independence day, but imagine the confusion for someone not familiar with the D-D slash M-M slash Y-Y-Y-Y format we use in india."}

Trying to coordinate across different time zones is already a headache, but some news sites just make it worse.

It’s a minor thing but saves so much time!"}
