{"unnormalised": "I was chatting with a friend, Aisha, who works as a sub-editor at a leading newspaper. She was telling me how the pressure to deliver stories 'ASAP' has only intensified. Now, with the potential for AI to churn out articles in literally seconds, how do human journalists keep up, and more importantly, *should* they? The deadline used to be, say, 6 PM IST for the evening edition. What’s the deadline when the algorithm can spit out a story at 5:59:59 PM?", "normalised": "I was chatting with a friend, Aisha, who works as a sub-editor at a leading newspaper.

{"unnormalised": "This isn’t just about speed, though, right? It’s about context, nuance, and, dare I say, *truth*. Can an AI really understand the subtleties of, for example, a political rally in Lucknow that wrapped up at 11:45 PM on 22/12/2023? Can it capture the emotional weight of an event that took place at 03:00 hours in the morning, or the significance of something happening right before Diwali on 12/11/2023?", "normalised": "This isn’t just about speed, though, right?
