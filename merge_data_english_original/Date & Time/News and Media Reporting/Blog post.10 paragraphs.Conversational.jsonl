The article said the inauguration was \"scheduled for sometime next week\". Really? Next week could mean anything! Is it seventeenth july two thousand and twenty four? Or the week after? This vagueness is rampant."}

If you read a headline that says \"R-B-I announces new policy on second february two thousand and twenty four,\" are you going to know what the day is in your current timezone? Readers expect clear, concise information, especially now. When an article buries the lede with confusing date time notations, the reader is forced to look elsewhere for the answer."}

I think some blame lies with the way we present data. Some publications stick to a formal format. I think we need to be flexible, keeping in mind global audiences. For example, some Americans might be thrown off with the day day slash month month slash year year year year format. Why not write out the full date in that case?"}
