{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit, let's talk about how news outlets sometimes get dates and times… well, a bit messed up. It's not always intentional misinformation, but often just sloppy reporting, and it can really skew understanding of events, especially when covering things happening across different time zones. Think about it: a report might say something happened at \"6 PM\" without specifying if that's IST, EST, or some other time zone. Suddenly, timelines are completely off.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit, let's talk about how news outlets sometimes get dates and times… well, a bit messed up.

Is the date format unambiguous? Is there enough context to understand the timeline of events accurately?
