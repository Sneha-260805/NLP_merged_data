They said the rover, Pragyan, will be exploring the lunar surface for, like, 14 Earth days, starting from the landing date which was 23/08/2023. Can you believe it? 14 days on the MOON!", "normalised": "Okay, so I just saw this news article about the Chandrayaan three mission. It's pretty awesome, not gonna lie.

{"unnormalised": "Apparently, that 14-day period is equivalent to one lunar day. That's the time when the sun shines on that part of the moon. Once the sun sets, it's going to get super cold – something like -180°C! The article mentioned the rover and lander are solar-powered, so they'll basically go into hibernation mode when it gets dark, expected roughly around 06/09/2023, give or take.", "normalised": "Apparently, that fourteen-day period is equivalent to one lunar day.

Thinking about it, it's crazy how much planning and effort goes into these missions. They had multiple orbit raising maneuvers, lunar orbit insertion, and all that technical jazz. I'm not even sure what half of it means tbh.", "normalised": "I also read that the launch was way back on fourteenth july two thousand and twenty three at two thirty five P-M I-S-T.

{"unnormalised": "The article quoted some ISRO scientist saying that they're hoping to get a lot of data during those 14 days. They want to analyze the lunar soil, look for water ice, and just generally learn more about the moon's environment. Apparently the data will be streamed down to Earth in real-time. I wonder if they'll be showing it live online.

That's a massive achievement! Plus, it's going to inspire a whole new generation of kids to get into science and engineering. I hope there's some awesome documentaries made about it, they would get 1000000 views for sure!", "normalised": "It also said the success of this mission is a huge deal for India.
