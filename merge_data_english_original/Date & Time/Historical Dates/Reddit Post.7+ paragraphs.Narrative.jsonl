{"unnormalised": "For example, I was trying to remember when exactly was the first cricket world cup? And honestly it just blew my mind to think how long ago it actually was, like sometime in the 70s, right? According to Google, it was June 7, 1975! Whoa. Almost half a century ago! Makes me feel so old, even though I wasn't even born then.

Most people just know \"after the Kalinga War,\" but when *was* that war? A quick search revealed something like 261 BCE. BC dates mess with my head. It's kinda like I need to subtract it from some arbitary number.

Yeah but let's be specific here, because I want to see how far off I am. According to the internet the Taj Mahal was completed in 1648 AD. Pretty close! Good on me. Imagine being there on that exact day when all the workers and the artists completed working on the Taj Mahal. Must have been a pretty sight to behold.", "normalised": "Or, another random one: When was the Taj Mahal completed? I vaguely remember learning it in school. Somewhere around the seventeenth century?
