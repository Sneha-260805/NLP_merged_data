{"unnormalised": "First off, we absolutely have to talk about 15/08/1947. No surprises there, eh? That's the big one – Independence Day. At 12:00 AM, India officially became independent from British rule. Imagine the jubilation! It's still celebrated with so much enthusiasm even after all these years, with flag hoisting ceremonies and parades. My nani still remembers the sheer joy in the air that day.
