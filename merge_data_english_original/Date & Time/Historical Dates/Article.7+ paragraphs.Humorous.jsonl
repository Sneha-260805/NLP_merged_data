I’m pretty sure they invented indoor plumbing before anyone else, which is way more impressive than any old pyramids. Also, they definitely had better fashion sense. Just imagine those elaborate hairstyles! The date on that event? Maybe it was 3300 BC? Or was it earlier?

{"unnormalised": "Then came the Aryans, or were they before the Indus folks? Chronology is clearly not my forte. Anyway, they brought the Vedas, the caste system (oops!), and a whole lot of Sanskrit.
