Was it 8/8/1942 or some other date? I know it was August, but the exact date escapes me. My history teacher, Mrs. Sharma, always emphasized remembering the exact dates, but honestly, it's tough!", "normalised": "Hey guys, anyone else find history dates kinda messed up sometimes?

Pakistan's Independence Day is 14th, but India's is 15th... it is confusing. Plus, with so many other important dates like when Gandhi ji was born (2/10/1869), and when he died (30/1/1948), my brain just gets overloaded trying to keep track of everything. I just wish there was an easier way to remember all this stuff.", "normalised": "And then there's the whole thing about the Partition.
