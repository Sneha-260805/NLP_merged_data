My uncle, who lives in the US, was supposed to finalize the caterers by 20/09/2023, but the time difference made communication tricky. We ended up having video calls at odd hours – 2:00 AM IST sometimes, which was not fun. Also, the panditji kept changing the auspicious time for the ceremony! Initially, it was supposed to start at 11:00 AM, but then he moved it to 10:30 AM. Talk about stress!", "normalised": "The biggest challenge was coordinating everything from different time zones.
