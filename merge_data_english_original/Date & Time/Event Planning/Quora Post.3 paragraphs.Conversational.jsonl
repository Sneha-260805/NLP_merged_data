For a wedding, for instance, the Pandit ji usually suggests dates based on the couple's birth charts. My cousin's wedding got pushed back by 6 months just because the original date, 23/05/2024, wasn’t considered lucky enough!", "normalised": "So, someone asked about planning a big event in India, right?
