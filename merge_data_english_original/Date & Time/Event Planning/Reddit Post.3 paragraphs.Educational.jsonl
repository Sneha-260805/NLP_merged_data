{"unnormalised": "Hey Reddit, planning a big fat Indian wedding and struggling with timelines? Let me break it down. You gotta start like, 6 months (or even more!) in advance. First, nail down the auspicious date – pandits usually give a few options based on the families' birth charts. Then, book your venues ASAP. Good banquet halls in Delhi/Mumbai get booked solid, especially during wedding season (Oct-Dec and Feb-Apr). Figure out your budget early – trust me, costs escalate FAST. Get quotes from multiple caterers/decorators/photographers before finalizing anything.", "normalised": "Hey Reddit, planning a big fat Indian wedding and struggling with timelines?

Brides, go shop for that lehenga (or saree, whatever your vibe is). Grooms, figure out your sherwani/suit situation. Jewelry, too! Don't forget trousseau shopping, if that's your thing. Wedding cards need to be printed and sent out at least 6 weeks prior. Handle accommodation for out-of-town guests, esp. if they're arriving from the US or UK!
