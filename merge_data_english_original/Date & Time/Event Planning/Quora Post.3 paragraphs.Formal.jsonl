{"unnormalised": "Planning an event for a large audience across India requires careful consideration of time zones and cultural nuances. Firstly, determine the core audience's location to set a base time. India operates on a single time zone, IST (GMT+5:30), which simplifies coordination within the country. However, understanding the working hours across different cities is vital. Mumbai’s work day typically starts earlier compared to Guwahati. For pan-Indian events, aiming for a time between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM IST allows participation from most locations.", "normalised": "Planning an event for a large audience across India requires careful consideration of time zones and cultural nuances.

{"unnormalised": "Cultural observances are critical. Avoid scheduling major events during significant Hindu festivals like Diwali (usually in Oct/Nov) or Holi (typically in March), when participation might be lower. Similarly, consider Islamic holidays like Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha, and Sikh festivals like Gurpurab. A detailed Indian holiday calendar for the year, readily available online, is an essential reference. Check for regional variations; for example, Onam in Kerala (Aug/Sep) or Durga Puja in Kolkata (Oct) may impact local participation.", "normalised": "Cultural observances are critical.

Clearly communicate the date and time in IST, along with options to view it in other time zones. For instance, specifying \"Event: 26/01/2025, 12:00 PM IST\" alongside a time zone converter link enhances accessibility. Buffer time is also essential.
