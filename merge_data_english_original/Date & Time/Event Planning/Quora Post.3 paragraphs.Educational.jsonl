First, pandits usually look at birth charts to determine the shubh mahurat, that's the auspicious date and time. Dates like 14/01 (Makar Sankranti) or festivals can be good starting points, but you absolutely need the Pandit ji's approval. Plus, you'll need to consider availability of venues and vendors if you're planning around peak season like Oct-Nov (Diwali time).", "normalised": "So, someone asked about planning the perfect Indian wedding?
