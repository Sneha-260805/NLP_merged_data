A lot of people prepone or postpone events based on auspicious days, according to the Hindu calendar (Panchang). So, first check for major festivals like Diwali (usually falls in Oct/Nov), Holi (March), Eid (date varies based on the Islamic calendar), or Christmas (25/12). These dates are often already booked solid for venues and vendors.", "normalised": "Okay, so you are planning an event in India and need help with dates and times, right?
