{"unnormalised": "However, several team members have voiced their displeasure. Apparently, 4:30 PM on a Friday is sacrosanct. People want to head home early, beat the Bangalore traffic which starts escalating around 5:00 PM, start their weekend, spend time with family, etc. I understand these sentiments, but the project is critical, and we need to be on top of things.
