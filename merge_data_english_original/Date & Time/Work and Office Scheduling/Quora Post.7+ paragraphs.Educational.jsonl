{"unnormalised": "One frequent problem is the ambiguous way some dates and times are written. For example, if someone says \"Meeting on 5/6,\" does that mean May 6th or June 5th? In India, both formats are used, leading to potential mix-ups. To avoid this, always clarify, write the month in full (e.g., \"May 6th\" or \"6th May\"), or explicitly use the format \"DD/MM/YYYY\" or \"MM/DD/YYYY\" and mention which format you're using. This seems basic, but can save a lot of headaches.", "normalised": "One frequent problem is the ambiguous way some dates and times are written.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the issue of holidays and festivals. India has a plethora of public and regional holidays. What one state celebrates might be a regular working day in another. Before scheduling important meetings or deadlines, always check the calendar for national holidays like Republic Day (26/01), Independence Day (15/08), and Gandhi Jayanti (02/10), as well as major festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Eid. Being mindful of these dates shows respect and avoids scheduling conflicts.", "normalised": "Then there is the issue of holidays and festivals. India has a plethora of public and regional holidays.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing to consider is flexibility. The concept of \"Indian Standard Time\" often comes with a humorous, albeit frustrating, connotation of slight delays. While punctuality is essential, especially in professional settings, it's helpful to factor in a small buffer, especially for meetings involving travel or multiple participants. A 10-15 minute grace period can be a lifesaver. So, If a meeting is scheduled for 11:00 AM, expect some attendees to arrive closer to 11:10 AM or 11:15 AM.", "normalised": "Another thing to consider is flexibility.

While many companies operate on a standard 9 AM to 5 PM schedule, it's worth confirming if the person you're meeting has different working hours, especially if they work in a different industry or role.

{"unnormalised": "Let's talk about using digital tools. While many modern offices use calendar apps and scheduling software, not everyone is tech-savvy.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, always confirm meeting details a day or two in advance. A simple reminder email or message re-stating the date, time, location (physical or virtual), and agenda can prevent last-minute cancellations or no-shows. For example: \"Reminder: Meeting on 28/07/2024 at 10:30 AM IST via Google Meet to discuss project progress.\" Double-checking takes only a minute and minimizes potential disruptions.
