{"unnormalised": "One major challenge is definitely accounting for Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. It's easy to forget when setting up calls with the London office, leading to someone dialing in at 2:30 AM their time! I once accidentally scheduled a client call for 11:30 PM IST, only to realize my mistake when I got a frantic call at 11:15 PM from a very sleepy client.

I had a team lead once prepone a meeting on Holi, thinking no one would mind. Safe to say, the turnout was… minimal.", "normalised": "Then there's the whole world of Indian holidays to consider.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing that can throw a wrench in the works is the \"Indian Stretchable Time,\" or IST as some jokingly call it. Punctuality isn't always strictly adhered to, and a meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM might realistically start around 10:15 AM. Building in a little buffer time can be a lifesaver.
