It all started with the best intentions, really. I envisioned waking up at six thirty A-M sharp, meditating for thirty minutes (thanks, Headspace!), and then diving headfirst into work by seven thirty A-M. The reality? Snooze button city until at least eight fifteen A-M. Some habits die hard, even when your commute is literally from the bed to the desk."}

Scheduled, of course, but still! I had a crucial client call at nine A-M, and naturally, the electricity decided to take a vacation precisely at eight fifty eight A-M. Cue frantic tethering to my phone's hotspot, praying the connection would hold. It didn't. Rescheduled for eleven A-M. Lost a good half-hour trying to explain to the client that \"bijli chali gayi\" isn't a valid business excuse everywhere in the world."}

I emailed my team lead asking if we could shift the three P-M huddle to one thirty P-M. Got a reply saying \"Sure, if everyone's okay with it.\" Everyone wasn't. So, I juggled a slightly uncomfortable but thankfully brief consultation with Doctor Sharma, followed by racing back home to dial into the meeting at three zero seven P-M, already feeling frazzled. Note to self: Never prepone, only postpone."}

A delivery guy at ten forty five A-M wanting a signature for something I didn't order.

The joys of working from “home”."}

It was supposed to be submitted by five P-M, and I remembered it only at four fifteen P-M.

Maybe I should start using a physical planner instead of relying on Google Calendar."}
