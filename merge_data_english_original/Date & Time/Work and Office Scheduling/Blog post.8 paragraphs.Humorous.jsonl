Scheduling a meeting in an Indian office is less about coordinating calendars and more about navigating a minefield of unforeseen circumstances. It's a uniquely Indian art form, a chaotic dance of \"tentative\" and \"please confirm A-S-A-P\" that would make even the most seasoned project manager weep."}

You propose fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four, a perfectly reasonable Thursday, right? Wrong! Turns out it's someone's cousin's cat's birthday (or something equally vital), and they absolutely *cannot* be disturbed before four thirty P-M. Then there's the inevitable power cut. You planned a critical presentation for eleven zero zero A-M? Hope you enjoy shouting over the drone of the generator. Because, you know, *India*."}
