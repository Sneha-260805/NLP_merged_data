{"unnormalised": "One of the first things to consider is the prevalence of fixed holidays, both national and regional. It's important to note that Diwali falls on different dates each year; this year, it's on 31/10/2024. Republic Day is always on 26/01. Religious festivals like Eid and Gurupurab also shift annually, so HR needs to keep a keen eye on the Govt. holiday calendar. This impacts planning significantly, often requiring employees to prepone tasks to meet deadlines. Remember, checking the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions website is usually the best bet for accurate information on gazetted holidays.", "normalised": "One of the first things to consider is the prevalence of fixed"}
{"unnormalised": "Scheduling meetings across different offices within India can be tricky. Consider the time difference between Guwahati and Mumbai; there might be only a short overlap in working hours. If you're scheduling a meeting with an office in the UK or US, convert the time to IST beforehand. \"Can we have a call at 4 PM GMT?\" needs to be translated into its IST equivalent to see if it is feasible for the Indian team. Tools like Google Calendar or World Time Buddy are invaluable for this.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Another essential aspect is factoring in travel time, especially in cities like Bengaluru or Kolkata. A meeting scheduled for 2 PM might require employees to leave their previous engagement much earlier due to traffic congestion. Also, recognize the 'chai break' culture. Many offices have scheduled or impromptu breaks around 11:00 AM or 4:00 PM, so it's best to avoid scheduling critical discussions during these times to ensure everyone's full attention.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Remember, a significant portion of the workforce relies on public transport. Train delays or bus strikes can impact punctuality. It's wise to build some buffer time into the schedule, particularly for important presentations or client meetings. Instead of scheduling the presentation sharp at 10:00 AM, consider 10:15 AM to account for potential delays. Moreover, be mindful of the monsoon season in certain regions. Flooding can disrupt commutes, causing delays and affecting attendance.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "Flexibility is paramount. Indian culture often prioritizes personal commitments and family obligations. Employees might need to prepone or postpone meetings due to unforeseen circumstances. A rigid scheduling policy might not always be effective. Encourage employees to communicate any scheduling conflicts well in advance so that alternative arrangements can be made without disrupting the entire workflow.", "normalised": ""}
{"unnormalised": "By keeping these considerations in mind, you can create a work schedule that is both efficient and respectful of the Indian cultural context. Prioritizing clear communication, flexibility, and an understanding of local nuances will go a long way in optimizing productivity and fostering a harmonious work environment. So, next time you're planning a project that must be completed by 31/12, remember these tips, and your chances of success will increase manifold!", "normalised": ""}
