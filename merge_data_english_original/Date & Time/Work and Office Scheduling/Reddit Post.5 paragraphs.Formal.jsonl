{"unnormalised": "The main problem is integrating different departments' schedules. Marketing, Sales, and Engineering are all on different project timelines, and their availability fluctuates. The software struggles to handle recurring meetings effectively. If a meeting is scheduled for every Tuesday at 10:00 AM IST, and someone cancels one instance, it sometimes deletes the entire series. This leads to a lot of confusion and back-and-forth emails to confirm meeting times. Also, the time zone settings are off. Some users are seeing meeting invites in GMT+0, when we're all supposed to be on IST.", "normalised": "The main problem is integrating different departments' schedules.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, the system doesn’t account for 'preponing' or 'postponing' meetings as is common practice here. We often need to shift meeting times at short notice, and the software makes it difficult to reschedule without creating conflicts or double bookings. I've suggested we look into alternative solutions that are more user-friendly and better suited to our work culture. Maybe something that automatically syncs with Google Calendar or MS Outlook would be better, but I am looking for suggestions.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the system does not account for 'preponing' or 'postponing' meetings as is common practice here.

{"unnormalised": "One of my colleagues suggested using shared spreadsheets to track everyone's availability, but that seems like a step backward. It might work for a small team, but with over 50 employees, it would quickly become unmanageable. We need a centralised, automated system that can handle complex schedules and time zone differences. The current software also has a bug where it's automatically scheduling meetings for 2 hours, even if I select 30 mins.", "normalised": "One of my colleagues suggested using shared spreadsheets to track everyone's availability, but that seems like a step backward.

What solutions have you found effective for managing team availability and meeting room bookings in an Indian office setting?
