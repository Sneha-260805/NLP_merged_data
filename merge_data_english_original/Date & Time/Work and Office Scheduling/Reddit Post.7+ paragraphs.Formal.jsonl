Like, almost every meeting starts five to ten minutes behind schedule. It's eating into our productivity, especially when we have back-to-back calls. It's not just one or two people; it's pretty widespread. I have colleagues joining from multiple locations like Mumbai, Chennai, and even from abroad, so respecting their time becomes even more crucial."}

If you're not there by ten A-M (or whatever the stated time is), you miss the intro and background. Latecomers won't be caught up unless it's absolutely critical. If the scheduled time for the meeting is between fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred, I expect everyone to respect it."}

One colleague, Ravi, complained that sometimes things come up unexpectedly – client calls running over, traffic delays, urgent emails. Another, Priya, said it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to be perfectly punctual all the time, especially given the pressure we're under to prepone deadlines. And honestly, with the frequent power cuts we have here, joining at sharp nine thirty A-M can be challenging. I understand that."}
