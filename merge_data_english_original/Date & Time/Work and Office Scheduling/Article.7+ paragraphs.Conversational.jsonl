Rakesh has a doctor's appointment on 10/10/2024 in the afternoon. Aisha’s already booked for a client call on Wed at 11 AM.

{"unnormalised": "Then comes the confusion about time zones. We have teams spread across Mumbai, Delhi, and even some folks working remotely from the US. Setting up a call at 2:00 PM IST might mean someone on the West Coast has to join at 4:30 AM PST. Not ideal, right? We try to be mindful, but sometimes, deadlines are deadlines. I once accidentally scheduled a meeting for the team at 3:30 am because I forgot to convert the timings.", "normalised": "Then comes the confusion about time zones.
