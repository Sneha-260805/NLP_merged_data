Here, things are a little… more fluid. We operate on IST (Indian Stretchable Time), so that 9:00 AM call might actually start closer to 9:30 AM. And don't even get me started on \"ASAP\" - that could mean anything from today to next week, depending on who you ask!

{"unnormalised": "Despite the chaos and occasional frustration, there's a certain charm to the Indian way of scheduling. It's a reminder that sometimes, the best-laid plans are meant to be… well, slightly adjusted. So, embrace the flexible deadlines, the \"urgent\" requests, and the inevitable calendar clashes. Just remember to factor in a healthy dose of chai breaks and a whole lot of patience. After all, in India, time is a suggestion, not a rule.", "normalised": "Despite the chaos and occasional frustration, there's a certain charm to the Indian way of scheduling.
