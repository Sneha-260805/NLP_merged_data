My boss, Mister Sharma, wants to prepone the team meeting to ten A.M. tomorrow, sixteenth May two thousand and twenty four. But I've already scheduled a crucial vendor call for ten thirty A.M. that day. This call has been fixed since last week, ninth May two thousand and twenty four and it's super important for the upcoming project. Plus, Priya from marketing also has a client demo scheduled for eleven A.M. on sixteenth May. If we prepone the meeting, it will overlap with both our schedules. What should I do? Should I tell Mister Sharma about the scheduling conflicts, or just try to reschedule my vendor call? I'm kinda in a pickle 'cause both are important. Any suggestions or past experiences would be greatly appreciated! Maybe I should suggest postponing the meeting altogether to seventeenth May at two P.M.? That might give everyone some breathing room and avoid the clashes. Let me know your thoughts, guys! Need some help navigating this office scheduling madness. Thanks in advance!"}
