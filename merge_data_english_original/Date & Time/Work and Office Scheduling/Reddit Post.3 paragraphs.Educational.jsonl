{"unnormalised": "A lot of folks seem confused about how to handle deadlines and meetings, especially when dealing with our global teams. So, lemme break down some tips that have helped me avoid a lot of \"oops\" moments. First, always, *always* clarify the time zone. A 3 PM meeting in Delhi (IST) isn't the same as 3 PM in London (GMT) or New York (EST). Use a tool like World Time Buddy to convert, even if you think you know it. Saves you from waking up at 3 AM for a meeting you thought was at 10 AM.", "normalised": "A lot of folks seem confused about how to handle deadlines and meetings, especially when dealing with our global teams.

This also applies to scheduling meetings – back-to-back meetings from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM with no breaks is a recipe for burnout.", "normalised": "Next, pre-pone things rather than postpone them if you can.

If a task is assigned with a deadline of 1 week, confirm that with the assignee and put it in writing. A simple spreadsheet or project management tool can make a huge difference.
