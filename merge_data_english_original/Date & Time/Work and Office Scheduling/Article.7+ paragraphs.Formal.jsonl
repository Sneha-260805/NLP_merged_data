{"unnormalised": "One significant hurdle is inconsistent date formats. While the international standard dictates YYYY-MM-DD, many Indian offices still utilize DD/MM/YYYY. This can lead to misunderstandings, particularly when scheduling conference calls with international partners or setting deadlines for project deliverables. For example, a deadline of 02/03/2025 (February 3rd or March 2nd?) needs immediate clarification to avoid costly errors. Standardizing date formats across departments using unambiguous notations like 2nd March 2025 or Mar 2, 2025 is essential.", "normalised": "One significant hurdle is inconsistent date formats. While the international standard dictates Y-Y-Y-Y dash M-M dash D-D, many Indian offices still utilize D-D slash M-M slash Y-Y-Y-Y.

{"unnormalised": "Another common issue stems from the varied observance of public holidays. While national holidays such as 15/08 (Independence Day) and 26/01 (Republic Day) are universally observed, regional and religious holidays can differ significantly between states. A company with offices in Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai must ensure that scheduling takes into account local festivals like Durga Puja in October or Pongal in January. A centralized holiday calendar, accessible to all employees and meticulously updated, is crucial.", "normalised": "Another common issue stems from the varied observance of public holidays.

{"unnormalised": "Time zone differences also present unique problems. When scheduling meetings or conference calls with overseas clients, particularly those in the US, the UK or Australia, diligent consideration of time zone variations is paramount. A meeting scheduled for 3:00 PM IST may be in the middle of the night for colleagues in New York. Utilizing scheduling tools that automatically convert time zones or clearly specifying the time zone abbreviation (e.g., GMT+5:30 for Indian Standard Time) are key to avoiding confusion and ensuring participation.", "normalised": "Time zone differences also present unique problems.

{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, incorporating a 'buffer' into schedules is important. Indian traffic conditions are often unpredictable. Planning for a meeting at 10 AM, with a commute that Google Maps suggests takes 30 minutes, doesn't account for potential delays due to road closures or congestion. Building in an extra 15-20 minutes can mitigate the risk of tardiness and subsequent disruptions. Consider also the preponing of meetings, quite common in Indian businesses, and the need for flexible schedules that can adapt to last-minute changes.", "normalised": "Furthermore, incorporating a 'buffer' into schedules is important.

If an employee is unavailable on a particular date or time, they should promptly inform the meeting organizer to explore alternative arrangements.
