For example, if you're scheduling a team meeting on 14/01, be mindful it might clash with Makar Sankranti celebrations in some states. Similarly, major festivals like Diwali, which usually falls sometime in Oct/Nov, require planning well in advance to accommodate employees' leave requests. Check for regional govt. holidays as well.", "normalised": "One thing that really helps is acknowledging regional holidays.

{"unnormalised": "Another challenge is coordinating across different time zones within India itself. While we technically operate under IST (Indian Standard Time), there can be communication delays if your team is spread across different regions. Remember, some colleagues might start their day earlier or later, especially in the North-East region where sunrise happens significantly earlier than in Gujarat. Scheduling a meeting at, say, 9:00 AM IST might not be ideal for everyone.", "normalised": "Another challenge is coordinating across different time zones within India itself.

{"unnormalised": "Then, there's the cultural aspect of work hours. Some prefer to \"prepone\" meetings rather than postpone if something urgent comes up. Others might be more comfortable discussing work matters over chai breaks, which, while informal, can be incredibly productive. You also need to consider that family commitments are often prioritised. So, requesting someone to stay back till 8 PM on a weekday might be met with resistance.", "normalised": "Then, there's the cultural aspect of work hours.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, utilize scheduling tools that integrate well with Indian calendars. Google Calendar, with its holiday pack options, is a good start. But also explore project management tools that allow for task assignment and deadlines with built-in reminders. Setting clear deadlines, like \"End of Day (EOD) 27/07/2024\", and using communication platforms like WhatsApp for quick updates can significantly improve coordination and reduce scheduling conflicts.
