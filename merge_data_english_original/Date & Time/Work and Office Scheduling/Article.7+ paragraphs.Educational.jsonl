{"unnormalised": "One of the initial steps towards better time management is understanding the nuances of the Indian work culture. For instance, meetings often tend to start late. While the officially scheduled time might be 11:00 AM, it's not uncommon for things to get underway closer to 11:15 AM, or even 11:30 AM, due to various factors like traffic congestion in cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai, or the prevalent \"Indian Stretchable Time\" (IST) concept. Factoring this inherent delay into scheduling is crucial. Buffer time must be accommodated in your plans.", "normalised": "One of the initial steps towards better time management is understanding the nuances of the Indian work culture.

{"unnormalised": "Another essential aspect to consider is the impact of holidays and festivals. India, being a land of diverse cultures and religions, has a plethora of festivals throughout the year. Scheduling important meetings around major holidays like Diwali (typically in Oct/Nov), Holi (usually in March), or Eid can be unproductive as many employees may be on leave or observing the festivities. A quick check of the Indian national and regional holiday calendar (available online) before finalizing schedules is highly recommended.", "normalised": "Another essential aspect to consider is the impact of holidays and festivals.

{"unnormalised": "Effective communication is also paramount. Before scheduling a meeting or assigning a task, clearly define the objectives and deliverables. Use concise language and avoid ambiguity. For example, instead of vaguely stating “discuss the project,\" specify \"discuss the project timeline, budget, and resource allocation.\" Send out meeting agendas at least 24 hrs in advance.", "normalised": "Effective communication is also paramount.

{"unnormalised": "Technology plays a significant role in modern scheduling. Utilize calendar apps like Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, or Zoho Calendar, popular choices in Indian companies. These tools allow you to share your availability, schedule recurring meetings, set reminders, and track deadlines. Integrating these with project management software can further streamline workflow. For instance, if a report is due on 18/12/2024, you can set reminders one week and one day prior.", "normalised": "Technology plays a significant role in modern scheduling.

{"unnormalised": "Prioritization is key to managing workload efficiently. Apply methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important) to categorize tasks. Focus on high-impact activities first. Avoid getting bogged down in minor, time-consuming tasks. Delegate effectively if possible. If a task can be done by someone else, assign it to them, freeing up your time for more strategic endeavors.", "normalised": "Prioritization is key to managing workload efficiently.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember to schedule in breaks. Working continuously without respite can lead to burnout and reduced productivity. Aim for short breaks every 1-2 hrs. A 15-min chai break can do wonders for rejuvenating the mind. Likewise, don’t schedule back-to-back meetings without allowing for transition time. This allows you to collect your thoughts, prepare for the next engagement, and avoid rushing from one thing to the next. For example, blocking from 10:00AM-10:10AM as break time between back to back meetings can be very useful. Implementing these strategies will lead to better time management and improved performance in the Indian work environment.", "normalised": "Finally, remember to schedule in breaks.
