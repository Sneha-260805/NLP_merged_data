And let me tell you, scheduling meetings across time zones, especially when involving international colleagues, is a special kind of challenge. It’s not just about converting times; it’s about understanding the nuances of “Indian Stretchable Time” and the occasional insistence on holding calls at absolutely bonkers hours."}

We had a crucial project kickoff with the team in New York. The meeting was scheduled for nine thirty P-M I-S-T. I remember setting multiple alarms because, you know, sleep. Of course, then the meeting got \"preponed\" (Indian English for moved earlier) to eight P-M I-S-T at the last minute – thanks to some \"urgent\" matter on the U-S side that couldn’t possibly wait. I survived, fueled by copious amounts of chai."}

It was set for eleven A-M S-G-T, which translated to eight thirty A-M I-S-T. Seemed reasonable enough, right? Except, it coincided perfectly with peak Mumbai traffic.

The initial plan was to have the final check-in call at four P-M G-M-T. That's nine thirty P-M I-S-T, prime family dinner time. After a minor revolt from the Indian team (who reasonably wanted to, you know, eat with their families), we managed to push it back to six P-M G-M-T (eleven thirty P-M I-S-T). Progress, I guess."}

We had scheduled a team catch-up on fourth November two thousand twenty one, blissfully unaware that it was the day of Lakshmi Puja, a major part of Diwali celebrations.

Now, I usually send out a Google Calendar poll to gauge team availability."}

Patience, flexibility, and a healthy dose of humor are essential. And a good time zone converter, of course.
