{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest hurdles is definitely the time difference. Trying to find a slot that works for folks in Kolkata (GMT+5:30) and someone calling in from, say, London (GMT+0) means a whole lot of juggling.

Something that automatically converts time zones, considers holidays, and ideally, integrates with everyone's Google Calendar. Polls also work really well.
