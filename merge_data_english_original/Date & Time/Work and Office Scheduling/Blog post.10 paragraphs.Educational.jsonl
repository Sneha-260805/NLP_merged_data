{"unnormalised": "First, let's talk about embracing digital tools. While the good old paper diary has its charm, software and apps designed for scheduling are a game-changer. Think Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook Calendar, or even specialized project management software. These tools allow you to share your availability, set reminders, and collaborate with your team seamlessly. Plus, they automatically adjust for time zones, which is crucial when working with clients or colleagues overseas. For instance, if your colleague in the US schedules a meeting for 9:00 AM EST, the calendar will automatically convert it to 6:30 PM IST.", "normalised": "First, let us talk about embracing digital tools.

{"unnormalised": "One common pitfall is underestimating the time required for tasks. We often tend to optimistically believe we can complete something in 30 mins, when it realistically needs 1 hour. Be realistic about the time commitment involved for each task. Buffer in some extra time for unforeseen delays, especially in a dynamic environment. A good rule of thumb is to add a 15-min buffer to every hour scheduled.", "normalised": "One common pitfall is underestimating the time required for tasks.

{"unnormalised": "Prioritization is key. Not all tasks are created equal. Identify your most important tasks for the day, week, or month and schedule them accordingly. The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) is a great tool for this. Focus on completing the urgent and important tasks first. Less critical tasks can be delegated or pushed back. For instance, attending that optional webinar on 27/10/2024 can be shifted if you have a critical deadline for a client presentation.", "normalised": "Prioritization is key.

Many businesses operate across different regions of India, each with its unique working culture and peak productivity hours. Be mindful of religious holidays and festivals as well.

{"unnormalised": "Pro tip: batch similar tasks together. Instead of switching between different types of work throughout the day, group similar activities. For example, dedicate a block of time, say 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, solely for responding to emails.
