Navigating the Indian office calendar is less about productivity and more about sheer survival. It's a battlefield where deadlines shift faster than the monsoon winds and meetings get \"preponed\" with the frequency of chai breaks. And let’s not even talk about the scheduling software – usually something from the late nineties that only understands dates in the D-D slash M-M slash Y-Y-Y-Y format, causing international colleagues to stare blankly at their screens."}
