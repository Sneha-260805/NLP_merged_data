It's more of a suggestion, a playful notion to be molded and bent to the whims of chai breaks, impromptu meetings, and the eternally optimistic phrase, \"Just 5 minutes, boss.\" Scheduling a meeting? Prepare for a cosmic dance of prepone-ments and postpone-ments, where the only certainty is uncertainty. Take, for instance, the weekly team meeting. Originally slated for 10:00 AM on 16/09/2024, it’s already been rescheduled thrice, tentatively landing on 17/09/2024 at \"somewhere after lunch\".", "normalised": "In the hallowed halls of Indian offices, time isn't a linear concept.

Meetings will be paused, deadlines will be overlooked, and entire departments will grind to a halt for that sweet, milky nectar of productivity.
