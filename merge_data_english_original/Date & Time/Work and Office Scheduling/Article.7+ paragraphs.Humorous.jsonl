{"unnormalised": "Let's face it, folks. In India, time is more of a suggestion than a rigid constraint. Especially in the office. Scheduling a meeting at, say, 10:00 AM? Bless your optimistic heart. You're practically inviting chaos. The real start time? Closer to 10:15 AM, minimum. We like to call this the Indian Standard Time (IST) stretch. A 10 o’clock meeting translates to 10:15am plus buffer for chai break (10-15 mins) and another 5 mins for random catch up, totalling 10:35am.", "normalised": "Let us face it, folks.

{"unnormalised": "It's not just about deliberate tardiness, though. Oh no, it's a complex tapestry woven with cultural nuances, traffic woes, and the ever-present \"urgent work\" that always seems to pop up five minutes before any scheduled event. Blame it on the monsoon traffic. Blame it on the power cut (scheduled or otherwise). Blame it on your colleague who got stuck in an auto-rickshaw jam. Whatever the reason, arriving precisely at 10:00 AM is practically an act of rebellion.", "normalised": "It is not just about deliberate tardiness, though.
