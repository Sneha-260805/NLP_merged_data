{"unnormalised": "One of my biggest challenges was scheduling meetings. I’d often find myself in situations where I’d have 3 meetings all scheduled within the same 2-hour window. For example, one memorable Tuesday, I had a client call scheduled for 11:00 AM, followed by a team meeting at 11:30 AM, and then another urgent call with my manager slotted for 12:00 PM. It was impossible to attend all three effectively. I learned the hard way that I needed to prepone or postpone meetings as needed, and to block out travel time, even for just going from one floor to another!", "normalised": "One of my biggest challenges was scheduling meetings.

{"unnormalised": "Then there were the Indian Standard Time (IST) nuances. Trying to coordinate with international teams proved to be its own unique brand of chaos. We’d have conference calls scheduled for 8:00 PM IST, which meant I was stuck in the office until late, missing dinner with my family. Or sometimes, the confusion would be worse. Like when a team member thought the meeting was scheduled for 9:30 GMT, not realising it needed to be converted to IST – leading to a missed crucial project discussion. I once even mixed up a project timeline and scheduled my Diwali vacation right when the project was due, 11/11/2024. That did not go down well with my boss!", "normalised": "Then there were the Indian Standard Time (I-S-T) nuances.

{"unnormalised": "Another hurdle was balancing work with personal commitments. In India, festivals like Diwali, Holi and Eid are incredibly important. Taking time off during those periods is non-negotiable for many families. I quickly learned to plan my work around these events, ensuring that critical deadlines didn't clash with the festive season. I had to start requesting vacation time well in advance, like 6 months ahead of Durga Puja.", "normalised": "Another hurdle was balancing work with personal commitments.

{"unnormalised": "What truly helped me was using a digital calendar religiously. I'd block out specific time slots for different tasks, including lunch breaks and even short chai breaks.
