{"unnormalised": "Managing schedules effectively in India requires navigating a unique blend of local customs and international standards when it comes to date and time. Unlike some Western countries, India commonly uses the DD/MM/YYYY date format. This means 05/07/2024 indicates the 5th of July, 2024, not May 7th. This is crucial for scheduling meetings, deadlines, and project milestones to avoid confusion. Remember, misinterpreting dates can lead to missed deadlines and operational hiccups.", "normalised": "Managing schedules effectively in India requires navigating a unique blend of local customs and international standards when it comes to date and time.

{"unnormalised": "Time notations also present considerations. While many Indian offices are adopting the 24-hour clock for internal communications and scheduling systems (e.g., 17:00 for 5 PM), the 12-hour clock with AM/PM designations remains prevalent in casual conversations and certain formal settings. You might hear someone say, \"The meeting is at 3 PM,\" which is perfectly acceptable, but clarifying expectations is always best to avoid misunderstandings. It is important to understand which notation your colleagues prefer.", "normalised": "Time notations also present considerations.

{"unnormalised": "Cultural nuances further complicate scheduling. Punctuality, while generally valued, is sometimes approached with a degree of flexibility. Traffic delays in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore are common, and a slight buffer should be considered when scheduling meetings, especially if participants are traveling from different parts of the city. A meeting slated for 11:00 AM might realistically begin closer to 11:15 AM. Preplanning for travel time will save you time and frustration.", "normalised": "Cultural nuances further complicate scheduling.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, Indian offices often observe a mix of national and regional holidays. Diwali, Holi, Eid, and Christmas are all widely recognized, impacting office closures and work schedules. Regional festivals, such as Onam in Kerala or Durga Puja in West Bengal, may also affect the availability of team members. Always consult an official holiday calendar, or even better, check with your team about major festivals that may impact deadlines.", "normalised": "Moreover, Indian offices often observe a mix of national and regional holidays.
