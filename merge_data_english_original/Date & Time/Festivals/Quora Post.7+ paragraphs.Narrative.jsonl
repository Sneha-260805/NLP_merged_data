It all starts with Holika Dahan, right? Usually the night before Holi, which this yr falls on 25/03/2024. We’d gather around this massive bonfire, chanting prayers and throwing coconuts and other stuff into the fire.

Gulal, abir, all sorts of crazy shades. The best part was running around with my cousins, chasing each other with pichkaris filled with colored water. We’d start pretty early, around 8:00 AM IST, and it would go on till, like, 4:00 PM IST.

{"unnormalised": "The thing about Holi is, it's not just about the colours. It's about coming together, forgetting all your differences, and just having a good time.
