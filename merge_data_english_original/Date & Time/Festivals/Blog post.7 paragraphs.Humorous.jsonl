As if my life is not already a chaotic jalebi. And then he said, \"Make sure it does not clash with any major holidays, Rakesh.\" Rakesh, he says, as if I possess the temporal mastery of a seasoned pandit. Dude, I can barely remember my anniversary, let alone every single festival celebrated in this gloriously, madly diverse country."}

One minute you are wrapping up Diwali on twelfth november two thousand and twenty three (wait, did I buy mithai?), the next you are already gearing up for Christmas on twenty fifth december two thousand and twenty three! How does anyone keep up? My Google Calendar looks like it threw up a rainbow onto a digital grid."}

Holi in Mathura is apparently a whole different beast than Holi in Kolkata. I mean, both involve color, but I suspect the Mathura version involves approximately three hundred percent more bhang. I saw a documentary about it once, around three A-M when I could not sleep. Never again."}

My Tamilian colleague, Priya, keeps inviting me, promising delicious food and cultural enlightenment. I keep politely declining because, let us be honest, I am picturing myself accidentally setting my kurta on fire while trying to cook pongal in a clay pot. My cooking skills peak at microwaving Maggi."}

Apparently, it happens annually on the second Saturday of August. Imagine trying to explain to my boss, \"Sorry, I cannot make the presentation because I am busy watching a bunch of blokes in boats racing alongside some very enthusiastic snakes.\" He would promote me to the permanent night shift, which starts at eleven P-M every night."}

Just when you think you have got a handle on it, B-A-M! Another festival pops up like a surprise exam you did not study for, and you realize it is a public holiday observed at state level."}

If I accidentally schedule a meeting during Eid, so be it. At least there will be delicious biryani. And if I miss Diwali, I will just buy a year's supply of firecrackers and set them off on first january two thousand and twenty five to compensate. Happy New Year, indeed!"}
