{"unnormalised": "Well, the Hindu calendar, also known as the Panchang, is a lunisolar calendar, meaning it's based on the movements of both the moon and the sun. This is why the dates of festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Navratri change every year in the Gregorian calendar we use daily. Understanding this interplay is key to appreciating the timing of our celebrations. Many festivals align with important agricultural cycles and seasonal changes, rooted deeply in ancient agrarian societies. For example, Makar Sankranti usually falls around 14/01 and marks the end of winter and the beginning of longer days.", "normalised": "Well, the Hindu calendar, also known as the Panchang, is a lunisolar calendar, meaning it's based on the movements of both the moon and the sun.

Ram Navami occurs on the 9th day of Shukla Paksha in the month of Chaitra, falling around March/April.", "normalised": "The Hindu calendar is divided into months that are determined by the phases of the moon.
