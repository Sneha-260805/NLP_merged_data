Seriously, *every other day* it feels like there's another public holiday. My boss, Mr. Sharma, nearly had a coronary when I asked for leave on 25/12!

What next, Bhai Dooj in July?\"", "normalised": "Okay, let me tell you, trying to keep track of Indian festivals is harder than trying to parallel park an auto-rickshaw in peak hour traffic on Linking Road.

Something about a demon king being defeated, maybe a harvest, or just an excuse for everyone to eat sweets for 3 days straight. My brain cells can't handle it.", "normalised": "And the sheer variety!

{"unnormalised": "And the amount of prep! Cleaning the entire house for Diwali is practically a national sport. It's like the Olympics of domestic chores. My wife starts planning 6 months in advance. “The paint, Rakesh, *must* be completed by 10/10 at the latest. And the mithai order… from Haldiram’s, of course!” And the shopping! Oh god, the shopping. Every festival is an excuse to buy a new saree, new electronics, new car... new everything! My credit card weeps quietly in the corner.", "normalised": "And the amount of prep!
