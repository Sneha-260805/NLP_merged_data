{"unnormalised": "The Indian festival calendar is a complex interplay of solar and lunar cycles, often dictated by the positions of celestial bodies. Many Hindu festivals, for instance, are based on the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which synchronizes lunar months with the solar year. This results in festival dates that vary from year to year in the Gregorian calendar. For example, Diwali, the festival of lights, typically falls between mid-October and mid-November, but its precise date depends on the position of the moon in the Hindu month of Kartika.", "normalised": "The Indian festival calendar is a complex interplay of solar and lunar cycles, often dictated by the positions of celestial bodies.

The timing of these festivals is not arbitrary; it is rooted in ancient astronomical observations and astrological beliefs. The precise moment when a festival begins is often determined by religious scholars and astrologers who consult traditional almanacs, known as Panchangs. These almanacs provide detailed information about auspicious times, planetary positions, and the alignment of stars, ensuring that rituals and celebrations are conducted at the most propitious moments.", "normalised": "Similarly, Holi, the festival of colors, is celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna, usually in March.

{"unnormalised": "The temporal significance of Indian festivals extends beyond the mere calculation of dates. Each festival is associated with a specific timeframe, during which certain rituals must be performed, prayers must be offered, and festivities must be enjoyed. For instance, Durga Puja, a major festival in eastern India, is celebrated over a period of ten days, culminating in the immersion of the Durga idol on the tenth day, known as Vijayadashami. The nine nights preceding Vijayadashami, known as Navaratri, are dedicated to the worship of the nine forms of the goddess Durga.", "normalised": "The temporal significance of Indian festivals extends beyond the mere calculation of dates.

{"unnormalised": "The timing of events within a festival is often meticulously planned. On Diwali, Lakshmi Puja, the worship of the goddess of wealth, is typically performed during the Amavasya (new moon) night. The exact time for the puja is considered highly auspicious, and families often consult priests to determine the most favorable moment. Similarly, the lighting of lamps and the exchange of sweets and gifts are all timed to coincide with specific moments of the day or night.", "normalised": "The timing of events within a festival is often meticulously planned.

{"unnormalised": "Moreover, time plays a crucial role in the preparation and anticipation leading up to a festival. Weeks, or even months, before a major festival, households begin to prepare. Houses are cleaned, new clothes are purchased, and special foods are prepared. This period of preparation is itself an integral part of the festival experience, heightening the sense of excitement and anticipation. For example, the preparations for Onam in Kerala typically begin 10 days before Thiruvonam, the most important day of the festival.", "normalised": "Moreover, time plays a crucial role in the preparation and anticipation leading up to a festival.

{"unnormalised": "Different communities and regions within India may celebrate the same festival on different dates or with variations in the rituals and customs. This diversity reflects the rich cultural heritage of India and the local adaptations of ancient traditions. The regional variations in festival timings are often due to differences in the local calendars or the interpretations of astrological calculations. For example, some communities may celebrate Ugadi, the Telugu and Kannada New Year, on a different date than Gudi Padwa, the Marathi New Year, even though both festivals mark the beginning of the spring season.", "normalised": "Different communities and regions within India may celebrate the same festival on different dates or with variations in the rituals and customs.
