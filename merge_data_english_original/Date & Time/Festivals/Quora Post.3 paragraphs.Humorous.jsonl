It's like trying to predict the monsoon – you have a rough idea, but the exact date is anyone's guess. Take Ganesh Chaturthi, for instance. One year it's like, \"Oh, it's on 31/08,\" and the next year, the panditji is like, \"Nahin, it's actually on 09/09 this time, because of some planetary alignment no one understands.\" Then your office is closed a different day each year, and you're trying to figure out if you can prepone your vacation by a day or two.

Dhanteras, Choti Diwali… figuring out which day is which according to the Vikram Samvat calendar is enough to give you a headache. My mom is consulting the astrological charts from 2024, 2025, 2026, it's a whole production. Then you have to factor in the different regional calendars, cause West Bengal has Kali Puja at the same time, and suddenly you're celebrating two different festivals at once.", "normalised": "And don't even get me started on Diwali!

Just prep yourself for the confusion and stock up on sweets and firecrackers early - like around 01/07 or so, just in case!
