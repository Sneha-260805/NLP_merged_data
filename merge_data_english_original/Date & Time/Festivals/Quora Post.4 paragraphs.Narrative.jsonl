{"unnormalised": "Then came the official announcement: Diwali on Oct 24th, 2022, and wedding festivities kicking off from the 22nd. Of course, tickets prices went through the roof! Trying to figure out the best time to arrive, balancing cost and convenience, was a real headache. Should I reach on the 21st night itself, just before the rituals begin? Or the 22nd morning and miss the initial ceremonies?

Lesson learned: Indian festivals and weddings require strategic planning involving lots of number crunching and a bit of luck regarding dates and times!
