{"unnormalised": "So, you want to know when Diwali is this year, huh? Good luck with that. It’s like trying to herd cats wearing sarees while juggling mithai. Predicting the date is a cosmic guessing game, folks. One wrong look at the lunar calendar and you'll be telling everyone to light their diyas on 14/Nov instead of 4/Nov and causing a national chaos. Trust me, your WhatsApp groups will never forgive you. My Auntie Sarla still brings up the great Diwali-fail of '08 at every family gathering. It involved fireworks, a rogue cow, and a very confused pandit.", "normalised": "So, you want to know when Diwali is this year, huh? Good luck with that.

{"unnormalised": "The problem isn't just remembering the date itself, which by the way, is tied to the Hindu lunar calendar – a system so complex it makes rocket science look like counting on your fingers (all ten of them, naturally). It's the relentless preponing. \"Diwali is fast approaching!\" they say, as early as August. Before you can say \"Happy Ganesh Chaturthi!\" your inbox is flooded with \"Diwali Dhamaka!\" offers. By 15/Sept, the pressure is on to book your train tickets home, even though the festival itself might be weeks away. Honestly, sometimes it feels like Diwali lasts from September 1st to December 31st!", "normalised": "The problem isn't just remembering the date itself, which by the way, is tied to the Hindu lunar calendar – a system so complex it makes rocket science look like counting on your fingers (all ten of them, naturally).

They’ll tell you if lighting a sparkler at exactly 7:17 PM on Diwali day will bring you wealth, health, and a promotion. If you light it at 7:18 PM, however, you’re doomed to a life of debt, disease, and having to listen to your neighbour’s bhajan music at 5:00 AM every morning.

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the debate about the actual day to celebrate. Dhanteras on 01/Nov, Choti Diwali on 03/Nov and Badi Diwali on 04/Nov - keep track of all these! It's a minefield. You've got your purists who follow every little ritual down to the last sesame seed and your modernists who just want to light a few anaars and call it a day. There's always *that* uncle who argues that Diwali should *always* be celebrated on the Amavasya tithi, regardless of what the printed calendar says.
