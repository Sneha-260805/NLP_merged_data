{"unnormalised": "The first hurdle often lies in deciphering the date formats. While the international standard is MM/DD/YYYY, in India, the DD/MM/YYYY format is commonly used. For example, 15/08/2024 signifies the 15th of August, 2024. However, it's essential to be aware that in some international contexts, this could be misinterpreted. Always double-check the context, especially when dealing with international events or collaborations. To minimize confusion, some organizers opt for a more explicit format such as 15th Aug 2024, particularly in digital communications.", "normalised": "The first hurdle often lies in deciphering the date formats.

{"unnormalised": "Time formats also present a unique set of considerations. The 12-hour format (e.g., 3:00 PM) is widely used in informal settings and media broadcasts, making it essential to understand the AM/PM designation. 3:00 PM refers to 3 o'clock in the afternoon, while 3:00 AM signifies 3 o'clock in the morning. The 24-hour format (e.g., 15:00) is less common in casual conversation but frequently appears in official schedules and digital platforms. A game listed as starting at 19:30, for instance, will commence at 7:30 PM.", "normalised": "Time formats also present a unique set of considerations.

{"unnormalised": "Time zones are equally important. India operates on a single time zone, Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. This means that a match scheduled for 10:00 AM IST will occur 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. If a schedule displays a time in another zone, such as EST (Eastern Standard Time) for a US-based event, converting it to IST is crucial. Online tools and converters can be invaluable in these scenarios. For instance, a game at 10:00 AM EST would be at 7:30 PM IST, taking daylight savings into account, if applicable.", "normalised": "Time zones are equally important.
