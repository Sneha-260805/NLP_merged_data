{"unnormalised": "So, the IPL is supposedly starting on 23/03/2025 and going all the way to, like, the end of May. That's almost 2 months of non-stop cricket, which is great, but also kinda exhausting to follow, right? Especially with all the double-headers. Imagine trying to keep up with two matches in one day! My wife will kill me if I spend every weekend glued to the TV from 2 PM to 11 PM.", "normalised": "So, the I-P-L is supposedly starting on twenty third March two thousand and twenty five and going all the way to, like, the end of May.
