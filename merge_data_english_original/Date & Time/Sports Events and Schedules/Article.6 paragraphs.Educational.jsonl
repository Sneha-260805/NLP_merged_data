{"unnormalised": "Firstly, the cornerstone of any sports schedule is the date and time. In India, you will often encounter dates presented in the DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 15/08/2024 for August 15th, 2024). However, variations are common. Some schedules might use the MM/DD/YYYY format, especially when dealing with international events. Other instances may abbreviate the month, such as \"15th Aug 2024\". Being mindful of these variations is vital. It's also essential to check if the year is included; an abbreviation of '24 may be confusing.", "normalised": "Firstly, the cornerstone of any sports schedule is the date and time. In India, you will often encounter dates presented in the D-D slash M-M slash Y-Y-Y-Y format (e.g., fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four for August fifteenth, two thousand and twenty four). However, variations are common. Some schedules might use the M-M slash D-D slash Y-Y-Y-Y format, especially when dealing with international events.

{"unnormalised": "Time is also a crucial element. In India, we operate on IST, which is GMT+5:30. Therefore, when an international sports event is listed with a different time zone (e.g., EST or PST), converting it to IST is necessary to avoid missing the start of the match. Schedules may list times in both 12-hour (e.g., 3:30 PM) and 24-hour (e.g., 15:30) formats. A good practice is to always double-check your conversion to ensure you have the right time for the match.", "normalised": "Time is also a crucial element. In India, we operate on I-S-T, which is G-M-T plus five hours thirty minutes. Therefore, when an international sports event is listed with a different time zone (e.g., E-S-T or P-S-T), converting it to I-S-T is necessary to avoid missing the start of the match. Schedules may list times in both twelve-hour (e.g., three thirty P-M) and twenty four-hour (e.g., fifteen thirty) formats. A good practice is to always double-check your conversion to ensure you have the right time for the match."}
{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, note that many schedules will use abbreviations for recurring events. For example, WC2026 would be \"World Cup 2026\", T20WC for \"T20 World Cup\", IPL2025 for \"Indian Premier League 2025\". These are not always consistent, hence it's good practice to verify. Tournament schedules are not set in stone, and a \"TBD\" or \"To Be Determined\" entry on the time and date may cause confusion.", "normalised": "Furthermore, note that many schedules will use abbreviations for recurring events.

These are not always consistent, hence it's good practice to verify. Tournament schedules are not set in stone, and a \"T-B-D\" or \"To Be Determined\" entry on the time and date may cause confusion."}
{"unnormalised": "Another challenging aspect is accounting for potential reschedulings or delays due to weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. Keep an eye on official websites, sports news outlets, and social media channels for any last-minute changes. Matches in Chennai during monsoon season, or Delhi during peak summer may be adjusted. The term 'preponed' might be used to denote that an event has been brought forward.", "normalised": "Another challenging aspect is accounting for potential reschedulings or delays due to weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances.
