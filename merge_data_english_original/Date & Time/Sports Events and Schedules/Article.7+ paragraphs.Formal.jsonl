{"unnormalised": "One major inconsistency lies in the date formats used across various media platforms. While some organizations prefer the DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 15/08/2024 for Independence Day Cricket Match), others opt for MM/DD/YYYY, especially when reporting events involving international teams. This discrepancy can easily lead to misinterpretations, particularly when dealing with dates that could be valid in both formats. Furthermore, abbreviated month names (e.g., 15th Aug 2024) are frequently employed, adding another layer of potential ambiguity. For instance, the Pro Kabaddi League final is provisionally scheduled for 28/12/24, however, the exact date and time are yet to be confirmed by the organizers.", "normalised": "One major inconsistency lies in the date formats used across various media platforms.

{"unnormalised": "Time formats present a similar challenge. While the 24-hour clock is gradually gaining acceptance, the 12-hour AM/PM system remains prevalent, especially in vernacular publications and digital platforms. The Indian Standard Time (IST) further complicates matters. While explicitly stated in some cases (e.g., 7:30 PM IST), it is often omitted, assuming the reader's inherent understanding. The IPL final is advertised to start at 8 PM, but there is no explicit mention that it is 8 PM IST. This can be troublesome for international audiences or viewers in other time zones.", "normalised": "Time formats present a similar challenge.
