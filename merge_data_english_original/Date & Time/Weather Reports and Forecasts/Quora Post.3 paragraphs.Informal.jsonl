See, IMD (India Meteorological Department) does its best, issuing forecasts like \"heavy rainfall expected in Mumbai on 15/07/2024\" but predicting the exact time and intensity is tough. Sometimes they get it spot-on, saying \"light showers 4 PM onwards\" and it happens, other times… well, let’s just say you end up carrying your umbrella for nothing, or getting drenched despite checking the forecast at 7:00 AM that morning!", "normalised": "So, someone asked about how accurate weather forecasts are in India, especially during the monsoon.

{"unnormalised": "The thing is, Indian weather is super complex. Things change quickly, especially during the monsoon, thanks to stuff like the Western Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. You might see a forecast saying \"partly cloudy with a chance of rain\" and think nothing of it, then suddenly, boom! A cloudburst hits around 2:30 PM. Also, things can vary wildly even within a city. Like, it might be pouring in Bandra while it's dry as a bone in Dadar. So, relying completely on a single forecast, even if it’s from a trusted source, isn’t always the best idea.", "normalised": "The thing is, Indian weather is super complex.
