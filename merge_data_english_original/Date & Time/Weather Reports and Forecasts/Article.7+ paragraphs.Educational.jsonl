{"unnormalised": "Dates in Indian weather reports are frequently presented in a variety of formats. One common format is the DD/MM/YYYY style. For example, a forecast might state \"Heavy rainfall expected on 23/07/2024 in Mumbai.\" Alternatively, the format DD-MM-YYYY may be used, as in \"Temperature to drop significantly by 24-07-2024.\" Another typical rendering is the abbreviated month format such as \"15th Aug 2024\" or \"5 Jan 2025\". The full month format is also possible, but less frequent, for instance: \"26th December, 2024\". It's vital to note that these formats can sometimes lead to ambiguity, especially when the day is less than 12, and the interpretation may vary. Some older reports could still use YY instead of YYYY.", "normalised": "dates in indian weather reports are frequently presented in a variety of formats. one common format is the D-D slash M-M slash Y-Y-Y-Y style. for example, a forecast might state \"heavy rainfall expected on twenty third july two thousand and twenty four in mumbai.\" alternatively, the format D-D dash M-M dash Y-Y-Y-Y may be used, as in \"temperature to drop significantly by twenty fourth july two thousand and twenty four.\" another typical rendering is the abbreviated month format such as \"fifteenth august two thousand and twenty four\" or \"fifth january two thousand and twenty five\". the full month format is also possible, but less frequent, for instance: \"twenty sixth december, two thousand and twenty four\". it's vital to note that these formats can sometimes lead to ambiguity, especially when the day is less than twelve, and the interpretation may vary. some older reports could still use Y-Y instead of Y-Y-Y-Y."}
{"unnormalised": "Time representation in weather reports uses both the 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The 12-hour format often includes AM or PM indicators: \"Rainfall expected at 3:00 PM IST.\" The 24-hour format, common in more formal or technical reports, eliminates this ambiguity: \"Maximum temperature recorded at 14:30 hours IST.\" The term \"IST,\" which stands for Indian Standard Time, is almost always included to specify the time zone. Sunrise and sunset times are often cited as well.
