I-M-D seems to be giving out different info than, say, Skymet Weather, and the local news channels are just adding to the confusion. Anyone else experiencing this? Specifically, the forecast for Mumbai on twenty sixth July two thousand and twenty four is showing everything from light showers to \"heavy to very heavy rainfall\" warnings. How am I supposed to plan my commute to office at nine zero zero A-M when the predictions are so varied?"}

Some are saying first June two thousand and twenty four, while others are pushing it back to seventh June two thousand and twenty four. This variation of plus minus six days makes a significant difference for agriculture and water management, especially in the Cauvery basin. It would be helpful if someone could shed some light on which sources have historically proven to be more reliable and consistent in their predictions. It would also be useful to have a resource which displays temperature in Celsius, as I see a lot of foreign sites are still reporting in Fahrenheit."}
