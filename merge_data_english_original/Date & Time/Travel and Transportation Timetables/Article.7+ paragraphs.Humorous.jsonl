It proudly declares the arrival of the 12345 Howrah Express at 06:00 AM sharp. In reality? More like 09:30 AM, give or take a few hours, depending on whether a cow is feeling particularly stubborn on the tracks near Mughalsarai. The 'on time' performance of Indian trains is a national mystery!", "normalised": "First, there's the \"official\" timetable.

{"unnormalised": "Then, you have the \"unofficial\" timetable, which is whispered amongst seasoned travelers. It’s based on folklore, weather patterns, and the general mood of the engine driver. This timetable is generally more accurate, especially if you bribe the chai-wallah on the platform with an extra biscuit; he seems to know everything. According to my cousin's mother-in-law, the 22222 Rajdhani Express to Mumbai is always 2 hours late on Tuesdays (unless there's a politician on board, in which case, it's only 1 hour late).", "normalised": "Then, you have the \"unofficial\" timetable, which is whispered amongst seasoned travelers.

{"unnormalised": "Don't even get me started on platform announcements. The announcer speaks at the speed of light, in a language that vaguely resembles Hindi, while battling against a background symphony of honking trains, squawking vendors, and crying babies. By the time you figure out that \"Train number 78901 is arriving on platform number… garbled sounds… six… maybe eight… good luck!\", your train has probably already left. Or, more likely, it's been diverted to a completely different station, like Surat instead of Ahmedabad.", "normalised": "Don't even get me started on platform announcements.

{"unnormalised": "However, the real gem lies in the departure delays. If the train is scheduled to depart at 14:15 hours from Delhi, the likelihood of it actually leaving at that time is inversely proportional to how important your meeting is. Got a crucial job interview? Expect a 4-hour delay. Just going to visit your relatives? Miraculously, the train will be on time, leaving you with nothing to complain about (except maybe the questionable hygiene of the toilets).", "normalised": "However, the real gem lies in the departure delays.

Because with Indian Railways, it’s not just about reaching your destination; it’s about the hilarious, unpredictable journey along the way. After all, who needs a boring, punctual train when you can have a story to tell? Arriving late is practically a part of the travel experience!", "normalised": "So, the next time you book a train in India, remember to pack your patience, a good book, and maybe a small camping stove.
