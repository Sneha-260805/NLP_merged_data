{"unnormalised": "First off, let's consider train schedules. If you're planning a train journey from, say, Delhi to Kolkata, you might see a train listed to depart at 14:30 hrs. That's 2:30 PM in regular speak, but it's important to get used to the 24-hour format on railway websites and apps. It can be confusing initially, but you'll get the hang of it.

{"unnormalised": "Then there are flight timetables. Airlines usually stick to local time, but when you’re booking an international flight, keep the time difference in mind. For instance, a flight leaving Mumbai at 02:00 hours to Dubai means you’ll be landing at a different time zone – maybe around 04:00 hours UAE time, depending on daylight saving. Airlines usually clearly state the local arrival time but double-checking never hurts. And remember to prepone any important meetings accordingly!", "normalised": "Then there are flight timetables.

{"unnormalised": "Local transport like metros and auto-rickshaws have their own rhythm.
