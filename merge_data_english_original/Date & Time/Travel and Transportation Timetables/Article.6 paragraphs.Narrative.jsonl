Would it be truly fast, or just relatively less slow than the ‘Slow’ trains? The board also listed 7:18 AM as another Dadar departure. The platform assignments, changing every few minutes, only added to the confusion. It felt like decoding ancient hieroglyphics, not planning a simple commute.", "normalised": "The timetable promised a train to Dadar at seven fifteen A-M. ‘Dadar Fast’ it proclaimed.

Check the timings carefully. And always pre-pone your arrival by 10 minutes. Trains here run sharp, usually.\" He was right; the trains mostly adhered to the displayed times, give or take a few minutes during peak hours.

I learned the significance of each color-coded line on the printed charts, each indicating a different route and frequency. I discovered that the first train often departed from CSMT at 4:00 AM, with services running almost continuously until 1:00 AM the next day. The frequency increased dramatically between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM, during the morning rush, and again between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, when everyone was heading home.", "normalised": "Over time, I mastered the art of deciphering the timetable.
