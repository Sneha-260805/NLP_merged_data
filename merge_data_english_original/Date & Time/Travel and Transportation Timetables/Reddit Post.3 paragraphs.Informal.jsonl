I'm seeing the Mandovi Express leaves CSMT at 7:10 AM and arrives in Madgaon at 7:30 PM the same day, but that's like a whole day gone! Is there anything faster? Maybe a night train? Also, gotta factor in the date. We're planning for around 20/12/2024.", "normalised": "Okay guys, need some help planning this Mumbai to Goa trip.

Plus, no worries about train delays which are always a thing, right? Anyone got recent experience with flight delays around that time of year, like late December? I'm thinking of booking tix like, asap so I'd need to decide on something soon.", "normalised": "Alternatively, I saw some flights on MakeMyTrip – Indigo showing a direct flight leaving B-O-M at fourteen forty five hours and landing in G-O-I around sixteen zero zero hours.

I'm seeing some Volvo services from MSRTC leaving Mumbai at 17:00 hrs and arriving in Panjim around 06:00 hrs the next morning. Cheap, yeah, but are they comfy enough for an overnight journey? Also, need to book way in advance for those during peak season, I'm assuming? Give me your recommendations and/or horror stories!", "normalised": "Finally, what about buses?
