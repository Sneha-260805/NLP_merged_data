{"unnormalised": "Has anyone taken the Taj Express recently? I’m looking at catching the 12279 train. Its scheduled departure is at 6:55 AM from NDLS and arrival at Agra Cantt is 9:40 AM, if it’s on time of course lol. Is that a good option, or are there better trains or even buses that folks recommend? I’m open to leaving Delhi late on 10/27/24 if there are overnight travel options. Also, I'm seeing buses that leave ISBT at like 11:00 PM, reaching Agra around 4:00 AM. Is that too early, and will I be stranded until the Taj opens at sunrise?", "normalised": "Has anyone taken the Taj Express recently? I am looking at catching the one two two seven nine train.

{"unnormalised": "Basically, I'm looking for the most convenient option – not necessarily the cheapest! Any advice on timings, train numbers, bus operators or anything else would be hugely appreciated! I'm traveling solo, so safety's also a small concern. Planning to book whatever option I finalize by 10/20/24 to ensure availability. Thanks in advance for the help!", "normalised": "Basically, I am looking for the most convenient option – not necessarily the cheapest!
