{"unnormalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the best time to travel from Delhi to Agra by train. Honestly, it depends on what you're looking for! The Taj Mahal is open pretty much year-round, but weather-wise, Oct to March is usually best. Think pleasant days, not too hot or cold. So if you're planning a trip around then, you've got tons of train options.", "normalised": "Okay, so someone asked about the best time to travel from Delhi to Agra by train.

{"unnormalised": "For example, the Taj Express (12279) leaves Delhi around 13:15 hrs and gets to Agra by 16:00 hrs. Super convenient for a day trip! Or, there's the Gatimaan Express (12050) - it's faster, leaving around 08:10 AM and reaching Agra in about 1 hr 40 mins. Downside? It's usually pricier. Check IRCTC for the latest timings and fares, as they can change slightly. Just remember peak season (like Diwali time) means booked-out trains and higher prices, so book in advance!", "normalised": "For example, the Taj Express (one two two seven nine) leaves Delhi around one three fifteen hours and gets to Agra by sixteen zero zero hours.
