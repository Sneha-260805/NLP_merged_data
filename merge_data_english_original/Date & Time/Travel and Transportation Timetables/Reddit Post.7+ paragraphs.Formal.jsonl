{"unnormalised": "Furthermore, when booking flights, I've noticed that arrival and departure times are often expressed in local time. However, given India's vastness, I'm unsure how to consistently account for time zone differences. For example, a flight departing Guwahati at 06:00 IST (Indian Standard Time) and arriving in Mumbai at 08:30 IST seems straightforward, but what if the flight details don't explicitly mention IST?
