You might see something like \"Train 12649 departs SBC at 13:30 hrs.\" This means the train leaves Bangalore City Junction (SBC) at 1:30 PM, but presented in 24-hour format. Always double-check if it says \"hrs\" or \"AM/PM\" to avoid missing your train! Also, some websites might just show \"1330\" without the colon, which still means 1:30 PM.", "normalised": "First off, pay super close attention to the format.

Keep an eye out for possible delays; often you'll see something like \"Expected arrival at 16:30 (Delayed by 30 mins).\" That means your 4 PM arrival is now pushed to 4:30 PM.

{"unnormalised": "Something else to watch out for is the days of operation. The timetable might say \"Operates on: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun\" – meaning it runs every day. But, if it says \"Operates on: Mon, Wed, Fri,\" it only runs on those specific days. Don't assume a train runs daily without checking! Many trains have odd schedules. For example, I saw train 22682 schedule that operated Tue, Thu and Sun only.", "normalised": "Something else to watch out for is the days of operation.

If a train departs on 23/07 at 23:00 (11 PM) and arrives on 24/07 at 06:00 (6 AM), make sure you’re booking for the right date!

{"unnormalised": "Finally, remember that train number is critical. A train number like 12007 is unique. Always double-check the train number AND the train name (like Shatabdi Express).
