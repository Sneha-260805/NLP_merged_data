{"unnormalised": "One of the key elements is the date and time format. While digital displays increasingly use the 24-hour clock (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM), older formats may still use the 12-hour clock followed by AM or PM. For instance, \"6:00 AM\" denotes 6 in the morning, and \"10:00 PM\" refers to 10 at night. Keep an eye out for these indicators to avoid confusion. Arrival and departure times are often listed together, sometimes separated by a slash (e.g., 06:00/18:00 – meaning arrival at 6 AM, departure at 6 PM on a connecting journey). Dates will often appear as DD/MM/YYYY, so 01/01/2024 would be January 1st, 2024.", "normalised": "One of the key elements is the date and time format. While digital displays increasingly use the twenty four hour clock (e.g., fourteen thirty for two thirty P M), older formats may still use the twelve hour clock followed by A M or P M. For instance, \"six A M\" denotes six in the morning, and \"ten P M\" refers to ten at night. Keep an eye out for these indicators to avoid confusion. Arrival and departure times are often listed together, sometimes separated by a slash (e.g., zero six zero zero slash eighteen zero zero – meaning arrival at six A M, departure at six P M on a connecting journey). Dates will often appear as D D slash M M slash Y Y Y Y, so first January two thousand and twenty four would be January first, two thousand and twenty four."}
{"unnormalised": "Train timetables typically display the train number, name, and route. Departure and arrival times are specified for each station along the route. For example, \"Train No. 12001, Bhopal Shatabdi, Delhi to Bhopal, Dep: 06:00 from NDLS (New Delhi Station), Arr: 14:30 at BPL (Bhopal Junction).\" Sometimes, days of operation are indicated with abbreviations: MTWTFSS (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday). An 'X' usually means the train does *not* run on that day. So, MTWTF-S means it runs Monday-Friday and Sunday.", "normalised": "Train timetables typically display the train number, name, and route.

{"unnormalised": "Bus timetables can be more variable, especially for state-run services. They often list origin and destination points, along with departure frequencies. A timetable might say, \"Delhi to Jaipur, every 2 hours from 05:00 to 23:00.\" Private bus operators might provide more detailed schedules online, including specific departure times (e.g., \"07:15\", \"10:30\", \"14:45\"). Be aware that these times are subject to change based on traffic and other unforeseen delays. Look out for abbreviations of origin and destination, e.g. \"Blore\" for Bangalore and \"Hyd\" for Hyderabad.", "normalised": "Bus timetables can be more variable, especially for state hyphen run services.

{"unnormalised": "Flight timetables are usually the easiest to interpret, using standardized abbreviations for airports (e.g., DEL for Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, BOM for Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). They list flight numbers, departure and arrival times (often in the 24-hour format), and the days of operation. A flight might be listed as \"AI 101, DEL-BOM, 08:00-10:00, Daily\". Note that flight schedules are frequently updated, so always confirm the timings with the airline close to your departure date. Keep an eye out for '+1' notations, indicating arrival on the following day.", "normalised": "Flight timetables are usually the easiest to interpret, using standardized abbreviations for airports (e.g., D-E-L for Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, B-O-M for Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport).

Timetables displayed at stations or online may not always be up-to-date, especially due to last-minute changes or disruptions. Cross-referencing information from multiple sources, such as the Indian Railways website (for trains) or the respective state transport corporation websites (for buses), will help you plan your journey with greater accuracy.
