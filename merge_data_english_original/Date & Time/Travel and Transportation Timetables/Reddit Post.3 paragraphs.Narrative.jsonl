The HRTC website says the bus leaves at 8:30 PM from ISBT Kashmiri Gate, but my friend told me they sometimes prepone it to 8:00 PM. Has anyone taken this recently?

{"unnormalised": "Also, I was looking at the train options, but the timing is kinda wonky. The fastest one seems to be the Himachal Express, but it leaves Delhi at 10:45 PM and gets to Pathankot at like 7:00 AM the next day. Then you gotta take a taxi or bus from Pathankot, which adds another 3-4 hrs. Is there a better option I’m missing? Someone mentioned a direct bus from Pathankot that leaves at 7:30 AM, but I can’t find confirmation anywhere.", "normalised": "Also, I was looking at the train options, but the timing is kind of wonky.

{"unnormalised": "Lastly, I'm open to flying to Gaggal Airport, but the flights are expensive! Plus, the flight time is only 1 hr 15 mins but by the time I get to IGI airport 2 hrs before the flight (10:00 AM for an 12:00 PM flight), go through security, and then travel from Gaggal to McLeod Ganj, it seems like a massive waste of time + money. Any recommendations for the most convenient option, considering both time and cost? Really appreciate any insights!", "normalised": "Lastly, I am open to flying to Gaggal Airport, but the flights are expensive!
