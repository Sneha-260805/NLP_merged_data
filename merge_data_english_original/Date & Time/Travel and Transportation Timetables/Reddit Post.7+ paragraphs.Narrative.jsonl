{"unnormalised": "Finally, the train arrived at 3:00 AM. FIVE HOURS LATE! The coach was already a mess, clearly it had started its journey very late and others had already made a mess. I somehow managed to find my seat, which, surprise surprise, was occupied by some uncle-ji. Had to argue with him for like 15 mins before he finally budged. I was beyond exhausted. Barely slept a wink on the train as it was bumpy as anything! The ETA kept changing, and we finally rolled into Lucknow at 1:00 PM.

{"unnormalised": "The worst part? My family had been waiting at the station since 6:00 AM, thinking I'd arrive on time. Their Diwali prep got completely messed up. I reached home, feeling like a zombie. All I did was shower, eat and crash out for 6 solid hours. Lessons learnt: Always carry a power bank, and maybe just maybe, consider driving next time, even if its a 560 km drive! Still had a good Diwali eventually, but the train experience definitely took the festive cheer down a few notches. Anyone else had similar experiences?
