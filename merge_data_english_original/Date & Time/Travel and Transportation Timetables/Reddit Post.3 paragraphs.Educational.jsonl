{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, planning a trip on the Konkan Railway and a bit confused about the timings. Can someone help me decipher this timetable? It says the train leaves Mumbai CST at 05:50 hrs and reaches Madgaon at 14:30 hrs. Does that mean it's a 9 hour journey, roughly? Also, I'm seeing different arrival times for the same train on various websites - one says 2:30 PM and another says 14:45 hrs. Which one is correct, or how much buffer time should I keep?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, planning a trip on the Konkan Railway and a bit confused about the timings.

{"unnormalised": "Figuring out Indian train timetables can be tricky, especially with the 24-hour format and potential discrepancies. The timetable time 05:50 hrs indeed refers to 5:50 AM. And 14:30 hrs is 2:30 PM. The difference gives you total travel time. Now, the slight difference in arrival times across different websites (2:30 PM vs. 14:45 hrs) could be due to a few factors. It might be down to recent changes in the schedule by Indian Railways or sometimes just rounding differences in display. Check the official IRCTC website or app for the most up-to-date information. I personally would always add a buffer of around 15-30 minutes to the scheduled arrival time in case of unforeseen delays.", "normalised": "Figuring out Indian train timetables can be tricky, especially with the twenty four hour format and potential discrepancies.
