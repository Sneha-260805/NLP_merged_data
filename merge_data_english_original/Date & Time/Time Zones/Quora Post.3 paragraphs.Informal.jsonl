Like, I’m in Kolkata (IST), and my cousin’s studying in the US (EST). He always forgets the time difference. He’ll call me at 11:00 PM EST thinking it’s a reasonable time. It’s like, dude, it's 8:30 AM here! Prepone or postpone, doesn't matter, someone's always gonna be sleepy.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about time zones, so here is my take!
