{"unnormalised": "Unlike some countries that span multiple time zones, India has historically adopted a single time zone for ease of administration and economic cohesion. However, this decision has not been without its critics. The northeastern states, for instance, experience sunrise much earlier than the rest of the country. This discrepancy has led to calls for a separate time zone in the region, often referred to as the \"Tea Garden Time,\" to better align with local daylight hours. Discussions surrounding a potential IST-1, tentatively UTC+6:30, are ongoing.", "normalised": "Unlike some countries that span multiple time zones, India has historically adopted a single time zone for ease of administration and economic cohesion.

{"unnormalised": "The implications of a single time zone are varied. For businesses operating across the country, it simplifies scheduling and communication. Meetings scheduled for 11:00 AM IST are understood nationwide, regardless of the local sunrise time. However, the lack of regional time differentiation can impact productivity and energy consumption, particularly in the east. Early morning sunlight in states like Arunachal Pradesh is often wasted due to official work hours commencing later.", "normalised": "The implications of a single time zone are varied.

{"unnormalised": "The maintenance of IST is crucial for coordinating various aspects of Indian life. From railway schedules, like the Howrah Rajdhani Express departing at 17:00 IST, to broadcasting news bulletins and coordinating stock market trading, IST provides a vital reference point. Accurate timekeeping is maintained through the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Delhi, ensuring synchronization across the country. Even simple tasks, like setting your watch to 14:30 IST, are reliant on this centralized system.", "normalised": "The maintenance of I-S-T is crucial for coordinating various aspects of Indian life.

{"unnormalised": "The challenges of adhering to a single time zone are further compounded by India's complex relationship with Daylight Saving Time (DST). DST, commonly used in Western countries to maximize daylight hours during summer, has never been implemented nationally in India. Experiments with DST in the past have yielded mixed results, with concerns about its impact on agricultural practices and energy consumption. Currently, local or regional adjustments are sometimes observed; however, IST, or UTC+5:30, remains the governing time.", "normalised": "The challenges of adhering to a single time zone are further compounded by India's complex relationship with Daylight Saving Time (D-S-T).
