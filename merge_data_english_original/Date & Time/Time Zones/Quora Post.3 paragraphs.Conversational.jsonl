{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me what time it is in India right now, when it's 10 AM EST. So, India follows IST, which is Indian Standard Time, and it's GMT+5:30. That means it's 5 and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. Now, EST is Eastern Standard Time, and that's usually GMT-5, but during daylight saving, it's GMT-4. So figuring out the difference needs a little calculation, ya know?", "normalised": "Someone asked me what time it is in India right now, when it's ten A-M E-S-T.

{"unnormalised": "Let's assume no daylight savings, just to make it easier. If it's 10:00 AM EST (GMT-5), then GMT is 3:00 PM. Since India is GMT+5:30, just add that difference. So, 3:00 PM + 5 hours 30 mins comes to 8:30 PM IST. Keep in mind during Mar to Nov, the difference can get tricky because of daylight savings. Always double check, bhai!", "normalised": "Let's assume no daylight savings, just to make it easier. If it's ten A-M E-S-T (G-M-T minus five), then G-M-T is three P-M. Since India is G-M-T plus five thirty, just add that difference. So, three P-M plus five hours thirty minutes comes to eight thirty P-M I-S-T. Keep in mind during March to November, the difference can get tricky because of daylight savings. Always double check, bhai!"}
{"unnormalised": "So, long story short, if it's 10 AM EST right now and daylight savings isn't in effect, it's probably 8:30 PM in India. But always a good idea to quickly Google 'time in India' just to be 100% sure, especially between Mar-Nov! I hope this helped clarify things a bit!", "normalised": "So, long story short, if it's ten A-M E-S-T right now and daylight savings isn't in effect, it's probably eight thirty P-M in India.
