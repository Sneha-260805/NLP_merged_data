{"unnormalised": "Several countries observe DST during the summer months by advancing their clocks by one hour, typically between March and November. This practice aims to maximize daylight hours and reduce energy consumption. However, experts argue that the benefits of DST are minimal in India, given its proximity to the equator and the relatively small variation in daylight hours throughout the year.", "normalised": "Several countries observe D-S-T during the summer months by advancing their clocks by one hour, typically between March and November.

This decision reflects a careful consideration of various factors, including geographical location, energy consumption, economic impact, and public health. The global community may explore different approaches to time management, but India will maintain its commitment to IST, which has served the nation effectively for decades.", "normalised": "Therefore, India will continue to operate on I-S-T, ensuring consistency and stability in its timekeeping practices.
