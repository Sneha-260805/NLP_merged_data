{"unnormalised": "First off, India follows Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. So, always remember that base number. Now, figuring out the difference with Eastern Standard Time (EST) gets a little trickier. EST is GMT-5. That means there’s a 10.5 hr difference, but IST is always ahead. For example, 9:00 AM EST would be 7:30 PM IST. Keep that in mind, and don’t forget that this can change with Daylight Saving Time.", "normalised": "First off, India follows Indian Standard Time (I-S-T), which is G-M-T plus five hours and thirty minutes. So, always remember that base number. Now, figuring out the difference with Eastern Standard Time (E-S-T) gets a little trickier. E-S-T is G-M-T minus five. That means there’s a ten and a half hour difference, but I-S-T is always ahead. For example, nine o'clock A-M E-S-T would be seven thirty P-M I-S-T. Keep that in mind, and don’t forget that this can change with Daylight Saving Time."}
{"unnormalised": "Pacific Standard Time (PST) is GMT-8. This means the difference between PST and IST is 13.5 hours. Again, IST is ahead. So, if it's 10:00 AM PST, it's already 11:30 PM IST the next day! Remember to check the date too! Someone mentioned a meeting scheduled for 11:00 PM PST; that would be 12:30 PM IST the following day, a little early for chai and pakoras, maybe.", "normalised": "Pacific Standard Time (P-S-T) is G-M-T minus eight. This means the difference between P-S-T and I-S-T is thirteen and a half hours. Again, I-S-T is ahead. So, if it's ten o'clock A-M P-S-T, it's already eleven thirty P-M I-S-T the next day! Remember to check the date too! Someone mentioned a meeting scheduled for eleven o'clock P-M P-S-T; that would be twelve thirty P-M I-S-T the following day, a little early for chai and pakoras, maybe."}
