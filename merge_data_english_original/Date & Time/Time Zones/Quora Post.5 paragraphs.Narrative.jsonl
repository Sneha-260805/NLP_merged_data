{"unnormalised": "For most of India, we use IST (Indian Standard Time), which is GMT+5:30. That means we're always 5 and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. Simple enough, right?

{"unnormalised": "But here's the thing that gets confusing: places like Arunachal Pradesh used to unofficially follow a slightly different schedule, back in the day. People would sometimes advance their clocks by an hour or so, creating this weird local time thing. It never became official but it caused so much confusion! Now, things are pretty much standardized across the country. And because India is so wide, especially East to West, that difference between sunrise times can be almost 2 hrs!", "normalised": "But here's the thing that gets confusing: places like Arunachal Pradesh used to unofficially follow a slightly different schedule, back in the day.

{"unnormalised": "The problem really comes in when you’re scheduling calls with people in the US or Australia. If someone says they'll call at 7:00 PM EST, that's like, 5:30 AM IST the next day! I've had to set multiple alarms just to catch those calls. Even dealing with places like Dubai, which is GMT+4, means figuring out a 1.5 hour difference, which is easier to remember than the half hour differences.", "normalised": "The problem really comes in when you’re scheduling calls with people in the U-S or Australia.

{"unnormalised": "So, the easiest thing to do is use a time zone converter app. There are tons of them. Just type in the time and the time zone you want to convert from, and it'll tell you what time it is in IST. Learned this the hard way after one too many missed Zoom meetings at 3:30 AM. Hope this helps!", "normalised": "So, the easiest thing to do is use a time zone converter app. There are tons of them.
