{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about time zones in India and how they work, so figured I’d give a quick explanation. It’s actually simpler than you might think! India officially follows Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. This means we're always 5 and a half hrs ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. So, if it’s 12:00 PM in London, it’s 5:30 PM in Delhi. Easy peasy!", "normalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked about time zones in India and how they work, so figured I'd give a quick explanation. It's actually simpler than you might think!

{"unnormalised": "Now, you might wonder, why only one time zone for such a big country? Well, India spans quite a large longitude, and some folks, especially in the North East like Guwahati or Arunachal Pradesh, actually feel that sunrise comes really early. There have been discussions about having a separate time zone for the NE states (+6:30 maybe?), but nothing's been implemented yet. It's mainly a logistical thing, impacting train schedules and communications nationwide.", "normalised": "Now, you might wonder, why only one time zone for such a big country?

{"unnormalised": "It's interesting to note that during the British Raj, India actually had 2 time zones! There was Bombay Time (GMT+4:51) and Calcutta Time (GMT+5:53:20) in addition to the IST. Imagine the confusion trying to schedule calls across those regions! Glad we've simplified things since then.", "normalised": "It's interesting to note that during the British Raj, India actually had two time zones!

{"unnormalised": "So, to recap: India uses IST, which is GMT+5:30. While there's been talk about adding a second time zone, for now, we’re all on the same clock. Hope that clarifies things!
