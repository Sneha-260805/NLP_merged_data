This means if it's 12:00 PM in London (GMT), it's 5:30 PM in India. Pretty straightforward, right? However, there are some interesting aspects to consider. For instance, Arunachal Pradesh, being the easternmost state, sees sunrise almost 2 hours before Gujarat, but the entire country operates on the same IST. There was talk of implementing a separate time zone for the northeast to improve efficiency, but that's still under debate.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about time differences in India.

From March to November, they observe EDT, which is GMT-4. So, the time difference can vary. For example, in July, when New York is on EDT, a 10:00 AM meeting in New York would be 7:30 PM IST.

So, if you're coordinating with colleagues across South Asia, you'll need to factor in those differences too. Using a time zone converter is your best bet to avoid any confusion.
