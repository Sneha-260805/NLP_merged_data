{"unnormalised": "Many countries observe Daylight Saving Time (DST), adjusting their clocks forward by 1 hour during the summer months. For example, if a country observes DST and its standard time is GMT+1, during DST it becomes GMT+2. India, however, does not observe DST. This means the time difference between India and countries that do observe DST varies throughout the year. For instance, the time difference between Delhi and London may be 4:30 hrs at one point of the year and 5:30 hrs at another.", "normalised": "many countries observe daylight saving time (D-S-T), adjusting their clocks forward by one hour during the summer months. for example, if a country observes D-S-T and its standard time is G-M-T plus one, during D-S-T it becomes G-M-T plus two. india, however, does not observe D-S-T. this means the time difference between india and countries that do observe D-S-T varies throughout the year. for instance, the time difference between delhi and london may be four hours and thirty minutes at one point of the year and five hours and thirty minutes at another."}
{"unnormalised": "Calculating time differences requires careful consideration of both standard time and DST. Suppose a meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM EST (Eastern Standard Time, GMT-5). To convert this to IST, you would first add 5 hours to get to GMT (8:00 PM) and then add 5:30 hours to get to IST, resulting in 1:30 AM the next day.
