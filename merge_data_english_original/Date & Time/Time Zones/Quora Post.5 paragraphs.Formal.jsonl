{"unnormalised": "Question: How does India handle time differences with other countries?", "normalised": "India follows a single time zone, known as Indian Standard Time (I-S-T), which is U-T-C plus five hours and thirty minutes. This means that India is five hours and thirty minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (U-T-C). This standardized time was adopted on the first january nineteen o six, to provide uniformity across the country and to avoid confusion caused by regional time variations. This ensures that government offices, businesses, and transportation systems operate on a consistent schedule. The decision to adhere to a single time zone has both benefits and drawbacks."}
{"unnormalised": "India follows a single time zone, known as Indian Standard Time (IST), which is UTC+5:30. This means that India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This standardized time was adopted on 01/01/1906, to provide uniformity across the country and to avoid confusion caused by regional time variations. This ensures that government offices, businesses, and transportation systems operate on a consistent schedule. The decision to adhere to a single time zone has both benefits and drawbacks.", "normalised": "The primary advantage of having one time zone is the simplification of scheduling and coordination. For instance, railway timetables, airline schedules, and national television broadcasts are all synchronized to I-S-T. This eliminates the need for time zone conversions when communicating or conducting business across different states within India. Furthermore, having a single time zone streamlines financial markets, allowing for more efficient trading and investment activities. Phone calls scheduled for three zero zero P-M can be easily coordinated across the country."}

These states experience sunrise much earlier than the rest of the country, leading to reduced productivity during the later hours of the day. Proposals have been made to implement a separate time zone for the northeast, but these suggestions have not been implemented due to concerns about potential logistical and administrative complications. The sunset time in Guwahati on fifteenth july is significantly different than that of Mumbai."}

Many larger countries, such as the U-S-A, Canada, and Russia, span multiple time zones to accommodate the varying sunrise and sunset times across their vast territories. For example, the U-S has six time zones. In contrast, China, which is geographically similar in size to the U-S, also uses a single time zone, Beijing Standard Time (U-T-C plus eight), for political and national unity reasons."}

While alternative approaches have been considered, the existing system remains in place for the foreseeable future, supported by the need for national uniformity and streamlined operations across various sectors. D-S-T is not practiced in India, hence there is no change in time during summers."}
