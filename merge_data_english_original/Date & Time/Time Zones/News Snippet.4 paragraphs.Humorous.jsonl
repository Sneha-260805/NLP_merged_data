Time zones, those pesky invisible lines that dictate when we can (or can't) schedule that all-important Zoom call. One particularly amusing incident involved Priya Sharma in Mumbai trying to prepone a meeting with a client in New York, only to realize that \"prepone\" doesn't actually make sense when the client is literally sleeping. The meeting, initially planned for 4 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), got rescheduled for 2 AM EST (Eastern Standard Time). Priya wisely opted for email instead.", "normalised": "Reports are flooding in from companies across India as employees struggle to coordinate with their international counterparts. The culprit?

One tweet read, \"Is it 11 AM or 12 PM? My brain hurts. Thanks, DST!\" Clearly, the struggle is real. Experts are suggesting a global summit to discuss the possibility of a standardized time zone.

So, if your boss is suddenly late for a meeting, don’t blame him—blame Mercury in retrograde (and those darn time zones!). Maybe we should all just move to a desert island that doesn't have time zones. Wait, does such a place even exist?", "normalised": "In related news, astrologers are reporting a surge in consultations.
