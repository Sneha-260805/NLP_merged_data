{"unnormalised": "So I was just wondering, why is figuring out time differences between India and the US so confusing sometimes? Like, my cousin in New York is always telling me \"I'll call you at 9 AM,\" but then I have to do mental math to figure out what time that is for me here in Mumbai. It's never a straightforward thing! I know India uses IST, and the US has like a million time zones, but is there an easy way to keep track?", "normalised": "So I was just wondering, why is figuring out time differences between India and the U-S so confusing sometimes?

{"unnormalised": "I think the main issue is that the US has multiple time zones (EST, CST, PST, etc.) and Daylight Saving Time, which India doesn't. So depending on the time of year and which part of the US you're talking about, the difference can vary. For instance, EST is normally 9.5 hours behind IST, but during Daylight Saving Time, it becomes only 8.5 hours behind. That half-hour difference always throws me off! I saw an article which said DST starts on 03/10/2024, maybe that's why I'm so confused.", "normalised": "I think the main issue is that the U-S has multiple time zones (E-S-T, C-S-T, P-S-T, et cetera) and Daylight Saving Time, which India does not.

{"unnormalised": "A simple trick I’ve found useful is to remember the base difference for EST (9.5 hours) and then adjust accordingly for other time zones. So, if it's 12 PM in New York (EST), it's usually 9:30 PM in India. For PST, which is 3 hours behind EST, add those 3 hours to the Indian time. Just remember to double-check if DST is in effect, as it shifts everything by an hour! I also downloaded an app that automatically converts time zones - very helpful.", "normalised": "A simple trick I have found useful is to remember the base difference for E-S-T (nine point five hours) and then adjust accordingly for other time zones.
