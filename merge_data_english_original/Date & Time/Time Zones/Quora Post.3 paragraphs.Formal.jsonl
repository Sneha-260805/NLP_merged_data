{"unnormalised": "Someone asked me about converting times across different time zones in India. It’s a pretty common question given how many Indians have relatives or work with people abroad. So, converting 10:00 AM IST to, say, PST requires a little bit of calculation, as India follows Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. Therefore, you need to account for the difference between IST and the specific time zone you're targeting. For example, if you want to convert 2 PM IST to EST you must factor in the hours between GMT and EST.", "normalised": "Someone asked me about converting times across different time zones in India. It's a pretty common question given how many Indians have relatives or work with people abroad. So, converting ten A-M I-S-T to, say, P-S-T requires a little bit of calculation, as India follows Indian Standard Time (I-S-T), which is G-M-T plus five hours and thirty minutes. Therefore, you need to account for the difference between I-S-T and the specific time zone you're targeting.

{"unnormalised": "Converting 7 PM PST to IST involves adding the offset. California is GMT -8 so there is a 13.5 hour time difference. Remember that Daylight Savings Time (DST) can also affect conversions during certain parts of the year in countries like the USA. To accurately convert DST you must know the dates that it goes into affect and comes out of affect and their corresponding times. Usually DST is observed in the months of March to November. It is very important to have the specific details when conducting your conversion.", "normalised": "Converting seven P-M P-S-T to I-S-T involves adding the offset.

Just input the original time, time zone, and the target time zone, and the tool will display the converted time. Tools like World Time Buddy and Time and Date are very helpful to see time comparisons at a glance.
