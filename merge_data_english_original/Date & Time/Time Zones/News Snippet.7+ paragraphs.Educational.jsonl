{"unnormalised": "During daylight saving time (DST), some countries shift their clocks forward by an hour during the summer months, which can further complicate time zone calculations. India does not observe DST, so the difference between IST and other time zones remains constant throughout the year. For example, during DST, the time difference between New York (EDT) and India remains at 9 hours and 30 mins. So, 2 PM EDT in New York is still 11:30 PM IST.", "normalised": "During daylight saving time (D-S-T), some countries shift their clocks forward by an hour during the summer months, which can further complicate time zone calculations.

Cricket matches, for example, which are popular across the country, are often broadcasted at different times throughout the day.
