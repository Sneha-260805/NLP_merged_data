{"unnormalised": "What's the deal with time differences when travelling across India? Why does it feel like my body clock is messed up even though there's only one time zone?", "normalised": "Well, even though India officially has a single time zone, Indian Standard Time, which is G-M-T plus five hours and thirty minutes, travelling from, say, Guwahati in the East to Dwarka in the West can still throw your internal clock for a loop. This is because of the sheer geographical expanse – nearly three thousand kilometer! Think of it like this: sunrise in Guwahati is almost two hours earlier than in Dwarka. So, if you are used to waking up with the sun in Guwahati at, let us say, five zero zero A-M, and then suddenly find yourself in Dwarka where the sun rises closer to seven zero zero A-M, your body will definitely notice the difference."}

Imagine the advantages! The sun rises really early in Arunachal Pradesh, around four thirty A-M in some areas, which leads to significant daylight wastage. Adjusting the clocks even by an hour can make a big difference."}

The biggest concern is the potential for confusion and logistical problems, especially regarding transportation, communication, and business operations. Coordinating schedules and avoiding errors would require significant effort and careful planning. Think of coordinating train schedules across two time zones; it is a big task. Also, there are opinions against the proposal of two time zones."}

Some argue that having different time zones could create a sense of division, which needs to be handled carefully.
