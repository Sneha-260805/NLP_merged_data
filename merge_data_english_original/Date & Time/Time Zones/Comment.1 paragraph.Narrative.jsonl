I was in Mumbai, so it was two thirty P M I-S-T, but for her, it was one P M in the U-A-E. She kept saying, \"Call me at seven P M,\" and I had to keep clarifying if that was *her* seven P M or *my* seven P M! Took us a good ten minutes to figure out the one point five hour time difference. Next time, I’m just going to use a time zone converter and prepone the call instead of going through that again!"}
