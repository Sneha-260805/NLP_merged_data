Well, India might seem like one big happy family, but when it comes to time, things get a little…tricky. Officially, all of India follows Indian Standard Time (IST), which is GMT+5:30. This means we're 5 and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. Pretty simple, right? Not quite!", "normalised": "Ever wondered why your friend in Guwahati seems to be awake way before you in Mumbai?

{"unnormalised": "While the entire country *legally* observes IST, the sun doesn't quite agree. The difference in longitude between Gujarat in the west and Arunachal Pradesh in the east is substantial. Sunrise in Itanagar can be almost 2 hrs earlier than in Dwarka! Imagine starting your workday at 5:00 AM IST just because the sun's already up. No chai break could fix that!", "normalised": "While the entire country legally observes I-S-T, the sun doesn't quite agree.

{"unnormalised": "Historically, there were discussions about having two time zones to better align with sunrise and sunset times across the country. A proposed \"Eastern India Time\" would have been GMT+6:30, or IST+1 hr. This would mean people in states like Assam, Meghalaya, and Nagaland would be an hr ahead of the rest of India. Think of it as \"preponing\" your watch by 60 mins.", "normalised": "Historically, there were discussions about having two time zones to better align with sunrise and sunset times across the country.

{"unnormalised": "For now though, IST reigns supreme. This can sometimes lead to some interesting situations. For example, a cricket match starting at 14:30 IST feels very different depending on where you are in India. In the east, it's practically tea time, while in the west, it's still early afternoon. Companies often have to take this into account when scheduling meetings or deadlines.", "normalised": "For now though, I-S-T reigns supreme. This can sometimes lead to some interesting situations.

Next time you’re scheduling a call with someone from a different part of India, remember the sunrise difference, and maybe factor in a little extra time for them to enjoy their morning chai!", "normalised": "So, while India functions on a single time zone, the geographical realities mean that time is experienced differently across the nation.
