{"unnormalised": "First, he asked, \"If it's 2 PM here in Kolkata, what time is it in Los Angeles?\" I nearly choked on my chai! Los Angeles, Raju? You're going to need more than just a lucky guess!

{"unnormalised": "The best part? He wanted to know the precise minute difference. Like, if it's 2:03 PM IST, what exact minute it is in LA. I had to explain that time zones usually work in whole-hour offsets, though there are some quirky exceptions like Nepal Standard Time which is GMT+5:45. Can you imagine the confusion if everyone operated on such precise, non-standard offsets? Meetings would start at all sorts of weird times!", "normalised": "The best part?

{"unnormalised": "I also had to remind him about daylight saving time. He was all, \"Daylight...what now?\" I explained that most of the US observes DST, which means springing forward one hour in the summer.
