Like, if it's 9 AM in Mumbai, what time is it in Guwahati? They're both in India, so it should be straightforward, right? Turns out, not so much. I always get slightly messed up.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I have always been a bit confused about time zones, especially when coordinating with friends and family across India.
