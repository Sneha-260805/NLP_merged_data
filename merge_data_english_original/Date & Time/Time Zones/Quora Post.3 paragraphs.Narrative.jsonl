Turns out, 2 PM in India is like, 9:30 AM in London (GMT+1) and 4:30 AM in NYC (EST). My colleague, Aisha, gently explained to me that I need to use a time zone converter or something! She suggested I use UTC as the base, since everyone knows that. Lesson learned the hard way.", "normalised": "The first time it happened, I actually missed a crucial client presentation.

{"unnormalised": "Now, I always double-check the time zones. I prepone meetings that I know are hard for other teams and rotate the timings. I’ve even gotten pretty good at doing the mental math. For instance, if it's 10:00 AM IST, I know it's probably 5:30 AM in London. I also ask everyone to always include their timezone in any meeting invites.
