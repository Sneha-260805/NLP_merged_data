{"unnormalised": "However, countries like the US or the UK do observe DST, typically from March to November. This means that the difference between IST and EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) isn't a constant 9 hrs 30 mins, but changes depending on the time of year. For example, from March 12th, 2023 to Nov 5th, 2023, the time difference might be only 9 hrs and 30 mins, then it shifts back to 10 hrs 30 mins.
