{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked me about the pressure surrounding school exams in India, especially boards. I remember my own Class 10 ICSE exams pretty vividly. The whole year felt like prepping for a war, tbh. My parents enrolled me in 3 separate tution classes (Maths, Science, Eng Lit). Imagine the schedule! School from 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM, then tutions till 8 PM. My entire social life vanished. My marks _had_ to be above 90%, that was the unspoken rule. I studied for roughly 6-7 hours on an average day.", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about the pressure surrounding school exams in India, especially boards.

{"unnormalised": "The actual exam period was intense. The first paper was usually English, and the pressure of acing that one to set the tone was immense. I remember scoring 92 in English 1 (Language) and 95 in English 2 (Literature), which was considered pretty good, but still felt like a huge responsibility. The competition with my friends was friendly, but definitely present. Everyone compared scores right after the exam, discussing tricky questions and expected marks. I think I finally relaxed properly after my last exam, which was Computer Applications, where I was fairly confident.", "normalised": "The actual exam period was intense.

{"unnormalised": "Looking back, I think the whole system is designed to create unnecessary stress. While preparing, i remember comparing my scores to toppers from past years like the 98.6% achieved by some random person 2 years ago. All that is pretty useless and does more damage than good. The focus should be on learning, not just rote memorization to score high. Thankfully, my parents realized that later on and were way more chilled about my Class 12 CBSE.", "normalised": "Looking back, I think the whole system is designed to create unnecessary stress.
