My mom had to give him some Tulsi tea, which seemed to help at least temporarily, but it’s just not sustainable. I told my mom to tell him not to worry so much about getting a 10/10.", "normalised": "The thing that worries me the most is the impact on his mental health. He gets so anxious before every exam.

{"unnormalised": "It’s frustrating to see him go through this. I wish the education system in India would focus more on learning and less on rote memorization and scoring high marks. It's really about whether you can apply what you know, not just regurgitate facts on 3 hr long exam. I hope things get better for future generations. I even read that the new education policy is supposed to change this, and implement it by 2027 or so, but it feels so far away.", "normalised": "It's frustrating to see him go through this.

{"unnormalised": "Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. Just needed to get this off my chest. Wishing all the students appearing for their exams all the best!
