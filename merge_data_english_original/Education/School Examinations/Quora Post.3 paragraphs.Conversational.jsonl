Check the CBSE website for the latest updates - sometimes they make changes you don't want to miss. And don't just cram the night before! Start early, maybe 6 months or so before the exams, and create a realistic study schedule. Break down the syllabus into smaller chunks, and allocate time for each subject. For example, give more time to subjects like Maths and Science where you might need more practice with numericals and derivations.", "normalised": "Hey there!
