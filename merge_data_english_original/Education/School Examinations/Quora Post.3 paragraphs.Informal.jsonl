{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked me about how board exams are these days. Well, things have changed a bit since I gave my ICSE back in '08! For one, the marking schemes are different, and schools are prepping kids way earlier now. My younger cousin's already stressing about his Class 10 CBSE next year, even though it's only June! He's scoring around 85% in the practice tests, but still worried sick about Maths and Science.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, someone asked me about how board exams are these days.

Back in my day, anything over 90% in your 12th boards was considered amazing, but now it's pretty much the norm if you want to get into a good course. Plus, there's so much coaching now – FIITJEE for engineering, Allen for medicine, and a million others for everything else!", "normalised": "The pressure's definitely higher, what with cutoffs for colleges like Saint Stephen's and Hindu being insane.

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, it feels like the whole system is geared towards just cracking these exams. Sure, doing well opens doors, but there's more to life than just marks. My advice? Try your best, but don't let it consume you. And remember, 60% in practical life can get you further than 99% on a marksheet. Good luck to everyone appearing for their exams next year, be it 10th or 12th!", "normalised": "Honestly, it feels like the whole system is geared towards just cracking these exams.
