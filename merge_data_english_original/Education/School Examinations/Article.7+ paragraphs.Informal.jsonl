{"unnormalised": "The thing about school exams is that they’re not just about rote learning, though that definitely plays a role, especially in subjects like History. You've got to understand concepts, know how to apply them, and write coherent answers in a limited timeframe. Take Maths, for instance. Memorizing formulas is only half the battle. You need to solve problems, practice different variations, and for goodness sake, avoid silly mistakes!

Teachers, bless their souls, just want the best for you, but sometimes their expectations can be overwhelming. Especially with the competition these days.
