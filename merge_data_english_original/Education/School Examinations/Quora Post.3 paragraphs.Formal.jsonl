{"unnormalised": "Preparing for the CBSE Class 10 exams requires a strategic approach. Firstly, familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and syllabus, which is available on the CBSE website, cbse.nic.in. Pay close attention to the weightage assigned to different chapters. For instance, topics like \"Life Processes\" in Science and \"Real Numbers\" in Mathematics often carry significant marks. Creating a timetable that dedicates specific time slots to each subject is crucial. Remember to factor in breaks to avoid burnout.

Solve as many practice questions as possible from textbooks like NCERT and exemplar problems. Regularly attempt sample papers and previous years' question papers, such as those from 2020-2023. These papers help you understand the exam format, time management, and the types of questions asked. Moreover, consider seeking guidance from teachers or tutors for subjects you find challenging. Schools like DPS, Modern School, and Kendriya Vidyalaya usually conduct extra classes before exams.", "normalised": "Secondly, focus on conceptual clarity.
