Apparently, they’re giving more weightage to application-based questions this year. My school, St. Joseph's, didn't really prepare us for that. Any advice would be appreciated. Maybe I should just binge-watch some chill Bollywood movies before the exam to calm my nerves. Wish me luck!", "normalised": "Any tips on how to stay calm and focused during the exams?
