Schools like DPS, Modern School, and Kendriya Vidyalayas now incorporate projects, practical exams, and classroom participation into the final score. For example, in CBSE Class 10, internal assessments contribute 20 marks out of 100 in each subject. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of a student’s abilities, reducing the pressure associated with the final written examination.", "normalised": "One significant change observed over the past decade is the increased weightage given to internal assessments.
