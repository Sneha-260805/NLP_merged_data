I had aimed for Hindu College or SRCC, but my percentage was hovering around 92%. Back then, in 2015, anything below 95% felt like a rejection notice waiting to happen.

{"unnormalised": "The whole process felt like a gamble. Everyone was applying to multiple colleges, so predicting the actual cut-off list was impossible. I remember constantly refreshing the DU website, and the anxiety when the 1st cut-off list finally came out on 27/06/2015. I missed the mark for my preferred courses by a small margin, like 0.5%. Aisha was waitlisted, but luckily, made it in the 2nd cut-off list.", "normalised": "The whole process felt like a gamble.

{"unnormalised": "I ended up applying through the sports quota at IP College for Women. The trials were tough; I had to prove my badminton skills, but thankfully I secured a seat. It wasn't my first choice, but getting into DU was the main goal. A cousin suggested to also fill out the forms for private colleges like Amity University, Noida, just in case. He said the fees there were around ₹1.5 lakhs per year, but it's better than taking a drop year.", "normalised": "I ended up applying through the sports quota at I-P College for Women.

{"unnormalised": "Looking back, the entire admission process felt more dramatic than it needed to be. Now, with CUET, the process might be different, but I think the pressure remains the same. It's crucial to explore all options, from government colleges to private institutions, and even explore vocational courses if the traditional academic path doesn't work out. The key is to not lose hope and to remember that college is just one step in a much larger journey.", "normalised": "Looking back, the entire admission process felt more dramatic than it needed to be.
