Arts? Your 12th class marks matter a lot; like, 90+% can get you into a decent college, but for top places like IIT or AIIMS, you need to *really* nail the entrance exams.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about higher education admissions in India, eh?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of exams, JEE for engineering is a big one. NEET's the name of the game for medicos. For other courses, most universities have their own entrance tests (CUET now for many central universities) or consider your 12th marks directly. Application forms are usually online, so keep an eye on the university websites around Feb-March. The deadlines are tight – miss 'em, and you're basically sunk for that year. Registration fees vary but usually are around ₹500-₹2000 per application.", "normalised": "Speaking of exams, J-E-E for engineering is a big one. N-E-E-T is the name of the game for medicos.

{"unnormalised": "Here's a pro tip: don't put all your eggs in one basket. Apply to multiple colleges – seriously! You might get rejected from your dream college (IIT Delhi, for example), but have a good shot at something like NIT Trichy. Also, check for reservation policies. If you're SC/ST/OBC, you'll get some leeway in cutoffs, which can be a huge advantage. Keep all your documents handy: 10th and 12th mark sheets, caste certificate (if applicable), Aadhaar card, photos, etc.", "normalised": "Here's a pro tip: don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Do your research, prepare well, and stay positive.
