Getting into a good college, like say, St. Stephen's in Delhi or IIT Bombay, is super competitive. Everyone's aiming for that 99% mark, you know? And the cutoffs? Forget about it! Last year, some courses at Delhi University had cutoffs as high as 99.75%. Crazy, right?", "normalised": "So, someone asked about higher education admissions in India, eh?

You fill out application forms on the college websites, upload your documents (10th and 12th mark sheets, caste certificate if applicable, etc.), and pay the application fee. Then comes the nail-biting wait for the merit lists to be announced. Many colleges also conduct entrance exams, like CUET for central universities, JEE for engineering, and NEET for medical. So, you've gotta be prepared for those too. Some private colleges, like Manipal University, also have their own entrance tests.", "normalised": "The whole process is mostly online now, thank god.

Maybe arts, commerce or even vocational courses are more your thing. Colleges also offer various scholarships; make sure you look into those too.
