After scoring 92% in my 12th boards from Amity International School, I thought I was all set. Little did I know! I prepped for JEE Main like crazy, even joined a coaching class that cost Rs. 2 lakhs. Aiming for IIT Delhi, obviously, but reality hit hard.", "normalised": "So, someone asked me about how the whole college admission thing works in India, especially for engineering.

{"unnormalised": "JEE Main results came out and I scored a rank of 25,000. Not bad, but not IIT material either. Started looking at other options - private colleges. Manipal Institute of Technology was one, but their fees were like Rs. 4 lakhs per year! Then there's VIT, which takes admissions based on their own exam, VITEEE. My VITEEE rank was decent, around 10,000, which got me into ECE.", "normalised": "J-E-E Main results came out and I scored a rank of twenty five thousand. Not bad, but not I-I-T material either.
