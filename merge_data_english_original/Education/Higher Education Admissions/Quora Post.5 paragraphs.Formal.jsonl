{"unnormalised": "The process of seeking admission into institutions of higher education in India presents several challenges for students. One prevalent issue revolves around the sheer competitiveness, especially for coveted programs at top-tier establishments like IIT Delhi or IIM Ahmedabad. Securing a seat often necessitates exceptionally high scores in entrance exams, such as the JEE Advanced or CAT, placing immense pressure on aspirants. The limited number of seats available further exacerbates this competitive landscape.", "normalised": "The process of seeking admission into institutions of higher education in India presents several challenges for students.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant hurdle is the complexity and variability of admission criteria. Different universities and colleges often have unique requirements, application procedures, and deadlines. For example, Delhi University's cut-offs can fluctuate dramatically year-on-year, leaving students uncertain about their prospects. Navigating these diverse systems can be overwhelming, particularly for students from rural backgrounds who may lack access to adequate guidance. Many also apply to deemed universities and private colleges, which have differing criteria and entrance exams.", "normalised": "Another significant hurdle is the complexity and variability of admission criteria.

{"unnormalised": "Financial constraints represent a substantial barrier for many students. While government institutions offer subsidized tuition fees, the overall cost of higher education, including accommodation, books, and other expenses, can still be prohibitive. Private institutions, on the other hand, often charge significantly higher fees. Securing scholarships or educational loans becomes crucial, but the application processes can be cumbersome and often require extensive documentation. For example, obtaining a loan from SBI often involves collateral and guarantor requirements that some families struggle to meet.", "normalised": "Financial constraints represent a substantial barrier for many students.

{"unnormalised": "Information asymmetry is another challenge. Students, particularly those from less privileged backgrounds, may lack access to comprehensive and reliable information about available programs, career prospects, and financial aid options. This can lead to uninformed decisions and missed opportunities. Coaching centers often fill this gap, but their services can be expensive, creating a further divide between those who can afford them and those who cannot. Understanding the NIRF rankings and accreditation status of institutions also requires digital literacy, which is not universally available.", "normalised": "Information asymmetry is another challenge.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, the mental health of students is a growing concern during the admission process. The intense pressure to perform well, coupled with the uncertainty of securing admission, can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression. Counseling services and support systems are often inadequate, placing students at risk. Many students prepare for exams for 2+ years and the sheer pressure to 'crack' the exam is immense, especially when the success rate for NEET is less than 1%.", "normalised": "Finally, the mental health of students is a growing concern during the admission process.
