Suddenly you gotta prep for CET, NEET, JEE, and a bunch of other stuff depending on what you wanna study. My cousin, Priya, she's aiming for a BSc in Computer Science. She's already given her 12th board exams and is now stressing about the CUET UG 2024. It's mad, ya? Plus, each college also has its own cut-off marks, sometimes as high as 98%! How do they even expect students to get those kinds of scores?", "normalised": "What's the deal with all these entrance exams for college? It's like, you finish twelfth, right? And then BAM!

{"unnormalised": "Honestly, the whole higher education admission process feels super complicated. There needs to be a simpler, more accessible system, no? One where it’s not just about marks, but also about skill and aptitude. It's making my head spin just thinking about it, and I'm not even applying this year! I hope Priya gets into a good college, though. She's worked really hard, and honestly deserves it.", "normalised": "Honestly, the whole higher education admission process feels super complicated.
