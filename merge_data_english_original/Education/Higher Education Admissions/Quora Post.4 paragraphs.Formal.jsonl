Candidates must have completed their 10+2 (or equivalent) examination with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as compulsory subjects. A minimum aggregate percentage is usually specified, often around 75% for general category students, though relaxation is provided for reserved categories as per government norms. State-level engineering colleges often have domicile requirements to ensure local representation.", "normalised": "Besides entrance exam scores, educational qualifications also play a vital role.
