I'm particularly interested in how effective these schemes are in practice, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Has anyone had personal experience with schemes like the RTE Act, or perhaps the PM Scholarship Scheme? Would love to hear your thoughts.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, I wanted to start a discussion about government education schemes in India.

But I've also heard that some ppl think the infrastructure isn't always up to par in certain JNVs. Any opinions on that? Also, does anyone know what the current budget allocation is for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) for the FY 2024-25? I read an article saying it's supposed to be around Rs. 37,000 crore, but I'd like to confirm.", "normalised": "Specifically, I'm curious about the Navodaya Vidyalaya scheme.

{"unnormalised": "Finally, I'm trying to find more info on vocational training programs offered under the Skill India Mission that are tied to formal education initiatives. I saw a brochure mentioning courses certified by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), but it didn't give many details. Is it easy to access these programs, and do they really improve employability after completing a Class 10 or Class 12 certificate? Any insights would be appreciated!", "normalised": "Finally, I'm trying to find more info on vocational training programs offered under the Skill India Mission that are tied to formal education initiatives.
