Trying to keep track of them is like trying to herd cats wearing sarees on roller skates - chaotic! Plus, the eligibility criteria? Don't even get me started!

For example, the Scholarship for Higher Education for Young Achievers (SHREYAS) and the National Means cum Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS) help out bright sparks who might not otherwise be able to afford books or tuition. Some, like the RTE Act (Right to Education), are even legally binding! So, while navigating the application process might feel like climbing Mt. Everest barefoot, it's worth checking out if you or someone you know could benefit. Just be prepared to fill out approximately 74 forms, get them attested by 12 different people, and sacrifice a goat to the bureaucracy gods (okay, maybe not the goat part).", "normalised": "But jokes aside, some of these schemes can actually be a game changer for students, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds.

Do your research (google is your friend!), talk to people who have already gone through the process, and maybe keep a stress ball handy. And remember, education is the key to unlocking your potential, even if you have to wade through a sea of red tape to get there. All the best from someone who’s been there, done that, and still has the paper cuts to prove it! Good luck, you'll need it - but hey, at least now you can complain about it with accurate info!", "normalised": "Ultimately, understanding government education schemes is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube while blindfolded and riding a unicycle.
