I remember Amma switching on the news; the anchor, a sharp-dressed woman, was talking about a new government scheme, “PM SHRI Yojana.” I was probably 10 or 11, more interested in my comics, but the name stuck. Amma, a primary school teacher in our small village, was always keen on any news related to education.
