{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about govt education schemes in India. I can share my experience. My younger sister, Aisha, benefited a lot from the \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\" scheme. Our family lives in a small village near Lucknow, and initially, my parents were hesitant to send her to a private school. The fees were around Rs. 20,000 per year, which was a big amount for them. But, because of this scheme, they got a subsidy of ₹5000 per annum. This encouraged them to give her a better education.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about government education schemes in India. I can share my experience.

{"unnormalised": "Aisha studies in Class 8 now at St. Mary's School, and she’s doing really well. Besides the \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,\" she also gets free textbooks from the govt under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. I remember my father filling out a form with her Aadhaar no. for this. It was a bit of a hassle, but totally worth it. I think she is doing better in studies because she got good books in time and did not have to wait for us to buy her old books from another student. Her teachers, especially Mrs. Sharma, always encourage her to participate in extra-curricular activities too. She recently won 1st prize in a science competition!", "normalised": "Aisha studies in Class eight now at St. Mary's School, and she’s doing really well.

I encourage everyone to check the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) - you can find lots of schemes for different categories and income levels there. There are other state-level schemes too, like the one in Tamil Nadu that gives laptops to students who score above 90% in their Class 12 exams. Don’t miss out! It might change your life, just like it did for Aisha.", "normalised": "Honestly, without these schemes, her future might have been very different.
