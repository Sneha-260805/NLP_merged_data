His family's financial situation was really bad, and they couldn't afford the fees for senior secondary at a private school. Luckily, his schoolteacher told them about the \"Mukhyamantri Shiksha Protsahan Yojana\". They applied, and Raju got a scholarship that covered 75% of his fees! It was a huge relief.
