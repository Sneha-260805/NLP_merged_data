Now you see kids in even small villages using apps like BYJU's and Vedantu for IIT-JEE prep. My nephew in Patna is doing exactly that. He says his Physics teacher on Unacademy is better than the one at his coaching centre! Plus, he can watch the recorded lectures at 1.5x speed to save time.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about the future of online learning in India. Well, I think it's going to be huge!

{"unnormalised": "The biggest change I see is personalization. Earlier, everyone had to follow the same textbook, but now EdTech companies are using AI to tailor learning to each student’s needs. For example, Toppr analyses your weak areas after a mock test and suggests specific video lectures. Also, coding bootcamps like Masai School and Newton School are promising placements after a 6-month course. They claim an average salary of Rs. 6 LPA. Sounds promising, right?", "normalised": "The biggest change I see is personalization.

Govt. needs to invest more in infrastructure and digital literacy. Despite these hurdles, I'm optimistic. Online learning is democratizing education and giving access to quality content to millions of students in India. And it's only gonna get better. I mean, imagine learning Sanskrit from a teacher in Kashi while sitting in your home in Bangalore! Pretty cool, no?", "normalised": "However, some challenges remain.
