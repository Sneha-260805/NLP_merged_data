{"unnormalised": "One major advantage of online learning is its flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and revisit concepts as many times as needed. This is especially helpful for students struggling with subjects like Maths or Science. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also recognizes the importance of integrating technology into education, further boosting the EdTech sector. Plus, accessing quality education from top teachers across India becomes possible, regardless of your location.

Plus, the reliance on devices and internet connectivity can be a problem. Let’s say a student living in a village that experiences frequent power cuts wants to attend a live class scheduled for 4:00 PM; it may not always be feasible. Also, eye strain and other health issues can arise from prolonged screen time.", "normalised": "However, there are also challenges.
