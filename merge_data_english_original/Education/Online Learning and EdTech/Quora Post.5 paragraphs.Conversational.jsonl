{"unnormalised": "So, someone asked about the future of online learning in India, right? It's a pretty interesting topic, especially with the rise of so many EdTech companies. I think online learning is here to stay, but it'll definitely evolve. We've already seen a massive shift since 2020, when schools and colleges shut down and everyone was forced to study from home using platforms like Zoom and Google Meet. My younger brother, for example, was doing his entire Class 10 curriculum online.", "normalised": "So, someone asked about the future of online learning in India, right?

{"unnormalised": "One big change I foresee is more personalized learning. Imagine AI algorithms tailoring lesson plans to each student’s specific needs! Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, kids could learn at their own pace and focus on areas where they struggle. Plus, EdTech companies are constantly coming up with new features – interactive simulations, gamified learning, VR classrooms – all to keep students engaged. I saw on BYJU’s website they're offering courses starting from Rs. 999.", "normalised": "One big change I foresee is more personalized learning.

{"unnormalised": "However, some challenges still need to be addressed. Digital literacy is a huge one. Not everyone has access to a stable internet connection or a device. Think about students in rural areas or those from lower-income families. We also need to find ways to make online learning more engaging and less isolating. Sitting in front of a screen for 6 hours a day can be really draining, even with interactive content.", "normalised": "However, some challenges still need to be addressed.

{"unnormalised": "Another thing is the role of teachers. Online learning shouldn't replace teachers; it should complement them. Teachers can act as mentors and facilitators, guiding students through the online resources and providing personalized support. I think a blended approach – combining online and offline learning – is the most effective way forward. Some schools are already experimenting with this model, like DPS, which offers hybrid classes to its students.", "normalised": "Another thing is the role of teachers.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, I'm optimistic about the future of online learning in India. It has the potential to democratize education and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or background. But we need to be mindful of the challenges and work collaboratively to create a learning environment that is both effective and equitable. Hopefully, by 2030, online learning will be a seamless part of the Indian education system.", "normalised": "Overall, I'm optimistic about the future of online learning in India.
