{"unnormalised": "Well, that's a question I've been pondering myself, having seen my younger cousin prepping for IIT-JEE through online platforms. He spends hours glued to his laptop, attending lectures, attempting mock tests, and whatnot. Back in my day, it was all about commuting to Allen or FIITJEE, slogging through assignments with a massive group of students.

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest advantages of online learning, hands down, is the sheer accessibility. You can access quality content and top educators from literally anywhere. Someone in a small town like Deoria in UP can learn from a teacher in Kota without leaving their house. That’s a game changer, especially considering the cost. Physical coaching centers in cities like Delhi or Mumbai can be pretty expensive, think Rs. 1.5 lakh per year, easily. Online platforms often offer courses at significantly lower prices, sometimes even free content on YouTube or Unacademy.", "normalised": "one of the biggest advantages of online learning, hands down, is the sheer accessibility. you can access quality content and top educators from literally anywhere. someone in a small town like deoria in u-p can learn from a teacher in kota without leaving their house. that’s a game changer, especially considering the cost. physical coaching centers in cities like delhi or mumbai can be pretty expensive, think rupees one point five lakh per year, easily. online platforms often offer courses at significantly lower prices, sometimes even free content on youtube or unacademy."}
{"unnormalised": "Then there's the flexibility. You can learn at your own pace, revisit lectures as many times as needed, and schedule your studies around your other commitments. If you miss a live class, there's usually a recording available. This is super helpful for students juggling school, tuitions, and other extracurricular activities. My cousin, for instance, can watch recorded lectures at 11 PM if he's free, something unthinkable with physical coaching.", "normalised": "then there's the flexibility. you can learn at your own pace, revisit lectures as many times as needed, and schedule your studies around your other commitments. if you miss a live class, there's usually a recording available. this is super helpful for students juggling school, tuitions, and other extracurricular activities. my cousin, for instance, can watch recorded lectures at eleven p-m if he's free, something unthinkable with physical coaching."}
{"unnormalised": "However, let's not paint too rosy a picture. Online learning requires a high degree of self-discipline and motivation. It's easy to get distracted by social media or other online temptations. The lack of face-to-face interaction can also be a drawback for some students. You don't get the same level of personal attention and guidance as you would in a traditional classroom setting. It can be difficult to ask doubts and get immediate clarification. My cousin often complains that he has to wait for 24 hrs to get a response on his doubts from the teachers.", "normalised": "however, let's not paint too rosy a picture. online learning requires a high degree of self-discipline and motivation. it's easy to get distracted by social media or other online temptations. the lack of face-to-face interaction can also be a drawback for some students. you don't get the same level of personal attention and guidance as you would in a traditional classroom setting. it can be difficult to ask doubts and get immediate clarification. my cousin often complains that he has to wait for twenty four hours to get a response on his doubts from the teachers."}
{"unnormalised": "Also, the effectiveness of online learning depends a lot on the quality of the platform and the content. Not all online courses are created equal. Some may be poorly structured, outdated, or taught by inexperienced teachers. It's crucial to do your research and choose a reputable platform with a proven track record. Reviews on sites like Glassdoor or MouthShut can be invaluable.", "normalised": "also, the effectiveness of online learning depends a lot on the quality of the platform and the content. not all online courses are created equal. some may be poorly structured, outdated, or taught by inexperienced teachers. it's crucial to do your research and choose a reputable platform with a proven track record. reviews on sites like glassdoor or mouthshut can be invaluable."}

{"unnormalised": "So, is online learning effective? It can be, but it's not a magic bullet. It's a powerful tool that can be highly beneficial for students who are self-motivated, disciplined, and have access to quality content and reliable technology. For others, traditional coaching classes may still be the better option. It really depends on the individual's learning style, circumstances, and the quality of the online platform they choose. Think carefully, weigh your options, and then make a decision that works best for you. Perhaps a blended approach, combining the best of both worlds, is the way to go for many.", "normalised": "so, is online learning effective? it can be, but it's not a magic bullet. it's a powerful tool that can be highly beneficial for students who are self-motivated, disciplined, and have access to quality content and reliable technology. for others, traditional coaching classes may still be the better option. it really depends on the individual's learning style, circumstances, and the quality of the online platform they choose. think carefully, weigh your options, and then make a decision that works best for you. perhaps a blended approach, combining the best of both worlds, is the way to go for many."}
