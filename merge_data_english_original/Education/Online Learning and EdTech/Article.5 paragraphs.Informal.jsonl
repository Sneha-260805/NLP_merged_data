Now, everyone's doing it, from tiny tots learning their ABCs to professionals upskilling for their next promotion. Think about Byju's, Unacademy, Vedantu... these guys have totally changed the game. It's not just about recorded lectures anymore; it’s interactive sessions, personalized learning paths, and even virtual reality classrooms!

Still a struggle, especially in rural areas. And what about the cost? While there are free resources out there, the premium stuff – the really good courses with expert instructors – can be pricey. A top-tier MBA prep course can easily set you back Rs. 50,000. That's a lot of chai!", "normalised": "But let's be real, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. One big challenge is accessibility.

Are these courses really teaching relevant skills, or are they just churning out generic content? Students need to be savvy and do their homework before investing their time and money.
