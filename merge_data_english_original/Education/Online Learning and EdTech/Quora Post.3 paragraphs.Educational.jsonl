{"unnormalised": "Well, that's a common question these days! The rise of EdTech platforms like Byju's, Vedantu, and Unacademy has really changed the game. For students in smaller towns, accessing quality coaching for exams like IIT-JEE or NEET was tough. Now, with online classes, they can learn from the best teachers across India. Plus, the personalized learning these platforms offer, with features like adaptive testing and doubt-clearing sessions, is a big advantage. Many report scoring 90+% in their Class 10 boards after using these resources.", "normalised": "Well, that's a common question these days!

{"unnormalised": "However, it's not all sunshine and roses. Digital literacy is still a challenge in many parts of India. Not everyone has access to a stable internet connection or a decent smartphone/laptop. I saw a report that mentioned only about 40% of rural households have internet access. Also, the lack of face-to-face interaction can be a disadvantage for some students. They might miss out on the social interaction and peer learning that happens in a traditional classroom setting. It needs self-discipline too.", "normalised": "However, it's not all sunshine and roses. Digital literacy is still a challenge in many parts of India.

{"unnormalised": "Overall, online learning has the potential to be very effective in India, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. The effectiveness depends on several factors, including the student's learning style, access to technology, and the quality of the online program. It's important to remember that a good online course can supplement, but not necessarily replace, traditional schooling. And remember to check the reviews before signing up for any course - 4.5 stars and above is generally a good sign!", "normalised": "Overall, online learning has the potential to be very effective in India, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.
