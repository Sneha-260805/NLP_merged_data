On one hand, EdTech platforms like Byju's and Vedantu have democratized access to quality education, especially for students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Someone in Guwahati can now access coaching from the best teachers in Kota, which was previously unimaginable. Plus, the flexibility is a huge advantage. Kids can learn at their own pace, revisiting lessons as needed. Many report scoring better on exams; say, a student went from 75% in Maths to 85% after using online resources.", "normalised": "well, it's a mixed bag, honestly. on one hand, ed-tech platforms like byju's and vedantu have democratized access to quality education, especially for students in tier two and tier three cities. someone in guwahati can now access coaching from the best teachers in kota, which was previously unimaginable. plus, the flexibility is a huge advantage. kids can learn at their own pace, revisiting lessons as needed. many report scoring better on exams; say, a student went from seventy five percent in maths to eighty five percent after using online resources."}
{"unnormalised": "However, there are challenges. Digital literacy is a concern. Not every parent or student is comfortable navigating online platforms. Also, the lack of face-to-face interaction can be detrimental. Social skills and peer learning suffer. Then there's the issue of internet connectivity.

{"unnormalised": "Another significant issue is screen time. Staring at a device for 6-8 hours a day isn't healthy. Eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances are common complaints. We need to remember that education isn't just about academics; it's also about physical and mental well-being. Schools and parents need to ensure children also get 1-2 hrs of physical activity.", "normalised": "another significant issue is screen time. staring at a device for six to eight hours a day isn't healthy. eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances are common complaints. we need to remember that education isn't just about academics; it's also about physical and mental well-being. schools and parents need to ensure children also get one to two hours of physical activity."}

It's a powerful tool, but it needs to be used judiciously and in conjunction with traditional methods. For example, a blended approach of 3 days offline and 2 days online might work best for some students.", "normalised": "ultimately, the effectiveness of online learning depends on several factors: the quality of the platform, the student's discipline, parental involvement, and access to reliable internet. it's a powerful tool, but it needs to be used judiciously and in conjunction with traditional methods. for example, a blended approach of three days offline and two days online might work best for some students."}
