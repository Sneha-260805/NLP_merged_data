{"unnormalised": "Well, beta, that's like asking if you should only eat biryani for the rest of your life. Sounds amazing at first, right? No more daal-roti! Think of the convenience, tho! Your kid can learn Pythagorean theorem in their PJs at 11:30 PM. Plus, they get all these snazzy animated videos. My niece is obsessed with some edtech app, always wants to \"learn\" on her phone; probably just watching reels tbh. One big pro is definitely the personalized learning they offer. My neighbour's son apparently jumped from scoring 60% to 80% after using one of these platforms.", "normalised": "Well, beta, that's like asking if you should only eat biryani for the rest of your life.

{"unnormalised": "However, relying SOLELY on these apps? That's where the indigestion starts. Remember the importance of playing gully cricket or arguing over answers with your classmates? These platforms can isolate kids. No real social interaction. And let's be honest, sometimes the \"personalized\" stuff feels more like algorithms shoving the same content down everyone’s throats. Also, some of these courses are seriously expensive! Like, IIT coaching fees level expensive! My friend paid Rs. 50,000 for a 6-month subscription.", "normalised": "However, relying solely on these apps? That's where the indigestion starts.

{"unnormalised": "So, balance is key, ya! Think of these platforms as masala to spice up your kid’s educational journey, not the entire meal. Use them to supplement school, not replace it entirely. Maybe for extra practice or to understand tricky concepts. And for god's sake, limit their screen time! You don't want them needing chashmas at age 10, no? Consider a mix of online and offline tutoring.", "normalised": "So, balance is key, ya! Think of these platforms as masala to spice up your kid’s educational journey, not the entire meal.
