Plus, most platforms offer courses in different languages, like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc. My cousin in a small village in Bihar is learning English online – something that wasn't really possible before, right? Of course, you need decent internet access, which can still be a challenge in some areas, especially in rural India.
