{"unnormalised": "One significant area of unnormalized data lies within academic results. For instance, student performance is often expressed in varying formats, such as \"90%\" or \"90 marks out of 100\" or even grades like \"A+\" without a corresponding numerical value. Institutions like DPS, Ryan Intl., and Kendriya Vidyalayas each have slightly different grading systems, creating inconsistencies. Additionally, different boards such as CBSE, ICSE, and state boards further complicate the landscape with their diverse evaluation criteria. Normalizing this data requires sophisticated techniques to account for these disparities.", "normalised": "One significant area of unnormalized data lies within academic results.

{"unnormalised": "EdTech platforms themselves generate a wealth of unnormalized data. Course enrollments are often represented with abbreviations like \"Std. IX\" or \"Class 10th,\" requiring expansion and standardization. Time-based data, such as lecture schedules, may appear as \"3:30 PM\" or \"1530 hrs,\" necessitating a uniform representation. Furthermore, pricing information for online courses can be found as \"Rs 5000\" or \"INR 5,000,\" highlighting the need for currency normalization.", "normalised": "E-D-Tech platforms themselves generate a wealth of unnormalized data.
