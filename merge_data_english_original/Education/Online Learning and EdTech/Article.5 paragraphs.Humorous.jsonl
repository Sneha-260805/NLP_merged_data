{"unnormalised": "Online education in India, huh? It's gone from being that weird cousin nobody talked about at family functions to the star of the show, like that one uncle who made it big in Bollywood. Remember when “online classes” meant grainy videos and your internet buffering every 5 seconds? Good times… or not. Now we’ve got EdTech companies throwing around terms like \"AI-powered learning\" and \"personalized learning paths,\" which sounds suspiciously like something out of a sci-fi movie, not something to help little Rohan pass his Std. 8 exams.", "normalised": "Online education in India, huh?

{"unnormalised": "And the sheer number of options! From Byju's to Vedantu to Khan Academy (the OG online guru), it's like picking a chai at a wedding – overwhelming, but you know you’ll end up with something decent. It's a gold rush, frankly, with every company claiming to be the shortcut to IIT or NEET. I even saw an ad promising a 100% scholarship to Stanford if you just finish their \"revolutionary\" coding course. Sounds legit, right? Probably about as legit as that Baba offering to double your money in 21 days.", "normalised": "And the sheer number of options!

{"unnormalised": "But seriously, online learning has changed the game. Kids in remote villages can now access the same quality of education as those in posh Delhi schools. It’s democratizing education, which is fantastic. Unless, of course, their parents are hovering over them, making sure they're not watching YouTube videos instead of attending their 9:00 AM online class. My niece tried telling her mom that Clash of Clans was \"educational research\". Bless her heart.", "normalised": "But seriously, online learning has changed the game.
