{"unnormalised": "I grew up in a small town, you know, where access to quality education wasn't exactly abundant. The local school was okay, but the teachers were often overworked, and the resources were limited. Getting extra tuition meant travelling to a bigger city, which wasn't feasible for my family. That's where online learning came in. My parents enrolled me in a course on Byju's for mathematics in Class 10. Honestly, I was skeptical at first. I thought, how can learning happen through a screen? But I was pleasantly surprised. The video lectures were engaging, and the interactive quizzes helped me understand concepts better. The best part was, I could learn at my own pace. If I didn't understand something, I could just rewind and watch it again. That's something you can't do in a classroom. My score in maths improved from 60% in the previous year to 85% in the board exams.", "normalised": "I grew up in a small town, you know, where access to quality education was not exactly abundant.

{"unnormalised": "Then came college. I secured admission at a decent engineering college but the subjects felt very fast paced. It was difficult to keep up with the lectures, so I ended up looking up many topics from NPTEL and Coursera. The online lectures taught me the concepts in a lot more depth, and I could rewind and replay topics I did not follow easily. There was no such facility in physical classrooms. My grades improved significantly.", "normalised": "Then came college. I secured admission at a decent engineering college but the subjects felt very fast paced.

{"unnormalised": "I think the key is to be disciplined. It's easy to get distracted when you're learning from home, but if you can create a structured study schedule and stick to it, online learning can be incredibly effective. Some platforms also have doubt-clearing sessions, which can be really helpful. Many of my friends are doing courses on Unacademy and Vedantu, and they seem to be benefiting from them as well.", "normalised": "I think the key is to be disciplined.

It's not a perfect solution, but it can be a valuable tool for supplementing traditional learning, upskilling, and pursuing your passions.
