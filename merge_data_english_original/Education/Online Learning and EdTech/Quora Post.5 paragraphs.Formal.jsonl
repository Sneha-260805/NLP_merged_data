{"unnormalised": "Online learning in India has seen exponential growth, especially post-2020. Platforms like BYJU's and Vedantu claim to offer personalized learning experiences. But is it really as effective as traditional classroom teaching? One major concern is the digital divide. While students in metros like Mumbai and Bangalore have easy access to the internet, those in rural areas often struggle with connectivity. A survey conducted by NCERT in 2022 revealed that only 27% of students in rural India had access to a stable internet connection.", "normalised": "Online learning in India has seen exponential growth, especially post two thousand and twenty.

While online classes may offer convenience, they cannot replicate the classroom environment where students learn from their peers and teachers in person. Many educators at schools affiliated to CBSE believe that crucial social skills are developed in the physical classroom which are difficult to replicate online. A study published in the \"Indian Journal of Educational Technology\" found that students in traditional classrooms performed better in subjects requiring collaborative problem-solving skills.", "normalised": "Another issue is the lack of face-to-face interaction.

While some platforms offer high-quality content and qualified teachers, others are simply trying to capitalize on the growing demand for online learning. It's essential to carefully evaluate the credentials of the platform and the teachers before enrolling in any online course. Many EdTech companies have also been called out for aggressive sales tactics and misleading promises.", "normalised": "Furthermore, the quality of online education varies widely.

{"unnormalised": "However, online learning does offer certain advantages. It provides access to a wider range of courses and resources, allowing students to learn at their own pace. For instance, a student in Guwahati can now access coaching for IIT-JEE from the best teachers in Kota, something that was not possible before. Moreover, online learning can be more affordable than traditional classroom teaching, especially for students from low-income families. Several MOOC platforms like Coursera offer courses for as low as Rs. 500 per course.", "normalised": "However, online learning does offer certain advantages.
