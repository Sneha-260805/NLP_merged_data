{"unnormalised": "First off, **Time Management is KEY**. Seriously. Make a realistic timetable. Don’t try to cram 10 hrs of studying into a day when you have school from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM and then tuitions. Be honest about your current study habits and gradually increase the time you dedicate to JEE prep. Include everything – school homework, JEE coaching (if any), self-study, and of course, breaks! Remember the pomodoro technique - 25 mins study, 5 mins break. It really works.", "normalised": "First off, time management is key. Seriously. Make a realistic timetable.
