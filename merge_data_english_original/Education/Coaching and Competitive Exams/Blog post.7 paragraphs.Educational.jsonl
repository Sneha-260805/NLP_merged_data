They can clarify complex concepts and offer shortcuts and tricks to solve problems quickly. The rigorous test series, often modelled on the actual exam, provide valuable practice and help identify areas for improvement. Many centres boast experienced faculty, some with over 15 years of teaching experience, who understand the nuances of the exam. For instance, a physics teacher with a Ph.D. from IIT Delhi might conduct specialized doubt-clearing sessions.", "normalised": "However, it's crucial to understand what coaching classes offer and what they don't.

{"unnormalised": "Before enrolling in a coaching class, ask yourself some critical questions: What are my strengths and weaknesses? Do I need structured learning, or can I manage my studies independently? What is my budget? A weekend crash course might cost only Rs. 5000, whereas a comprehensive program can cost several lakhs.
