{"unnormalised": "It feels like just yesterday I was drowning in textbooks, fueled by endless cups of chai and the unwavering hope of cracking the JEE. The whole coaching industry seemed like a massive beast, promising success at the cost of sanity, and honestly, I was both terrified and excited.

{"unnormalised": "Leaving home was tough. I missed mom’s cooking, the familiar chaos of my Delhi neighborhood, even arguing with my younger brother. Kota was… different. It was all about the grind. Every waking moment was dedicated to physics, chemistry, and maths. Early morning classes started at 7:00 AM sharp, followed by hours of practice problems. We barely had time to breathe, let alone think about anything else. Mock tests every Sunday were like mini-Jee's, setting our anxiety levels through the roof. I remember one test where I scored a measly 120/360. Devastating!", "normalised": "Leaving home was tough.

{"unnormalised": "The pressure was immense. Everyone around me seemed so much smarter, faster, and more dedicated. The competition was cutthroat. I’d hear whispers of students studying till 3:00 AM, solving problems I couldn’t even comprehend. There were days when I felt like giving up, like I wasn’t cut out for this. My friends back in Delhi were having fun, while I was stuck in a cycle of studying, testing, and feeling inadequate.", "normalised": "The pressure was immense.

{"unnormalised": "But amidst the stress and self-doubt, there were also moments of camaraderie. We'd huddle together during breaks, comparing notes, sharing shortcuts, and trying to decipher particularly nasty problems. There were also the teachers, some of whom truly cared. Mr. Sharma in Physics, for instance, had a knack for explaining complex concepts in a way that even I could understand. He really pushed me to think critically, not just memorize formulas. He even predicted one question would come for sure, and it did! ", "normalised": "But amidst the stress and self-doubt, there were also moments of camaraderie.
