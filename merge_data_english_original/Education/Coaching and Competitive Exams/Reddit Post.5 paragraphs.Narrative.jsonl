First attempt, I blindly joined FIITJEE – everyone in my Delhi neighborhood was going there. Paid like Rs. 2.5 lakh for the 2-year program. Honestly, felt like I was just another number.

{"unnormalised": "Second time around, I realized I needed something different. A friend recommended a smaller coaching center near my house, Vidyamandir Classes (VMC). Way more personalized attention, teachers were actually invested. Plus, it was cheaper, maybe around Rs. 1.8 lakh. Still a lot of money, obvio. I saw significant improvement using their material-solving techniques, and also religiously solved past 10 years papers.", "normalised": "Second time around, I realized I needed something different.

{"unnormalised": "A word of advice, especially for the younger peeps preparing now: don't just follow the herd. Do your research, figure out what works best for YOU. Don’t just blindly trust any institute which claims you get 100% success. Some of my friends at Allen (Kota) felt same as my initial feeling at FIITJEE. Take mock tests seriously, analyze your mistakes, and don't be afraid to ask for help. And most importantly, remember to take breaks!
