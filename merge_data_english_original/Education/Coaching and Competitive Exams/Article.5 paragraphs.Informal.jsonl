That's where coaching centres come in. There are so many options these days, from big names like FIITJEE and Aakash to smaller, local coaching classes. Choosing the right one can seriously impact your chances of scoring well.

{"unnormalised": "One of the biggest dilemmas is whether to join a coaching centre right after class 10th or wait till 11th. Some believe starting early gives you an edge. They feel like it gives you enough time to cover the extensive syllabus. Others argue that it’s too much pressure too soon. They suggest focusing on your board exams first. Plus, the coaching fee is not cheap; Aakash charges ₹2,00,000 per year for their medical entrance program.", "normalised": "One of the biggest dilemmas is whether to join a coaching center right after class tenth or wait till eleventh.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the online vs. offline debate. Online coaching has become super popular post-COVID. Platforms like Vedantu and Byju's offer live classes, recorded lectures, and tons of practice material. It's convenient and often more affordable. My friend, Priya, swears by Unacademy. She says their doubt-clearing sessions are a lifesaver. Offline coaching, on the other hand, gives you that classroom environment and direct interaction with teachers. Some students really thrive in that setting.", "normalised": "Then there's the online versus offline debate. Online coaching has become super popular post-C-O-V-I-D.

{"unnormalised": "But let's be real, coaching isn't a magic bullet. You still need to put in the hard work yourself. Consistent study habits, regular revisions, and mock tests are crucial. Coaching classes usually conduct mock tests based on the actual exam pattern. So, the key is finding a balance. Utilize the resources provided by your coaching centre, but don't rely on them completely. Self-study is still super important.
