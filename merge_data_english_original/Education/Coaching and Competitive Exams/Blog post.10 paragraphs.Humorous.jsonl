{"unnormalised": "So, you wanna crack JEE? NEET? UPSC? Welcome to the coaching circus, my friend! Prepare for a wild ride filled with sleepless nights, questionable mess food, and enough chai to float a small boat. You think you're signing up for education? Nah, you're enrolling in an Olympic sport of stress, where the gold medal is a seat in that coveted IIT or AIIMS. Let's be real, 12th standard results with 98% are now considered “average” thanks to our friend, the coaching industry.", "normalised": "So, you wanna crack J-E-E? N-E-E-T? U-P-S-C?

{"unnormalised": "First, the fees. Let's talk about the fees. They're so high, you'd think they're funding a space mission to Mars. Rs. 2.5 lakhs for a two-year program? My auto-rickshaw driver doesn't earn that much in a lifetime! And don’t even THINK about asking for a discount. The manager will look at you like you've just asked to borrow his kidney. You'll probably need a personal loan from SBI just to cover the costs.", "normalised": "First, the fees. Let's talk about the fees.

{"unnormalised": "Then there's the teaching. Some teachers are genuinely brilliant, explaining concepts so clearly even your dadi can understand. Others...well, let's just say they're better suited for writing Bollywood dialogues. Prepare to hear gems like, \"This is super important!

{"unnormalised": "The study material? Mountains of it! Enough to build a small fort in your room. You'll have textbooks, workbooks, past papers, sample papers, mock tests, grand tests, and enough miscellaneous sheets to wallpaper your entire house. Good luck trying to keep it all organized.

{"unnormalised": "And the competition? Oh, the competition! It's fiercer than a catfight over a bowl of milk. You'll be surrounded by geniuses who seem to have memorized the entire NCERT textbook backward. Don't be surprised if someone finishes a mock test in 15 minutes while you're still struggling to understand the first question. Just remember, everyone feels the pressure, even those smug-looking toppers.", "normalised": "And the competition? Oh, the competition! It's fiercer than a catfight over a bowl of milk.

Wake up at 6:00 AM (if you're lucky), cram in some studying before classes, attend lectures that feel like they're three hours long, struggle through homework until midnight, and then repeat the cycle all over again.

{"unnormalised": "Let’s talk about the food! Ah yes, hostel or PG food. Prepare for a culinary adventure of blandness. The dal will taste like dishwater, the roti will be harder than a hockey puck, and the vegetables will be swimming in an ocean of oil.
