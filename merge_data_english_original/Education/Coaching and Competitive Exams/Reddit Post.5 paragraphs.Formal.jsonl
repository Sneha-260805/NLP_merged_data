{"unnormalised": "The prevalence of coaching centres in India is undeniable. From FIITJEE to Aakash, these institutions promise comprehensive guidance and structured learning to crack exams like NEET and JEE. The question is, do they truly deliver on this promise, or are they merely a commercial enterprise exploiting the pressures faced by students?

{"unnormalised": "One aspect that concerns me is the intensity of the coaching schedule. Many centres conduct classes for 6-8 hrs daily, leaving students with little time for self-study or other activities. The syllabus is often rushed, and the focus is primarily on rote learning rather than conceptual understanding. This can be detrimental to students in the long run, even if they manage to score well in the entrance exams. Furthermore, fees can be exorbitant, often exceeding Rs. 2,00,000 for a 2-year program.", "normalised": "One aspect that concerns me is the intensity of the coaching schedule.
