{"unnormalised": "My main concern is the teaching methodology. Some people say FIITJEE focuses too much on advanced concepts too early, while others swear by Allen's structured approach. Is it true that VMC has the best faculty for Maths? My Math is pretty weak, and I really need help boosting my score. Any insights on the faculty at these different institutes would be highly appreciated. Specifically, anyone knows about Mr. Sharma at FIITJEE South Delhi?", "normalised": "My main concern is the teaching methodology.
