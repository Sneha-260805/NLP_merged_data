{"unnormalised": "So, you've decided to prep for a competitive exam, huh? That's a big decision, and honestly, it can feel a bit like climbing Mount Everest in chappals. But don’t sweat it! With the right coaching and a solid strategy, you can absolutely nail it. Let's talk about coaching centres – are they worth the hype? Well, it depends. A good coaching centre, like FIITJEE for JEE or Vidyamandir Classes (VMC) for various entrance exams, can give you structured learning, mock tests, and experienced teachers. Imagine trying to learn advanced calculus alone versus having a Prof. explain it step-by-step. Makes a difference, right?", "normalised": "So, you've decided to prep for a competitive exam, huh?

{"unnormalised": "First things first, figure out what kind of learner you are. Do you thrive in a classroom setting, or are you more of a self-study ninja? If you're the classroom type, then coaching is probably a good fit. Institutions like Allen Career Institute (Kota) have a reputation for intense, structured programs. They often have a \"dummy school\" system where you don’t have to attend regular school and can focus solely on exam prep. But remember, coaching isn’t a magic bullet. You gotta put in the hours too.", "normalised": "First things first, figure out what kind of learner you are. Do you thrive in a classroom setting, or are you more of a self-study ninja?

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of hours, let's get real about the time commitment. Expect to dedicate a significant chunk of your day to studying. A typical coaching schedule might involve 6-8 hrs of classes, followed by self-study and practice. Don't underestimate the importance of mock tests! They simulate the actual exam environment and help you identify your weak areas. Most coaching centres, like Aakash Institute, conduct regular mock tests, like the AIATS series, to gauge your progress.", "normalised": "Speaking of hours, let's get real about the time commitment.
