{"unnormalised": "Then there's the question of online vs. offline. Offline coaching, especially in hubs like Kota, Rajasthan, offers a highly structured environment. You're surrounded by peers, have direct access to teachers for doubt clearing, and follow a strict timetable. But it also means potentially relocating, higher fees (Rs. 1.5 lakh+ per year), and the pressure cooker atmosphere that Kota is famous (or infamous) for. Online coaching, on the other hand, offers flexibility. You can attend live classes from anywhere with a good internet connection, watch recorded lectures at your own pace, and often at a lower cost (around Rs. 50,000 - 1 lakh per year). The downside? Requires self-discipline and can feel isolating.", "normalised": "Then there's the question of online versus offline.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of fees, don't just look at the sticker price. Check what's included. Are study materials provided? How many mock tests are conducted? Does the fee cover accommodation if you opt for an offline center? Some coaching centers also offer scholarships based on merit or financial need. Explore all options before committing. For instance, many offer a 10% discount if you pay before 31/03.", "normalised": "Speaking of fees, don't just look at the sticker price. Check what's included. Are study materials provided?
