{"unnormalised": "But here's the thing: coaching isn't a magic bullet. Sure, it can provide structure, guidance, and a competitive environment. But it also breeds a culture of rote learning and dependence. Students often become reliant on the coaching centre's notes and shortcuts, instead of developing a deep understanding of the concepts themselves. Plus, the intense pressure and competition can take a toll on mental health. Think about it: spending 10-12 hours a day studying, attending classes, and taking mock tests? That's not exactly a balanced life.", "normalised": "But here's the thing: coaching isn't a magic bullet. Sure, it can provide structure, guidance, and a competitive environment.
