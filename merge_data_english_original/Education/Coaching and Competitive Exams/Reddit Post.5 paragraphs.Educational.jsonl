{"unnormalised": "Also, how important are mock tests, really? I mean, I understand they're helpful, but are they worth the time investment, especially when you're already juggling so much? For NEET, should I focus more on Biology (Botany and Zoology) considering its weightage, or give equal attention to Physics and Chemistry too? Is the NCERT enough, or do I need to refer to additional textbooks? My current study hours are around 6 hrs per day, is this sufficient?", "normalised": "Also, how important are mock tests, really?
