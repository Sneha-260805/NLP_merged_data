Their websites all claim to be the best, but I'd appreciate hearing about actual student experiences, the quality of the teaching staff, and the effectiveness of their study materials.

{"unnormalised": "Beyond the major players, are there any smaller, local coaching centers in Kolkata that you'd recommend? Sometimes these lesser-known institutes offer more personalized attention, which could be valuable for a student who needs extra support. The local coaching center named 'Apex Institute', located on Gariahat Road, claims to have a good track record of students scoring above 90% in board exams and securing good ranks in the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (WBJEE). Has anyone got inputs on this?", "normalised": "Beyond the major players, are there any smaller, local coaching centers in Kolkata that you'd recommend?

{"unnormalised": "Another consideration is the timing of joining coaching. Should my sibling start now, in Class 11, or wait until Class 12? I understand that starting early allows for more in-depth coverage of the syllabus, but I also worry about burnout. Perhaps joining now and focusing on building a strong foundation in key concepts, followed by more intensive preparation in Class 12? What are your thoughts on this? Additionally, what sort of study hours one should target per day if they start coaching in class 11? Is 4-5 hours per day (excluding coaching hours) sufficient?", "normalised": "Another consideration is the timing of joining coaching.

Cost is also a factor, with many of these coaching programs costing upwards of Rs. 1.5 lakh per year.
