I live in Patna and there seem to be a lot of options - FIITJEE, Allen, Aakash, Resonance, and some local institutes as well. Does anyone have experience with any of these, specifically in Patna? Any insights into their teaching methodology, faculty quality, and study material would be greatly appreciated. My target score is 650+ and I want to secure a seat in AIIMS Delhi.", "normalised": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice regarding coaching centers for the N-E-E-T exam.

Platforms like Unacademy and Vedantu are quite popular, but I'm not sure if the online format will suit my learning style. I'm someone who prefers a structured classroom environment.
