Everyone and their uncle seems to be prepping for these competitive exams. I initially thought self-study was the way to go, but after a few months of floundering, I caved and joined a coaching center.", "normalised": "First off, let us be real: scoring ninety percent in your twelfth boards doesn't guarantee you a seat at I-I-T.

{"unnormalised": "The big question: Which one? Delhi has a ton – FIITJEE, Aakash, Resonance... the list goes on! My friend Rohan swore by Allen Career Institute, Kota, but moving there wasn't an option. I ended up enrolling in a local branch of Vidyamandir Classes (VMC) after a friend's recommendation. The fees were approx. Rs. 1.5 lakh per year, which felt like a huge sum at the time.", "normalised": "The big question: Which one?

{"unnormalised": "The classes were intense! We had 6-hour sessions, 6 days a week. They hammered concepts relentlessly. I recall spending almost 4 hrs every day after class revising stuff and doing homework. It was a grind, no doubt.

{"unnormalised": "One thing I underestimated was the pressure. Comparing yourself to others is inevitable, and it can be incredibly demotivating. Seeing some classmates consistently scoring 250/300 in the mock tests while I was struggling to cross 150 was tough. I almost gave up a couple of times. Plus, juggling board exam prep with the JEE syllabus was a nightmare. Many students start preparing right from class 11, which I wish I had done.", "normalised": "One thing I underestimated was the pressure.

{"unnormalised": "Looking back, I think coaching classes are beneficial, but not a magic bullet. They provide the resources and guidance, but ultimately, it's your effort and dedication that determine your success. And remember, the IIT-JEE isn't the be-all and end-all.
