He's aiming for engineering, so obviously JEE is the big hurdle. We're in Delhi, and the coaching scene here is intense. He scored a decent 85% in his 10th, so not stellar, but definitely has the potential to crack JEE with the right guidance, I think.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, need some advice!

{"unnormalised": "Then there’s the question of integrated school programs. Some schools, like DPS R.K. Puram, offer JEE coaching alongside the 11th and 12th syllabus.
