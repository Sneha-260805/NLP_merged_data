{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm thinking of prepping for the JEE next year, and I'm totally confused about coaching options. There's FIITJEE, Allen, Aakash... the list is endless! Does anyone have personal experience or know someone who went to a particular coaching center in, say, Kota or Delhi? I’m really looking for insights into the teaching methods, the study materials (do they actually cover the syllabus?), and the overall environment.", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm thinking of prepping for the J-E-E next year, and I'm totally confused about coaching options.

{"unnormalised": "I’ve heard stories of insane competition and pressure, and I'm honestly a bit worried about that aspect. I’m aiming for a good rank, obviously, but not at the cost of my mental health. Is there a coaching that focuses on conceptual understanding rather than just rote learning? I'd prefer that.", "normalised": "I’ve heard stories of insane competition and pressure, and I'm honestly a bit worried about that aspect.

{"unnormalised": "Also, a huge question for me is the cost. Coaching fees are skyrocketing! Does anyone know what the average fees are for a 2-year program at, say, Allen Kota? I’ve seen numbers ranging from Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. Are there scholarships available, and how tough is it to get one? My parents are supportive, but budget is definitely a constraint. And is it really worth the investment, or are there equally good (or better) online options these days? I see a lot of ads for Byju's and Vedantu.", "normalised": "Also, a huge question for me is the cost. Coaching fees are skyrocketing!

{"unnormalised": "Then, there’s the whole debate about whether online coaching is even effective. Can you really get the same level of doubt clearing and personal attention as you would in a physical classroom? I'm worried I won't be able to keep up my motivation without the in-person interaction.", "normalised": "Then, there’s the whole debate about whether online coaching is even effective.

{"unnormalised": "And what about the teaching quality? Are all teachers equally good across all branches of a coaching center, or does it vary a lot? I’m also wondering if any of the coachings provide extra help with subjects that aren't directly part of the JEE syllabus but are still crucial for board exams like English. My board exams have a lot of weightage so I cant neglect it.", "normalised": "And what about the teaching quality?

{"unnormalised": "Finally, does anyone have experience with specific teachers at these coaching centers? Recommendations would be hugely appreciated!
