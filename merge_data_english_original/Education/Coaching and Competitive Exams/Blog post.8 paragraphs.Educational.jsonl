{"unnormalised": "First, understand your individual learning style. Are you a visual learner who benefits from interactive lectures and diagrams? Or do you prefer a more self-directed approach, focusing on practice questions and personalized feedback? Different coaching centers offer varying teaching methodologies. Some, like FIITJEE or Allen, are known for their rigorous, structured programs focusing on building a strong foundation from Class 11 onwards. Others, such as local tutorial centers, might offer a more flexible approach. Check if demo classes are available.
