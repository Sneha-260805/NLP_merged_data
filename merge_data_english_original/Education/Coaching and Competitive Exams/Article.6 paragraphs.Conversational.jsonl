{"unnormalised": "First off, let's talk coaching. You've got options, from the big names like FIITJEE and Aakash, to the smaller, more personalized academies. For JEE, many aim for a rank under 1000. Which is better? Depends entirely on your learning style. Some folks thrive in a large classroom setting with lots of resources. Others prefer the one-on-one attention you get from a smaller institute. Do your research! Check out student reviews, talk to alumni, and even sit in on a demo class if possible. Don't just blindly follow the herd.", "normalised": "First off, let's talk coaching. You've got options, from the big names like F-I-I-T-J-E-E and Aakash, to the smaller, more personalized academies.

Are they actually good at explaining complex concepts in a way that you can understand? This is crucial, especially when tackling subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. The NEET exam, for example, requires deep understanding of Bio, Chem, and Physics.", "normalised": "And it's not just about the institute's reputation. Look at the faculty. How experienced are they?

Solve mock tests, previous year question papers, anything you can get your hands on. Analyse your mistakes, figure out why you went wrong, and learn from them. Time management is also crucial. You need to be able to answer questions quickly and accurately under pressure. Aim to complete each question in under 2 mins.", "normalised": "Now, for the exams themselves.

Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and taking breaks. Go for a walk, listen to music, or spend time with friends. Your mental and physical health are just as important as your academic preparation.
