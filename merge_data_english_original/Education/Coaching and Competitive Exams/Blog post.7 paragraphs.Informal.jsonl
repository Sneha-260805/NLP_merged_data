{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about the format. Online or offline coaching? That's the million-dollar question. Online has its perks – you can study in your pajamas, rewind lectures (bless you, rewind button!), and save on travel time. Think about institutes like Unacademy, or Vedantu - they have some pretty solid online courses for JEE and NEET prep. Offline, on the other hand, gives you that in-person interaction, the ability to pester teachers face-to-face, and a structured classroom environment. Both have their pros and cons. Figure out which one suits your learning style. Consider enrolling for a free demo class. Most of them offer one.", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about the format. Online or offline coaching?

{"unnormalised": "And then there's the whole question of self-study vs. coaching. Can you crack it on your own? Absolutely! Plenty of people do. But coaching can give you that extra edge, the structured approach, the shortcuts, and the doubt-clearing sessions. Think of it like this: you *can* build a house yourself, but hiring a contractor might just make the whole process a whole lot smoother and faster. Many successful students have achieved top ranks after joining a coaching program. For example, AIR 1 in NEET 2023, Prabanjan J, was a student of Allen Career Institute.", "normalised": "And then there's the whole question of self-study versus coaching.

{"unnormalised": "Speaking of time, managing your schedule is crucial. Coaching classes, school, homework, self-study – it can all get overwhelming. Make a timetable and stick to it! Allocate specific hours for each subject and don't forget to factor in breaks. Trust me, staring at a textbook for 12 hrs straight will only result in brain meltdown. Also, sleep! 7-8 hrs minimum. No excuses. Your brain needs to recharge.", "normalised": "Speaking of time, managing your schedule is crucial. Coaching classes, school, homework, self-study – it can all get overwhelming.

{"unnormalised": "Don't underestimate the power of mock tests. They are like the dress rehearsals before the actual performance. Take them seriously, analyze your mistakes, and learn from them.

This happens usually after every 2 weeks. Try and give as many mocks as possible.", "normalised": "Don't underestimate the power of mock tests.
