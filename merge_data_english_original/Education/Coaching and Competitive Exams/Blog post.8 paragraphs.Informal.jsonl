{"unnormalised": "Now, choosing the right coaching is like choosing the right chai. Everyone has their preferences. Some swear by the big names like Allen or Aakash (especially for medical), while others prefer smaller, local centres with experienced teachers. Ask around, talk to seniors, check online reviews (but take them with a pinch of salt – especially the ones praising “Mr. Sharma Sir” too enthusiastically, could be planted!).

{"unnormalised": "Online vs. Offline? That’s the big question these days. Online coaching is convenient, flexible (you can study in your pyjamas!), and often cheaper.
