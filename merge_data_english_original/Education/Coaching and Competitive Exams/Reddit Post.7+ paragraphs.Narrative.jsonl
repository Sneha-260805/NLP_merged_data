Feeling a bit lost and hoping some of you can offer some advice. I'm prepping for the N-E-E-T exam next year, two thousand and twenty five, and the coaching scene in Kota is… intense, to say the least. I'm from a small town near Guwahati, Assam, and the culture shock is real, especially the pressure."}

Big mistake? Maybe. I joined a \"reputed\" institute, let's call it 'Vidyapeeth Classes'. They promised the moon – top faculty, personalized attention, rigorous testing. Reality? It's more like a factory churning out potential doctors. They have a batch system, and you're basically forgotten if you don't make it to the top ten percent in the weekly tests. My rank is usually around five hundred out of two thousand students. Not great, I know."}

Classes from eight A-M to two P-M, then \"doubt clearing sessions\" which are basically just overcrowded rooms with stressed-out teachers, and then mandatory study hours till nine P-M.
