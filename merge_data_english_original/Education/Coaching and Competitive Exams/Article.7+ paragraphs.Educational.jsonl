{"unnormalised": "A key factor to consider is the faculty expertise. Do they have a proven track record of helping students succeed? Are they approachable and able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner? Reputable institutes usually boast a team of experienced teachers, many of whom are IIT or AIIMS alumni themselves. It's worthwhile to attend demo classes or speak to current students to gauge the quality of instruction. Some even have guest lectures by IIT professors.", "normalised": "A key factor to consider is the faculty expertise. Do they have a proven track record of helping students succeed?

Cracking the IIT-JEE or NEET needs not only coaching, but also self-study of 6+ hours/day. Good Luck!", "normalised": "Finally, remember that coaching is just one piece of the puzzle.
