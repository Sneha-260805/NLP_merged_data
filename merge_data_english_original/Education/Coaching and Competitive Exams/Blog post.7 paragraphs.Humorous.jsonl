{"unnormalised": "First things first, accept the fact that your social life is about to become as extinct as the dodo. Parties? Movies? Hanging out with friends? Those are just distant memories now. Your new best friends are H.C. Verma (the physics guru) and R.D. Sharma (the math magician, or monster, depending on your aptitude). Try to befriend them, they hold the keys (and formulas) to your potential future. Plan on studying at least 10 hrs a day, min. And don't even *think* about pulling an all-nighter right before the exam. Bad idea, trust me.", "normalised": "First things first, accept the fact that your social life is about to become as extinct as the dodo. Parties? Movies? Hanging out with friends?

{"unnormalised": "Now, let's talk about coaching classes. Are they necessary? Well, that depends. Are you a child prodigy who can solve complex problems in their sleep? If yes, congratulations, you can probably skip them. For the rest of us mere mortals, a good coaching center like FIITJEE or Allen Career Institute can be invaluable. They’ll give you a structured approach, tons of practice problems, and the illusion that you're actually making progress. And remember, the coaching center fees are only ₹2,00,000+ per year! Bargain!", "normalised": "Now, let's talk about coaching classes. Are they necessary? Well, that depends. Are you a child prodigy who can solve complex problems in their sleep?

{"unnormalised": "The syllabus? Oh, the syllabus. It's basically a compilation of everything you've ever learned in science and math, plus a few extra topics just to mess with you. Don't even attempt to memorize everything. Focus on understanding the concepts. And for the love of all that is holy, practice, practice, practice! Solve problems until your fingers ache and your eyes bleed. Aim for 100+ questions per topic. Just kidding...sort of.", "normalised": "The syllabus? Oh, the syllabus.

{"unnormalised": "But hey, it's not all doom and gloom. There will be moments of triumph, like when you finally solve that one ridiculously difficult problem after hours of struggling.

{"unnormalised": "Remember to take breaks. Seriously. Your brain needs time to recharge. Go for a walk, listen to music, or watch a funny video.

Just try your best, stay positive (or at least mildly optimistic), and remember to laugh along the way. After all, what's life without a little bit of absurdity? You got this (maybe) ... or at least you'll have a really good story to tell at parties later on. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favour, or at least slightly better than your neighbour's!", "normalised": "Finally, don't forget to breathe.
