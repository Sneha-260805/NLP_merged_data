{"unnormalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm prepping for the IIT-JEE and feeling a bit overwhelmed. There's like, a gazillion coaching centres in Kota and Delhi. Anyone have any recommendations? I’ve heard good things about FIITJEE and Allen, but they're so expensive! Like, upwards of Rs. 2 lakh per year. Is it really worth the hype, or are there other, maybe less known but equally good options? I'm aiming for a score that will get me into the top 5 IITs, so the pressure is real, ya know?", "normalised": "Hey everyone, so I'm prepping for the I-I-T J-E-E and feeling a bit overwhelmed.

{"unnormalised": "I’m also confused about online vs. offline coaching. Some friends are swearing by Unacademy and Vedantu. They say it’s more flexible and you can learn at your own pace. Plus, it's definitely cheaper, maybe around Rs. 50,000- Rs. 80,000 for a complete course. But I worry about the discipline and doubt-clearing. Does anyone have experience with online coaching for JEE? Specifically, can you really get your doubts solved effectively via chat or video call, or is it better to have a teacher physically there? I plan to start seriously studying from 15/06/2024.", "normalised": "I'm also confused about online versus offline coaching. Some friends are swearing by Unacademy and Vedantu.

{"unnormalised": "Also, is it worth taking a drop year? My cousin scored like, 98 percentile in his first attempt but didn't get into his desired branch (CSE). He took a drop year and then cracked it with flying colours. But I'm scared of wasting a year. What are your thoughts on drop years, considering the competition these days? Any advice would be super helpful! Thanks, bhai log!", "normalised": "Also, is it worth taking a drop year?
