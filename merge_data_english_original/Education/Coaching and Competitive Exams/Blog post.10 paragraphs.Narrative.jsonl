Like every other science student in my Patna neighborhood, the I-I-T dream was planted firmly in my head. My parents, bless their souls, thought a good coaching center was the key. \"Kota is the place, beta,\" my father declared, having read endless articles about A-I-R one, A-I-R two, and the like."}

My parents, bless their souls, thought a good coaching center was the key. \"Kota is the place, beta,\" my father declared, having read endless articles about AIR 1, AIR 2, and the like.", "normalised": "So, off I went to Kota, Rajasthan. My parents enrolled me in 'Resonance Classes', paying a hefty sum of rupee one point five lakh for the year. The sheer volume of students was overwhelming. Each batch had about two hundred to two hundred and fifty students. The classes started at eight AM sharp, with back-to-back lectures on Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. We barely had time to breathe, let alone understand what was being taught."}

They flew through the syllabus, solving complex problems in seconds. We, on the other hand, were struggling to keep up. The daily homework was a mountain – easily fifty to sixty problems per subject. Sleepless nights became the norm. My room became a mess of textbooks, notes, and half-eaten Maggi packets."}

Scoring anything above fifty percent felt like a victory. I remember one Physics test where I scored just twenty divided by one hundred and twenty. It was crushing. Doubts began to creep in. Was I cut out for this?"}

We were expected to revise everything we had learned during the week. Many students formed study groups, but I preferred studying alone. The pressure was immense. I started losing interest in everything else. No movies, no hanging out with friends, just endless studying. One day, I caught myself calculating derivatives in my sleep!"}

Getting a teacher's attention was like winning a lottery. They also had something they called \"Rankers Batch\" for those consistently scoring high marks. I aspired to be in that batch."}

I went back home to Patna. My parents were happy to see me, but they were also anxious. They constantly asked about my progress. I tried to put on a brave face, but deep down, I knew I wasn't doing as well as I should be."}

The syllabus had to be completed by January. We were bombarded with mock tests. I started experiencing panic attacks. My performance remained inconsistent.

It was a valuable learning experience, even though I didn't crack the I-I-T. I learned the importance of hard work, discipline, and perseverance. And I realized that there are many paths to success, not just one. I ended up pursuing my B.S.C. in Computer Science from a college in Delhi, and I'm doing just fine. Perhaps coaching isn't for everyone."}
